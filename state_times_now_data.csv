clearly things are changing for the

but part of what needs to keep
developing is actually the economy the
employment opportunities
the the whole you know the ecosystem

we should not expect that there will not

they will and it's not necessarily
limited to the Western neighbor there
may be others as well
the issue with Sark is
that you have a member who's actually
followed none of the basic rules of
international relations
you know when
how to be a member of an organization
which a country which not only
conducts terrorism but actually asserts
its right to do so is a problem

edition of Paul pearls as political
parties are there on the last leg of the
campaign rally now we are discussing
about the poll promises which they have
made some of the poll promises have
created the controversies some of the
promises have generated a lot of
curiosity whether they remain only poll
promises or there actually be
implementable we are discussed about
this Johnny with me is a panel of uh
eminent personalities here to my left is
vinesh srinivasa a citizen journalist
activist and also a lawyer also Mr Abdul
razak uh right to my right is a BJP
spokesperson Mr prashanth and liberte is
Mr saravana member of legislative
Council and also member of the JDS party
first welcome to you Mr razak the
premium has said that the revd culture
is being promoted by a political parties
especially opposition parties you made
several promises in your podcast
campaign how do you justify the revenue
culture which political party does not
promise before elections what about
bjp's three-cylinder plan
for BJP whatever they do it is the other
party is whatever they do they just go
ahead and say that what these people are
doing is wrong you come to dynastic
politics so many people are given
tickets in Karnataka as well but they
speak only what they want now I am
trying to convey to you whatever has
been promised to the people has is been
promised only to upkeep unlike the BJP
which in 2019 made 600 promises could
not keep up even 60 promises so before
that the sidramaya government they
promised 500 you know promises they have
kept all the promises that they made so
today I'm trying to convey what's in it
foreign
man so whatever promises we are making
is for the common man but the bgp is
attacking saying that they are promising
based on the governance but what you're
doing is freebies in the past four years
Karnataka has not seen governor I'm
really sorry you ask anybody on the
ground all that they saw was hatred all
that they saw was corruption each and
every Department wrote to Prime Minister
Modi when it comes to police department
PSI scam the Bitcoin scam kovitzcam the
you know in education department there
was teacher recruitment Camp each and
every Department had corruption to a
level of 40 percent let me take that
question to Prashant Prashant this
saying that they while your PM is saying
there's a gravity culture being
practiced by Congress what about your
yours promise half liter milk you
promised uh also free bus passes for
women how do you justify your everyday
culture Imran
is a fundamental difference in what is a
freebie and where you are giving
something to empower people for example
during the covet crisis 80 crore people
were given free ration you cannot call
it a freebie because it was a necessity
charges
no no are you talking about 40 let me
respond to that by saying Lok Sabha 1984
1985 unherald and majority of 403 seats
were given to Indian National Congress
and what is the statement of the then
prime minister Rajiv Gandhi for every
100 rupees that goes out from my coffers
15 rupees reaches the poor which means
Congress is 85 percent commission sarkar
because they will wherever is a scam
there is Congress it starts on the Jeep
scam Augusta Westland
forget the parties we need to speak from
the citizen perspective Bangalore is in
a real crisis today just take the simple
issue of public transport we have only
6500 buses out of which only 5600 are on
the road because the state government
has told bmtc you cannot hire new
drivers if you see the BJP Manifesto of
2018 they said we will double the fleet
instead of doubling the fleet we have
lesser buses on the road today my
question is whatever it is
so what happens people are traveling
bone by Metro also and there's lot of
connectivity in Metro therefore
alternate modes when you're comparing
bus versus Metro people are taking Metro
leadership is an all-time high so
therefore see you can't pick and choose
saying why there's a bus down here or
why why is the Congress is alleging that
out of the 2018
yes
this is the fight between the national
party and regional party that is the JDS
party
see now already five years National
Party
Congress and BJP both I'm I'm making
counter because of this five-year
peoples of Karnataka given the mandatory
to Congress and BJP so but your your
party has asked to write off loans
entirely of SCC success
even 2018 what we have promised you to
give the Karnataka Connecticut and
Farmers what do you think so it's
probably especially pragmatic when you
party leadership
she's made a statement saying that take
the loan say don't pay back street and
how are you going to pay back it's a
burden on the state see that's what it
is see our Karnataka always in finance
and whatever this Source always people
sir kannadigas especially
uh we are getting the number two in
India Karnataka is the number two places
in Revenue more about the expenditure on
the state let me go texture no no that's
what that's what Paul manifestos really
matter do citizens do you think really
look up the poll management Manifesto is
there accountability do you think that
of the what they're promising in that
poll management because the poll
manifestos really matter because we need
to know what the parties are promising
but I'm sorry to say that the parties
have released and manifest was so late
that it becomes difficult for citizens
to read the manifestos and figure out
what they're saying for example if you
look at the ruling party in the 2018
Manifesto they said they'll strengthen
District hospitals with public with the
central government funds but what
happened actually was that nine District
hospitals were privatized now again in
the manifesto this time they said that
they'll strengthen distinct hospitals
but you know for us to go through all
this it has to be released in time if
you are going to release it one week
before how are we going to be able to
release all the manifestos the last
release the manifesto is the Congress Mr
razak yeah
and citizens have no time to respond to
that see in this is a very uh close
competition in this time if you go ahead
and release the manifesto earlier the
opposition parties do get time to go
ahead and make similar kind of promises
or exceed the promises
promising you know 200 units of
electricity you have promised 3000
rupees for degree holder definitely yes
because this government was not able to
go ahead and fulfill the government
vacancies what about those people those
graduates and those diploma holders what
would they do do you expect them to go
ahead and do some crime that is the
reason why the Congress has come ahead
and yes
two years
stop this rubbish
a lot of flooding because of climate
change even yesterday in slums with just
a little bit of rain yesterday slums
have water entering their houses
[Music]
water has entered the slums water has
entered poor households and not just
that because of climate change farmers
are also suffering what I want to know
is that why have the parties not
mentioned what they will do climate
change only JDS has mentioned that
because of natural calamities farmers
are suffering so we'll pay compensation
but what are the parties doing to
address
our conversations
look at it this way compensation
wherever there's a crop loss or whatever
farmers are being compensated there's no
every
which means direct benefit transfer is
happening with the account of the
farmers there is no in between there
when Kumar Swami and siddrama were
ruling it in their 15-month period what
are the number of beneficials they've
given for this game 17 people now more
than 50 lakh Farmers have been benefited
so therefore we know what the JDs and
Congress is that okay
don't tell lies see listen see this is
not the ways
three and a four years what they have
given for the development uh fund and
whatever the uh now showing the road
show and Mr Prime Minister is doing all
those things if they had really done the
development no need to come here no need
to show all these things
[Music]
so in roads are you looking roads how is
the roads and the Pathos and how they
are making the 40 commission they are
not debate on that
developments
of evidence
why are they not asking what's on the
name of Mr
how are you going to fulfill it if you
take up the financial affairs of the
past four years all that has gone in 40
percent if you just add it to the
government and the governance these
promises can easily be maintained now
let me tell you Karnataka is a wonderful
place we have many resources here we can
easily maintain manage when other states
like Tamil Nadu other states can do it
why cannot Karnataka do it we have
already implemented this the rise scheme
was already implemented by sarkar the
military rupees
is this when taxes are weighed off for
software companies they're not called
freebies when something is given for the
poor why is it called free piece why are
software companies in Bangalore after
two decades still working in tax-free
software technology Parts but what about
the poor you know during covet domestic
workers were given just 2 000 and even
that the process to apply was online and
so difficult that they could not get it
let's talk about no taxes
and BJP imranji Congress and BJP they
are not never rise about Farmers living
so only our icon is the JDS party format
double engine government in this
Karnataka the number two development
many states are discussions happen on
dining table and they fight over dinner
because we know
education
I want to congratulate him if he will
just allow me Mr Prashant I want to
congratulate you because the Karnataka
state has become number one in education
so the fact that in the fact that we
have the highest number of vacancies in
government schools for teachers why is
it that a state which has to move
forward in education we moved backward
if you see the education levels
education levels have dropped so much
much Beyond any other states and instead
of doing corrective classes after covet
we were busy with textbook revision we
were busy
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
only to
first time in the history of Karnataka
all the private unaided and aided
schools 16 000 schools together wrote to
Prime Minister Modi about the rampant
corruption happening in you know the
education department BC nagesh very
formerly very clearly known as
wanted the children to go ahead and do
Surya namaskar they wanted to take out
syllabus about tipu Sultan they wanted
to take off
to primaries
foreign
degree courses and UVC is you know
bangalore's Premier engineering college
is the only available Government College
because of the state government's policy
saying that they have to be autonomous
they have no money now and they're not
able to hire teachers why are we this
why are we destroying UBC which is the
only government engineering College we
have one question for Mr azak we are
saying about old pensions King you made
a big promise in Himachal Pradesh why
didn't the up government implemented it
see let me tell you one thing to
understand what their promise it is
Congress they never Implement sir you
promised 600 things in your past
Manifesto not even 60 were okay
promise
came but wives why didn't the UPA
Government after 2014 went back to that
that's a question of Egypt is largely
strong and stable government in
Karnataka is about to come we will roll
back to the old pensions scheme
that's the question the question is why
it's not designed by one or two people
it is the feeling of the people which
has been taken you know
they wanted to ban
what will it do
no budget will be allocated in a to
ensure that this type of anti-hindu
activities are the love Jihad do not
happen and our daughters and sisters are
not lured into this in this
anti-national and anti-hinduism
one minute one minute there's a specific
thing to be mentioned about women over
here
which are centers to address domestic
and sexual violence survivors in
Karnataka we have close 71 of those
cameras
what will it do
radicalization unit what will it do how
much budget is allocated on that see
this is in the manifesto we have brought
about that what we are going to do once
we will come back to Power you will on
May 13 to look at it once we come back
to Power the details roadmap will be
laid out and then taken on record I am
repeating BJP is going to storm back to
Power because
[Applause]
everything see we will come to the power
and we will look at the common people
no no no no no no no don't say that
results will be announced on May 13th
which store the people who believe in
whom they'll vote for we have to
currency but the big promises made by
political parties
whom they will choose what which program
is they believe in will see on May 13th

how they became a part of the Indian
army
why do the world's biggest superpowers
want them in their forces
the world's Mightiest soldiers
this is their story
[Music]
about 120 kilometer Northwest of
Kathmandu gorkha is a small District in
Nepal in today's context but with
immense historic significance where a
majority of people belonging to the tapa
magar Guru right right reside
Kings generals and the army of gorkha
conquered several small scattered
kingdoms into one big region and name
the whole region Nepal in around 1767-80
gorkha and the British fought against
each other in various military
engagements this later contributed to a
national level agreement that gave the
British their right to recruit Court
cars under their flagship
since the British had colonized India
and gorkha's fought for the British they
became British Indian gurkhas until the
partition of India after the
independence of India in 1947 of the
existing 10 regiments of British Indian
goldcars Four were separated and taken
by the British
regiments of British Indian goldcars
that remained in India to serve the
country became the Indian gurkhas
they started their military operation
and development under the name Indian
gorkhas under the Indian army
the relationship between India and Nepal
has been rolling downhill in the last
decade
in June 2022 India launched the
agneepath scheme for the Indian Armed
Forces by making it a way of recruitment
at a young age and retiring three-fourth
of the badge every four years but the
new scheme had no provision for a
pension scheme and that did not sit well
with the Youth of Nepal why is that
because so far Indian army has been a
lucrative option for The Nepalese youth
as the payment has been 2.5 times where
the Nepalese Army pays and the pension
provides economic and social security
the job in the Indian army also provides
Nepalese Nationals with the option to
settle down in India the salaries and
pensions of the Indian army golkar
soldiers form a significant part of
income in rural Nepal
The Nepalese soldiers in the Indian army
bring 620 million US dollars in
remuneration while Nepal's defense
budget is 420 million US dollars
The Nepalese government led by the
Communists who are against Nepalese
gorkhas serving an Indian army
historically halted the recruitment
process using the refusal by the Indian
government to make an exception for the
gorkha soldiers under the agnipat scheme
the Indian establishment has been hoping
that the recruitment process will
commence once elections are over in
Nepal but so far there has been no
movement this year not a single Nepalese
youth is joining the Indian army
foreign
communist China which has long been
intrigued by the motivation behind
Nepalese youth joining the Indian army
May seek the communist government in
Nepal to allow the gold cars to join its
people's Liberation Army if that happens
China will only be the third country in
the world to recruit gorkha Soldiers the
other two being the United Kingdom and
India
this is an apparent effort by China
which Under The Mao Zedong plan wanted
to gobble up Nepal as one of the Five
Fingers of the occupied Tibet to exploit
the communist government in Nepal in
order to eventually create an anti-india
sentiment in the Himalayan Nation after
the 1962 war with India pla had also
requested Nepal for Gurkha soldiers but
Nepal turned the request down however
will Kathmandu refused to adhere to
China's request this time
[Music]
the second reason why goldcar soldiers
might end up in pla is that they are
unhappy with the British army unlike the
Indian army the British army does not
treat the Gopher soldiers as equals they
are discriminated against and paid
lesser than their British counterparts
the Gold Coast soldiers in the British
army have been fighting for equality for
decades now from going on hunger strikes
outside 10 Downing Street to pleading to
the British government for better pay
the gold cars have done it all
meanwhile this situation back in Nepal
is changing today Nepal is led by a
communist government and a communist
prime minister pushpakamaldah he has
opened key trade routes between Nepal
and China
's funds are flowing into Nepal days ago
Nepal had said that China was releasing
80 billion rupees meant for various
infrastructure projects in Nepal but why
does China want to recruit korkha
soldiers when it has an active pla
working for it day and night this is
because the pla troops are not combat
ready
while the gorkha soldiers have proved
their metal in the various Wars India
fought in 1947-48
1965
[Music]
and 1971 against Pakistan
and also the one against China in 1962.
with such dissatisfaction from the
Indian government over the agneepath
scheme and with the pro-china communist
government in Nepal China can totally
exploit the situation and recruit as
many gorkas as possible

Jaishankar addressed a SCO meeting today.",2023-05-05T06:17:40Z,TIMES NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ck9F18sAU5w/hqdefault.jpg,"external affairs minister doctors
Shankar spoke just a couple of minutes
ago before he went ahead with the
schedule for the day before we are to
witness several powerful visuals of
bilateral engagements that will take
place on part of the external affairs
minister his message was sent out loud
and clear especially focusing on the
issue of terrorism Russia was joining us
with more details rishabh it's very very
significant keeping in mind several
factors including how you have the
Pakistan foreign minister attend the SEO
meet who of course spoke of why he's
there who spoke of the commitment to the
SEO Summit and that's exactly why the by
the country was participating in the
same though no bilaterals must be
expected but the external affairs
minister making sure that the message
remains intact let me go across tomorrow
Frozen the meanwhile I'll come back to
urisha
what do you make of the external affairs
minister sending out this message right
in the beginning of the second day of
the SEO meeting at a time where you have
the Pakistan foreign minister also in
attendance
well it's been a bit of a diplomatic
coup on the part of the Indian
government to get Mr
to India and the pakistanis have been
hankering to be seen to be engaging with
India because their entire foreign
policy narrative is based on
how they engage with India on Kashmir
the second thing is that Mr Bilal Bhutto
may have been briefed in detail by his
foreign office but is relatively
immature on issues related with
geostatic matters whether it is the SEO
or india-pakistan relations I have seen
earlier film cutting the film humping
his chest and shouting out loud
you see the Bhutto family has used
anti-indianism as their calling card and
therefore we cannot expect any great
concessions from him but at the same
time
India is going to use this opportunity
to convey a Stern message about battling
terrorism which is one of the key areas
of Engagement amongst SEO leaders
and then finding a way forward to
counter terrorism Pakistan will continue
to deny it because Pakistan the entire
foreign policy is based on a two-sided
approach of using terrorists as friends
and policy makers to influence their
relationship with India and finally and
most importantly the SEO Summit is not
about India and Pakistan the SEO Summit
is about all the countries that make up
SEO and SEO is an important grouping
which is largely pushed through by China
and Russia within which India came in
with Pakistan later at the time of
vajpai Ji
as an observer and over a period of time
has got regular rise but the SEO itself
has miles to go because there are issues
where India has got its put in the SEO
Camp as well in the T20 Camp as well as
quad as well as its engagement with the
United States Europe and other countries
so let us not expect too much out of the
SEO Summit okay let us be realistic and
I think Mr Jason could giving a firm
message to Pakistan
is very much in order to convey to
Pakistan that we stand firm on getting
Pakistan to abandon terrorism as a tool
of foreign policy absolutely it's also a
message in that sense to all those who
have in fact been asking the government
or why is it that we do see Pakistan's
foreign minister participate in the SEO
meet while Pakistan wants to draw the
line and continue to maintain that it's
you know living up to the SEO Charter uh
here's how Pakistan also in that sense
stands completely exposed thank you Mr
Raza for speaking to us going across to
rishab once again rishabh yesterday is
when we broke down a story and details
of the same on the Pakistan propaganda
you know which is playing out over the
G20 event that's to take place later
this month uh in Kashmir uh we exposed
you know how Pakistan is peddling
several hashtags on Twitter on
boycotting the G20 event now you know
wanting to in that sense take that moral
High ground and say that look we're
going to oblige by the SEO Charter but
here is the external affairs still
giving it back in as many words
has landed in India he has been trying
to Showcase that how Pakistan is not
interested in bilaterals with India but
he is only here to be part of SEO and
Pakistan respects SEO Charter we also
had a tweet from Sharif the prime
minister of Pakistan on the same lines
that how Pakistan's participation shows
Pakistan's commitment toward sco Charter
but one thing is very clear India has
given it back in the most appropriate
language excellent affairs minister
going ahead and saying the terrorism the
Menace of terrorism is haunting this
region and it is a clear message that
India will not back down on the issue of
terrorism until uh the time when the
terrorism is taken seriously by your
neighbor carpet welcome for Pakistan
once again sending out the message of
how this is going to be zero tolerance

concerned especially the ones emanating
from Pakistan thank you for",True,en,3845,5,47

there are posters that have been spotted
questioning the 45 crore rupee Splurge
as times now continues to put out those
questions on when is it that chief
minister arvind kejawal will break his
silence after the biggest pitchers have
been put out by times now navbharat on
what the sheesh Mahal actually looks
like remember we're talking about a
massive 45 crore rupees Splurge not in
renovating the chief Minister's
residence the official residence but his
Bungalow in fact reconstructing His
official Bungalow coming about with an
alternative Bungalow after that raising
the old official Bungalow we've put out
all those details since yesterday we've
been breaking down all of that and much
more and in the meanwhile these are the
kind of posters that have been with is
that have been spotted such is joining
us with more details on what these
posters are really trying to imply
sabyasachi what are these posters about
well absolutely see I'll show you the
posters which has been put out right in
front of Changi namakada and these
posters has been put out across the road
which leads to cm's Residence and it is
written that
Innovation
so the BJP has been saying that the
money which has been spent on the
renovation on the Reconstruction is the
taxpayers money that cmkjiwal has put
out they have also put out several
posters saying that the BJP is organized
Vishal dharna in the national capital
and the protest has started from 1st of
May and this is the fifth day of the
protest that the BJP is going to carried
out uh we have seen several leadership
from the bhatija party uh SRI lakhi
leader of opposition from uh Delhi
ramveer Singh bidhuri former Union
minister Dr harshvardhan all of them
have come here and protested against
cmkjiwala and they have been saying that
cmkjiwal should put his resignation on
moral ground they also questioned that
at the time when arvind kejriwal was
questioning the central government time
and again asking the central government
to release one so that he can save the
life of the people in the national
capital because of the shortage of
oxygen at that particular time this
massive amount was spent at the
renovation of his Mansion the BJP has
said that this money could have been
used for buying ventilators or oxygen
concentrators but rather it was used for
the beautification of CM kejriwal's
residence and that is the reason why the
BJP is organizing this massive protest
here in the national capital meanwhile
the stage has been put out here at uh
on the stage the posters has been put
out uh you can see uh the pictures of
kejriwal's residence has been put out
saying that 45 crores
Mahal and they are saying that BJP would
be holding this Vishal dharna here today
and it would continue till arvind
kejriwal opens uh the door of his
residence for the media uh though we
time and again times now times under
Bharat have been trying to get a
response from cmk uh recently he did a
press conference he spoke on the issue
related to pollution he gave the report
card of his government but he hasn't
spoken anything on the operation she
smile so far and that is a reason why
the BJP has been holding this protest
and demanding answers from cm's kejriwal
okay not a word so far from the chief
minister he has of course gone ahead
with a couple of press conferences but
nothing so far on why this massive 45
crore rupee why this kind of an amount
is trying to revamp His official
Residence at a time at a time the entire
country he was battling covert 19. those
are the questions that continue to be
put out to the ahmadmi party but as far
as the BJP protest is concerned so far
it's been limited to the national
capital any plans of taking it Beyond
because the ahmadmi party most certainly
does have a presence in several other
states as well what's the BJP plan at
the at the you know the long term
well absolutely see the BJP had earlier
announced that from May 1st they would
be holding continuous protests right in
front of CMS residents and today is the
fifth day of protest and the BJP has
said that after seven days the BJP would
take out this protest in different parts
of the national capital uh their
committee would go to different Corners
different Lanes in the national capital
to tell people about uh this huge amount
which has been spent by CM kejriwal for
the Construction office Bungalow and how
this amount could have been used uh for

well absolutely see the BJP has been
continuously protesting Narnia uh CM
arvind kejriwal's residence uh from the
last couple of days and today also the
BJP is going to uh protest at a massive
scale where several leadership from the
bhatijanda party uh will be coming in
near cm's residence to protest against
CM arvind kejriwal now they have been
calling that cmk jiwal is no longer
ahmadmi he has become a khasadmi and the
amount that has been spent on the
Reconstruction of the CMS Bungalow at
the time when the entire national
capital was uh dealing with oxygen
crisis and the BJP has been questioning
that this is the particular cmy Russian
Prime Minister Narendra Modi that prime
minister Narendra Modi should give fund
to the national capital so that arvind
kejriwal can buy oxygen for the people
of Delhi but on the other hand he has
been spending lavishly at the
Reconstruction of his this entire
Bungalow meanwhile I'm standing right in
front of cm's residence you can see the
glimpse of the Bungalow which has been
reconstructed spending around 45 crores
in the Reconstruction and the renovation
work uh with remote control curtains and
automatic doors for the CM with high-end
state-of-the-art facility inside the
mansion and the BJP has said that they
would continue the protest here in the
national capital for the coming for the
several coming days and they have also
posted several pictures in the way
towards cm's resident questioning arvind
kejriwal and question because even after
these pictures even after the files came
out even now there's absolute Silence
from the test he has not spoken on a
word on this expose a let me also go
across to Aditi who is joining us with
the bjps attack on arvind kejriwal
putting up these posters these photos
showing the extravagance of the chief
minister
well BJP is clear on their stand is FIFA
of Raja kejriwal that's what the demand
of the BJP is right now that even after
being silent there's no need to say
anything but to resign because the
Ahmadi party the Qatar imanda image of
the kejriwal has been washed out by
times now's expose it now you can see
has put out some interesting images
saying
and this is the image that he has put
out this is the poster that the BJP is
right now attacking party with this is
the Raj Mahal directed and produced by
arvind kejriwal a true story of
renovating the Raj Mahal with 45 crores
by Common Man so they are saying that we
funded the Common Man funded the Raj
Mahal of kejriwal and upping the ante at
11AM BJP will hold a mega protest
against the Delhi cm
okay all right this is a picture that
has been put up arvind kejriwal with the
BJP remember has been saying that this
is Mughal era kind of extravagance that
we've seen in his residence and look at
the amount of money that has been spent
and what's important to note is the
hypocrisy of it all because this
extravagance came at a time when arvind
keishivar had been saying that it does
not have money asking the center for
funds during the covet pandemic",True,en,2408,19,40

square meters or 13
046 square feet on Delhi six Flagstaff
road right in front of your eyes
on camera for the first time you see the
actual Bungalow that arvind kejriwal and
family stays in for the first time on
television we had asked so far on the
day that we broke the story we said why
don't you let in our cameras into your
house simply so that the people of Delhi
can see the inside of this house that
day the taxpayer has paid for Mr K-12
did not oblige so we did this is the
three floor mansion that has been built
from scratch for the chief minister not
prepared not renovated not added to not
just having its ceiling fixed because
apparently it fell in but built Brick by
Brick tap by tap marble floor by marble
floor wooden paneling by wooden paneling
and this viewers is just the beginning
over the next four hours on times now we
we will show you every curtain every
parking that famed Pearl Dior marble
take you inside those tempting toilets
with their lovely vanities they're
beautiful jacuzzis don't worry it's all
here on times now no exaggerating no
faking this is the real deal right here
on camera let me actually show you these
pictures in detail of the she smell
this is the exterior of the three-story
Bungalow that stands now at six
Flagstaff road this is occupied by Mr
kejriwal his parents and his children a
closer look this by the way we must
remember that earlier we had been told
that oh the original House its roof
caved in that the the ceiling of the
room that Mr kejriwal's father lives in
that caved in hence repair work had to
be done no this house has been built a
new almost reminds you of the White
House doesn't it but this is what Mr
kejriwal the Delhi chief minister lives
in we are joined Now by matadas gopala
Krishnan we also have pulkit joining us
live from delhi's Secretariat
and himanshu is also live with us
foreign
foreign
now let's take a closer look at this
house and I'll bring in madhav on this
here you see this and like we just had
uh you know our correspondent telling us
that there is pulkit was just telling us
that there is an entrance now you would
remember that earlier video when say you
had uh uh you know you had Mr kejri
while hosting kcr at his house or other
leaders you usually see a visual and
here is the parking this is where the
cars come in there is a ground floor
where there is a meeting Hall that
pulkit was talking about that would
approximately be over here but the
living quarters are here on the first
floor and a massive balcony one assumes
that these would be the bedrooms with
large plate glass windows you can see
them heavily hooded heavily curtained
and a huge you know it's like what you
call a wrap around balcony when you look
at those advertisements inside you know
inside some of those housing societies
when they're advertising luxurious
living they'll say you have a wrap
around balcony which basically means
that this will be the house and the
balcony will be all around it you get a
clearer idea when you see this picture
of the whole house lit up at night there
you can see the the living quarters more
clearly in the lighting from behind the
curtains and the balcony runs right
across it one would assume that mother
that any time in the morning when you
want to look at the Glorious Morning Sun
you can just step out of your bedroom
and you have the entire expanse of Delhi
in front of you
we're talking about uh house an
accommodation that is a sprawling 13 000
square feet and that is a massive amount
of space By Any standard I mean most of
people would tell you that uh even a 3
000 square foot uh you know apartment
would be something of a dream and here
we're talking about a bungalow that
spread over 13 000 square feet yes it's
absolutely opulent yes all that we have
been talking about from the marble
flooring the fame Dior marble flooring
to the expensive curtains the carpets
all of that in fact very clearly goes to
show what the priority really is of the
Delhi chief minister and also of course
let's remind our viewers let's take our
viewers back to the very starting point
of the story and why we are showing
these pictures is because all of this
expenditure which taxpayers and voters
have by the way every right to know
about how the money is being spent by
the government that they have voted to
pass was all happening through the
course of Kobe so if anybody remembers
the time remembers the difficulties
remember that this is the kind of luxury
this is the kind of opulence with which
the Delhi government was prioritizing
the chief Minister's residence who is
accountable for that is there anyone
other than Mr casual that's perhaps
something for the dinner himanshu is
actually joining us from the chief
Minister's residence as it looks right
now
foreign
[Music]
you know repeatedly people ask what's
the big deal do you expect the chief
minister in of Delhi to be living in
penury absolutely not the question here
is two-pronged the first is that we are
simply holding up the politician Mr
kejriwal and the political party
to the standards that they themselves
have set when they were starting out in
politics they said all we need is three
bedrooms
so we are asking what about those
standards and the second there is a huge
gap between comfort and wasteful
expenditure or luxury
definitely comfort and insecurity must
not be compromised on but is this about
Comfort or is this about which stage of
taxpayers money seven pictures now I
want to take you through those pictures
one by one again taking a closer look
this is a picture that we have from some
distance we are now opening the curtain
on the sheesh Mahal this is a long shot
that you have here you can see see you
see the living quarters over here then
you have the main bedrooms one presumes
would be the master bedroom you have a
wraparound balcony you have more rooms
over here on the ground floor we are
being told by pulkit is where you have
some of the meeting room some of those
pictures that you would see where VIPs
would be invited when they come for
political meetings here is another angle
you can get a better look so you've got
one parking on that side here you've got
another opening coming out from the
ground floor a massive balcony here as
well another door coming out here which
one presumes open out into this very big
long the lawn is a different story we
will tell you about that in just a
second the third picture here shows you
a larger view of the lawn in front now
you've got lawn here in front you've got
a lawn on the side the fourth picture
and we will also take a look at these
pictures by night because when the house
is lit up you can get a better idea of
what lies here see now you can see when
you've got the back lighting happening
also very interesting
remember
when we were doing operation sheeshmael
and some of the more intricate
expenditures there were 24 pillars each
pillar was at the cost of 88 000 rupees
one wonders if these pillars which also
almost make it seem like either the
White House or if any of you have been
to Connaught place you see the entire
exterior of the Connaught place it's
almost like you know those massive
pillars but are they worth 88 000
apparently yes so 24 of these 88 000
worth of pillars here you see them in
the daytime massive pillars here
apparently this house has 24 of them
this is the house you see that is spread
across 13 046 square feet or seven acres
I want to before I show you the
comparison I want to show you this by
day and by night
here you see during the day you see a
lot of you know the in the exterior you
see a lot of these light fittings very
nice lit up lawn one you have a back
lighting you've got a lot of lighting
under the pillar so that you know the
facade of the building is really
beautiful at night and then of course
you've got the lawn also entirely lit up
just out of curiosity you know madhav a
lot of people say that this is an
unnecessary hullabaloo because any other
person whether it be a member of
parliament whether it be any other chief
minister they pretty much have the same
standards as well their houses look just
the same you've been to plenty of them
how does this compare
well I don't think I have seen anything
that compares to the level of grandeur
opulence luxury whatever you choose to
term it that has been you know very
clearly spent and very clearly is seen
in these visuals in any of these other
houses that we are talking about
remember that this is an expense of
about 45 crores and that is whopping by
any standards now they may say that
there are chief ministers who will later
occupy this house this is public
expenditure that money has been spent
there are vanity projects that the
central government has engaged in but
remember that we're talking about very
different set of houses over here that
is the the prime minister's residence
for instance or the vice president's
residence which is being built is a
complete re-haul it is a complete
restructuring and it is for a multiple
set of reasons that those constructions
are happening as part of the larger
Central Vista project can it really be
compared to this is a very very big
question because the kind of scale that
we're talking about here not just the
kind of you you know opulence are the
kind of spending and who accounts for
the spending you know there are
individuals who may on their personal
expense for instance you know try and
change certain aspects of the house try
and retro fit certain aspects of the
house but all of this is happening are
the public expense and that is what
makes this an extremely shocking case a
one where an individual who comes out
and says that even two flats are too
much for him that he wants to shift into
a smaller house will not take a lalbati
car as we all know Mr casual had
famously announced what happened to
those standards suddenly where did they
all disappear did he forget them did
someone else in his party forget them
and what has happened they have to come
there and explain after these pictures
have come out because I think that if no
one else at least the voters of Delhi
deserve an answer from Principal
question that we're asking that's the
very very simple question let me take
this across to our to our guests as well
but before I do that let our guests also
get a perspective on how we are showing
this house
versus some of the other buildings in
Delhi and elsewhere now just to give you
this perspective this house is spread
over seven acres
the Taj Palace Hotel in Delhi is spread
over six acres it's the Taj Palace Hotel
it spread over six acres and the udaipur
lake Palace that is literally a palace
is spread over five acres Mr kejriwal's
new mansion in look in field in size and
clearly in expense is no less than a
palace fit for Kings
the guest joining us now Sanju Verma
National spokesperson of BJP kailash
adhikari MD governance now and Advance
shikha Mukherjee senior journalist are
you are you satisfied that this does
look like something that is worth 45
crore rupees
I really have no clue I have no idea
what 45 crores would look like on a
renovated building but I cannot only say
this and I did you know I dislike this
what about uh what about autism that
goes on but Frankly Speaking there is
the profligacy
of public leaders in India is disgusting
and it starts from the very top
it starts from the very top because you
know 89 crores spent on the Prime
Minister as the president is being
renovated then another 400 or 500 crores
being spent on his new residence
um and then in between
there are places that you know you are
talking about this Grand structure and
Flagstaff road Frankly Speaking what
about the Mumbai mayor's Bungalow look
at that it's a Heritage building it's
beautiful it's huge
answer that because she actually comes
from Mumbai the prime minister's
residents are not entirely sure is a
fair comparison because he is the prime
minister he has a certain threat
perception
there is no way in which any exceptions
can be made
the prime minister of India Public faces
a death threat from all Terror
organizations surely you cannot compare
the level of security that he needs to
get to anybody else may I please can you
please
heads of states
there is no difference in the need for a
security Arrangements be an office
really
um
start by answering the mayor if only a
mayor can live in a Heritage Bungalow in
Bombay in Mumbai what is the problem
with Mr casual profligacy is party
diagnostic you know first and foremost
let me tell you that the lady had the
audacity to compare
renovated or newly constructed house
with what the Prime Minister enjoys
please Madam don't compare apples with
watermelons Arvin kejriwal is the chief
minister of Delhi party I did not
disturb you please keep quiet um
one at a time go on Sanju Verma 30
seconds please thank you yes you know
look at the importance of this lady she
made wild allegations the moment I
started giving my viewpoint she started
heckling me if you make allegations
Madam have the audacity to listen to the
response first and foremost the central
Vista project including North block
South block the prime minister's
residence everything has been upheld
twice by the Supreme Court and twice by
the Delhi high court let us tell me
whether arvind kejri was this sheesh
Mahal has been approved by any
regulatory body or the course so don't
compare you know apples with watermelons
Point number two Let me also tell you
that Mumbai Mayors Bungalow is indeed a
Heritage structure but each time a
renovation has to be done for the mayor
the provision for additional Amounts is
made in the Maharashtra state budget and
that is the legal thing to do I want to
ask whether arvind kejriwal made an
extra budgetary or a budgetary provision
in the daily budget when he knew that he
had to splurge 45 crores so when you
spend taxpayers money without making
extra budgetary or budgetary Provisions
that is actually freezing the taxpayers
back aside Miss Mukherjee if if the
mayor of Mumbai has spent 45 crores on
renovating that Bungalow even that is
extremely wasteful I sincerely urge you
let me finish eye for that and there
must be action taken for that as well 45
remember can I just finish anyone is not
okay I really I am sorry to interrupt
you because we've had Union Minister
thakur reacting to times now's exclusive
news break saying that the people now
will know the real face of somebody who
pledged that he would be a
into the first reaction from Union

today we reveal Pakistan's wishes plot
once again to spread its propaganda and
sabotage the G20 meet in Kashmir which
will be held later this month Pakistan
remember now is running social media
campaigns against the G20 meet has
Unleashed this fake propaganda to
instigate local sentiments these handles
are also seen celebrating the recent
punch attack in which five Indian jawans
remember were martyr they were also
articles that have been written in
Pakistani media the G20 meet in Kashmir
there's also proof that Canada's NDP has
also been supporting the boycott against
G20 in Kashmir NDP leader jagmeet Singh
has tweeted calling for a boycott of the
meat so open support from one of the
political parties in Canada open support
from several in jnk remember we already
seen how some in Jammu and Kashmir and
we're talking about some of the
mainstream politicians have not been
quite happy with the G20 meet that is
slated for later this month but yes now
you have this Pakistan propaganda that
stands completely exposed let's quickly
take you through it
detail by detail on what is it that
times now has been able to access so far
we talk about this vicious plot and
essentially tell you about the details
of how this is what we've been able to
nail Pakistan propaganda against G20
Summit and Genki completely stands
exposed that's the takeaway number one
social media campaigns being run to save
the G20 up until now there were
reactions coming in from politicians
within Jammu and Kashmir who are not
quite happy but here's the Pakistani
link that has come out in the open
Pakistan handles with hashtags calling
for G20 boycott we'll take you through
some of those hashtags as well but
terror attack by paff the head of G20
tourism meet in Srinagar now this is
where the direct pulvama attack link
also comes in remember five of our
bravehearts were martyred in this attack
Chinese armor-piercing bullets were
found at the attack site but here's
where the entire Pakistan links become
very very suspicious in nature Twitter
handles condemned the G20 meet also
celebrate Terror attacks on one hand
you're against the development push that
is taking place that continues to take
place in Jammu and Kashmir and in stock
contradiction the same elements the same
Twitter handles are in support of the
terror attacks that continue to take
place oppose the events citing human
rights abuses against minorities the
same old Narrative of how all is not
been well ever since article 370 was
advocated in the valley propaganda
received full support and coverage from
Pakistani media so there is a full-blown
support that we can witness around these
hashtags some of them of course being
tweeted by Pakistani journalists
themselves in fact let me quickly go
across to Kitty because these hashtags
need to be looked at very very carefully
Kitty tell us more
between as you rightly mentioned how
Pakistan has been spreading this social
media this online campaign on social
media and trying to spread anti-g20
sentiment these are various tweets that
have been put out by these handles first
hashtag which is G20 boycott meeting in
what they call what Pakistan calls
Kashmir as Indian occupied Jammu Kashmir
this was created by a voice of i i o j k
one Handler uh on 12th of April 2023
this is the second hashtag that said G20
boycott meeting in JK this Saturday
G20 Nation should realize India's
ulterior motives behind holding the
groupings meeting in Jammu Kashmir and
this is the third hashtag that has been
doing the rounds on social media G20
event in IO jk just deployed this uh
Twitter user here says Modi regime's
plan to hold G20 meeting in Srinagar is
part of its ploy to give false
impression of normalcy in Jammu Kashmir
this is the fourth hashtag that has been
doing the rounds on social media this is
G20 event in IO jk just deploy this says
Modi regimes plan to hold G20 Summit in
Srinagar part of ploy to give false
impression of normalcy this is the same
tweet that has been copied from the
other hashtag another hashtag that is uh
you know that is being used is Boycott
to G20 which has been created by Park
journalist nimra Chaudhary in which
nimbra Chaudhary says that Pakistan
criticizes India's move to host G20
meeting in Srinagar Pakistan boys strong
indignation over India's plans to
convince meetings linked with the G20
and saying such a move was self-serving
on New Delhi spot okay let's also
quickly go across to pradeep because you
know while there is so much excitement
pradeep around you know this event
that's later for later this month and it
certainly is going to withproof show all
of those doubters that look there's been
development there's been growth and
things have changed ever since 370 was
abrogated there are some who continue to
cast aspersions and now you have a
Pakistan link emerging a deliberate
propaganda that has been Unleashed by
Pakistan
foreign
we have to understand one thing how why
this G20 is going to be a game changer
it's going to be a game changer one that
the delegates from the different
countries will be there in kashmiri
Valley and it's going to globalize peace
and they will be seeing the change there
on the ground because all these uh
months the Pakistan had been trying to
Pedal lives uh trying to tell the world
that all is not well in Kashmir there
was in article 370 has been evergreated
but once they will be there in Kashmir
Valley they themselves will see that
people are there for tourism not there
for terrorism and how the people are
participating in all these events
because they'll be taken to different
places also and uh shown that how the
things have changed ever since article
370 has been abrogated so the second
all these years Pakistan had been trying
to tell the world that Kashmir is a
dispute and need to be a result but with
these International delegates coming out
to this place they will just put a false
stop on that propaganda that Pakistan
had been unleashing since 47 and that
Kashmir is a dispute if anything that
needs to be resolved that is about
Pakistan occupied Jamal Kashmir that's
what actually India has already made it
clear in 1994 resolution that were
passed in Parliament and again that's a
few two years back when abhisha said
that we can do anything to get Pakistan
occupied Kashmir back because people
there had been protesting and they are
coming out on street they are protesting
against Pakistan Army now we talk about
why the Pakistan is rattled and now what
the Pakistan is actually doing as my
Kali Kitty has already shown that what
Pakistan is up to on one hand where
Pakistan Army is Aging in a vetting
Terror they are trying to destabilize
peace in German ahead of G20 meet on the
other hand we've seen how the Cyber Army
is working overtime with their
two-pronged strategy where they are
trying to one melanin image of India
second they are trying to demonize our
Armed Forces saying that the human
relations are taking place third they
are trying to malign immediately
celebrated
while they're condemning and standing
against the G20 event which all of us by
the way take pride in that against that
we're going to take in our experts as
well thank you pradeep for that let's
also in the meanwhile interestingly put
out the political reactions that we've
picked up on house the likes of Farooq
Abdullah for that matter have been seen
play politics over the issue so much so
that they in fact have said and rather
proposed us to why is it that this event
the G20 event not take place in Jammu
instead of Kashmir
important yeah
well Jammu is important and so is
Kashmir so don't quite understand that
logic and let's quickly open this up
very interesting or not shocking not
surprising but something that we must
speak of febin John James cyber security
expert with us along with activist
social Shield Pandit political analyst
Majid is also with us on the broadcast
Mr Hydra my first question is to you
because there are some who have been
very unhappy with the fact that this
event is going to be held in Srinagar
but the fact remains that if it's going
to take place in several parts of the
country Jammu and Kashmir for that
matter is very much a part of our
country so why should it not take place
in Srinagar what kind of bizarre excuse
is that before we go across to our guest
for the Pakistan link that's also
emerged
well better firstly Frankly Speaking the
time has come that our BJP government
had sent it decides that National
relations with Pakistan because only
today the Pakistani foreign minister uh
foreign minister Bilal Bhutto has
arrived in our country in Goa and are we
hosting an enemy or are we hosting a
friend because since morning I could
hear the likes of kunawala singing
so are we supposed to have good
relations with this country who recently
was accused of bloodbath in punj where
five of our soldiers brave soldiers lost
their lives I mean BJP doesn't have a
policy not for the country not for the
foreign foreign policy so that is our
problem BJP has left the nation confused
on what our relations is
why should a G20 event not take place in
Srinagar what is the problem why should
it not happen
Madam the problem is that confusion
created by BJP government
talking about our neighbor Pakistan
whose involvement is there so are we in
good relations with Pakistan are we
today hosting an enemy or a friend that
is my simple question to BJP and why
don't we have somebody from BJP on the
show
priorities but but to really you know
talk about the Pakistan Angela Mr sushil
Pandit the fact remains that here's a
propaganda that's been Unleashed on part
of Pakistan you have a political party
interestingly from Canada as well which
by the way has extended support on
multiple occasions to the kalistani
cause but that said Pakistani
journalists several the Twitter handles
now launching this hashtag of boycott
G20 in Kashmir why must it not happen
sir why why is Pakistan to interfere in
any success that we see in India
why is anyone surprised
Pakistan has built an entire story of
its existence in the last 75 years on
the issue of enmity with India and
specifically it calls Kashmir its
jugular vein so the the lopsided
Narrative of Pakistan will always seek
these opportunities clutch at the straws
what are we doing is the issue why are
Pakistani elements still thriving and
surviving in Kashmir why is their
support system why is Pakistan's
strategic depth in India their
investments in Academia in media among
bureaucracy in diplomacy intact why is
Pakistan able to pull off these you know
the investments in politics specifically
why are there Stooges still running
around and thriving in Kashmir why
aren't we Prosecuting them for their
sins of omission and commission
so this is one huge question that stares
at us Pakistan will do what they think
is in their interest they will all abuse
us they will always sabotage us they
will always bleed us that is their
declared policy in their documents and
doctrines we are the enemy Nation so why
are we surprised that they do these
things what are we doing to Pakistan why
are not we smashing Pakistan to
Smithereens when they are at their
weakest in the last 75 years I see Mr
Hydra I see my Mr Hydra smile Mr ID what
makes you smile I mean isn't it true for
a fact that there were objections raised
by Pakistan to the effect that it
lobbied member states like China turkey
Saudi Arabia to prevent India from
hosting this kind of an event in Kashmir
for about one one thing with regard to
abuse he said Pakistan is abusing India
let me remind him that one of the worthy
ministers who is today here at use
abusive language against her own
honorable prime minister so should we
remind all these things to sushilji or
he's silent for some reasons because
he's here to support and defend BJP I
mean you are running outside
madam are we here to talk about our
nation or to defend BJP these are true
we are here
for its ugly propaganda sir we first and
foremost begin with the Enemy who's
trying to hit us hard
foreign
minister in India today that's the
that's the only focus that we need to
maintain we're not going to talk about
this hashtag that is being petted by
several in Pakistan forget about it you
know these are illiterates in global
diplomacy where multilateral forums
cannot have bilateral issues overhang on
them what we have with Pakistan is our
outstanding problem but SEO is a
multilateral forum India is heading SEO
how can we bar members of SEO from
coming and this is this is fun this is
kindergarten stuff
it's not as though Mr Pandit we've held
back from giving out that message loud
as well as we focus on the SEO meat
parallely hear it from him
to attend the Shanghai Corporation
organizations Council of foreign
ministers
I'm looking forward to engaging uh
bilaterally
organization
well it's not very frequently as far as
diplomatic engagements go that we see
the presence of the Pakistan foreign
minister here on the Indian soil what's
on the agenda as we keep up with this
very important story in the Pakistan
propaganda that stands completely
exposed as far as the G20 event in
Srinagar is concerned tell us about the
Pakistan foreign Minister's engagement
very interesting what he said in the
last part of his statement he says I
look forward to constructive discussions
with my counterparts from friendly
countries
definitely if you see uh one thing is
very clear that India and Pakistan do
not have any bilateral meeting uh if you
see uh the statement he says friendly
nation which shows that he might have a
meeting with China or other set relation
countries but with India because India
has drawn a clear line that Terror and
talks will not go on uh together and
hence India is not going to hold any
bilateral meeting with Pakistan as of
now what we know like Russian bilateral
meeting will begin anytime now four
o'clock is when International Affairs is
meeting his counterpart from China and
post that Uzbekistan meeting will happen
but uh on a question of Pakistan one
thing is very clear India is not
engaging with Pakistan pilotry yes
Pakistan is a full-time member and not
to forget the external affairs minister
and that's a response to Mr hydri as
well just last week had sent out that
very clear loud and clear message to
Pakistan and he said that India cannot
engage with neighbors who practice
cross-border terrorism so I'm afraid
where you're coming from febin John
James you know we're running out of time
we'll have to quickly head into a short
break apologies for not coming to you uh
we'll try and return to you after a very
short break we'll be right back

the Kerala story there is no end to
controversy that were triggered first
when the teaser was released a few
months ago two police were in Supreme
Court one seeking a complete ban on the
film and the other requesting for a
disclaimer to be added to say that it is
a work of fiction in its verdict the
Supreme Court refused to entertain the
police and told the petitioners to go to
High Courts at the same time Member of
Parliament of the CPI benoitswam then
approached the center saying that an
inquiry should be carried out into what
he called fake islamophobic propaganda
being spread by the movie amidst the
growing backlash the trailer of the film
which earlier claimed in its original
form that 32 000 women from Kerala had
joined Isis has been changed on YouTube
to say that the movie tells the true
stories of three young girls from
different parts of Kerala in just a
while we will be speaking to the
filmmakers to explain how they arrived
at those figures but before that
there is a huge
a huge shoe about
people on the one hand they are
quibbling about numbers on the other
hand there is the reality of whether
there was indoctrination radicalization
and conversion let's tell you about
women who feature in this movie the
women from Kerala who did travel to
Afghanistan to become Isis Brides along
with their husbands the pictures on your
screens were released by the ni the
women on your screens are nimisha Alias
Fatima Isa Sonia Sebastian Alias Aisha
Rafaela and meren Jacob Alias Mariam or
in in 2019 four of these women were
found in an Afghanistan jail all of them
accompanied their husbands to join the
Islamic State in the khorasan province
their husbands were killed in different
attacks in Afghanistan forcing them to
surrender but were they the only ones to
be radicalized or are there many more is
it more important to focus on numbers
and whether it is about coercion whether
it is about the so-called love Jihad
whether it is about radicalization or
about a very real threat which Chief
Ministers of Kerala have recognized
which even MPS like Shashi tarur have
recognized in the past
yes
[Music]
that's the fourth story there is no
nothing no base in that delegation
itself
in Supreme Court that there is no
evidence for loudly the foreign
debate about free speech and whether
some free speech is more equal than
others comes the Kerala story again even
before its release is already bang in
the center of multiple litigations
letters being written to the information
and broadcasting Ministry and of course
abuse and trolling what do the makers
the cast and crew the people who are
behind the entire film have to say about
allegations of islamophobia sung
propaganda and basically being a work of
fiction joining us today is producer
vipul Amrit Lal Shah we have a director
sudiptosen here with us and actor Ada
Sharma who is in the lead role I want to
start with you Mr Shah you know
the film industry is very wary of
getting into Political subjects were you
worried when you are touching an issue
like this
no actually uh to be very honest when uh
Radha came and told me about this
subject
he knows I got into tears and I was
shaken and I decided that this is my
duty
that I have to make this film it's a
it's a one of the most important subject
that I have come across in my life
and I would hate if today the film was
releasing and produced by was by
somebody else I would have never
forgotten myself
so I've forgiven myself so it was a very
instinctive and very uh moment straight
upfront decision I told the other then
and there okay we have to make this film
what was the conversation like why were
you in tears like what was it because he
narrated me and he showed me some of the
testimonies of those girls who were
victim of these manipulative conversion
and now uh they went till a certain
point but they came back and I saw so
much material I mean that was a very
long conversation and then it was like
oh my God this is what is happening in
our country to our daughters and we are
doing nothing about it and here is
opportunity yes of course the
opportunity comes with with its own
risks and it with its own
responsibilities but nonetheless it's a
very important subject that you know
come into your lab whether you have to
act upon it or you're going to be
Australian put your head in sand and say
nothing like this is happening like many
people are still claiming so I decided
it in that moment that I'm going to make
this film and we are going to make it
in a very very honest way and in very
bold way we are not going to sugarcoat
we are not going to uh you know try and
not talk about certain issues but at the
same time this is not a film against any
religion or any Community this is a film
against those terrorists who are doing
this in Kerala that's about it and I
think this subject needs to be seen by
everybody in the world not just in this
country so you you know a lot has been
said about these testimonials you said
that you've gone and met a few of those
ladies what were those stories that you
heard that made you finally decide that
you're going to do the film no I I
instinctively do a film uh if I have to
take so long to be convinced then I
always think it's I'm not meant to do it
so I was instantly convinced because
when I heard that it's about this I am
from Kerala I thought this is a story
that I'd want to be part of and I'd want
to tell
um as far as instances there are so many
and when you watch our film also there
are so many sequences that are really
disturbing
um and you've got this from from women
firsthand from women firsthand I also
saw videos that that I had shown as like
there's a sequence in our film where uh
people get stuffed into this tanker and
taken across everyone doesn't get the
luxury of going on a flight from one
place to the other they stuff them into
a tanker like a washing machine and
there's just that much space for all of
them to breathe and when they take them
off it's like taking them off out of the
washing machine the you know how we take
off clothes from the washing machine so
some bodies are mangled and some bones
broken some die and they're allowed to
die and they're Left To Die the ones who
live become so side mamas or sex slaves
the kids who live if they're boys they
grew up to be dressed or the girls can
grow up and then be groomed to be
suicide bombers or so these women that
you met they are women from Kerala there
are women from Kerala who almost went
and didn't go
um So Stories either I met them one girl
has written a book also and she's been
brave enough she's been giving
interviews as well she and another five
six girls from an institution in Kerala
who's saved many girls so they've been
giving interviews and I think it's
rather Brave of them because they live
there as well so what were their
experiences like that they told you so
it starts off with how they got
brainwashed which is again different for
different girls for some of them it was
it depends on I mean these guys were
brainwashing them are getting paid to
brainwash them that's their job so
they're really good at it but they know
who to brainwash how they look at the
girl and they they know you know this
will work on this one and this will work
on that one and maybe if she's really
smart then I just drug her and then rape
her that would be easier than convincing
her maybe someone they get somebody else
pregnant and then because pregnant ship
her off she'd have to get married
someone maybe by a woman was telling us
a mother was telling us her story about
her daughter her elder daughter they
took away and the younger daughter is
getting threats now and saying if you
don't come with us then we'll kill your
dad and your brother so really
disturbing things like that each one's a
different story we've shown a lot of the
stories in our film so
uh you know
other than your experiences of making
the film right now since the entire
controversy and the biggest one the
elephant in the room is that 32 000 has
come down to three
how did you reach the figure where you
decided to say that we are telling the
story of 30 000 plus women from Kerala
we were not telling the story of 32 000
we are telling the story of 50 000 or
more
we we reached to that particular number
32 000 with putting up a lot of a lot of
numerics and Mathematics and finally we
reached but today you know there is a
case was filed in Supreme Court then
tomorrow there will be Kerala high court
so we are not supposed to talk about the
breakdown of the number or the 30th of
the number but I can assure you till
yesterday the interviews we gave to the
place
quite large in a number
uh and from Tomorrow onwards whatever
interview will keep we will give the
breakdown of 32 000 and we will not shy
away our film so you can't buy that
figure so yeah we stand by that figure I
can I just interject here so where is
the confusion the confusion is that
there was a teaser in the month of
November where it talked about 32 000
girls now that teaser was a introduction
of the subject to the audience that is
not part of the film footage that is a
teaser that we shot outside the film to
introduce a subject through the story of
this one girl Shalini Krishnan we are
going to tell you the story that
happened to more than 32 000 girls that
is what the teaser says 32 000 converted
or radicalized uh so there is there is
this whole debate of converts and
radicalization we look at it as a
manipulative conversion
so she in the teaser says that this is
my story this is the story of 32 000
girls also but the film is about these
three girls in one film nobody can put
32 000 girl story it's impossible
so the film is about
the three girls who suffered but they
are representation they are representing
those 32 000 victims and as Dada said
that we stand by that number so there is
no confusion in our mind but because
some people want to discredit us
they have picked up these numbers and
they are picking up one word here one
word there and they are trying to say oh
first they were saying 32 000 now they
are saying three but we never said
it was always 32 000 in the teaser and
the film was about three girls and that
remains so what is the difference
between this 32 0003 just to clear the
air once and for all the difference is
that those 32 there are 32 000 stories
as she said that every girl has a
different story but largely the the
whole pattern and the outcome is almost
similar in all cases so you stand by the
figure that you have about 30 000 girls
who have been converted and of those the
three you are talking about their story
yes hundred percent but all of them
aren't necessarily Isis slaves or Isis
rights that is a separate issue yourself
yeah but we never claim that 32 000
girls are necessarily Isis Brides We are
saying 32 000 or more girls are missing
where have they gone what has happened
to them
is a subject of Investigation we are not
going to be able to find out where those
32 000 girls are so
so you know the chief minister of Kerala
he said that this state is a peace
loving State we are a secular State and
now you're trying to project it as some
kind of hotbed of fundamentalism
Etc is there a fear that you are here
tell me one thing when in 2010 uh 15th
of 12th of June
the then chief minister of Kerala Nandan
gave a statement in a press conference
in Delhi said that Kerala will be
converted into a Muslim Islamic State in
20 years that was not my data right it
was weird so children then said he was a
CPM chief minister and a patriarchy
now that time pinari began sir who is
now chief minister supported that
subject now you tell me
such a radical comment that Kerala will
be converted into Islamic State in 20
years don't you do you think that it is
any any without much support system
support based backing up his comment he
just said like that he did not he had a
complete thought process behind it
complete research behind it now
that is the tragedy of my country that
everything is boiled down to vote
so maybe there is a compulsion maybe
there is a political
that the politician are coming forward
to appease a particular Community but
again we are also not blaming any
Community we are only talking about the
terrorists so you want to name the
terrorist
you want to put a religion to the
terrorism is your problem it is not our
problem are you scared because you come
from Kerala that you know people will
look at you as Muslim hater islamophobe
no I think our friend clearly says we're
against terrorism so those who are not
supporting it and who are getting
another religion into it and saying it's
against Muslims they must be
islamophobic I definitely am not I'm not
against any religion and uh I'm why
would I be I'm very confident in my own
religion I wouldn't be insecure enough
to take down someone else's religion I'd
never do that I saw a lot of people on
Twitter actually who were tagging you
and saying that you belong to our state
but you are bringing it a bad name a lot
of actually handles from Kerala was
saying it but a lot of handles from
Kerala are really supporting us so many
girls who are putting pictures of before
and after of putting pictures and saying
thank you now you've started it now we
can come out with our story so many
messages a lot of support from Kerala
but yeah some people did say that again
they're judging it by a two-minute
teaser but I'm glad we have freedom of
speech in the country and everyone's
allowed to put their reasons there is a
there is this very funny thing about it
uh you know there is a film called
shootout at lokhandwala
now what they when you name a film
shootout at lokhandwara
yeah or Mumbai Saga which is which talks
about the underworld of Mumbai so are
you trying to say those filmmakers were
trying to malign Mumbai I was to make a
story on doubt
which religion or caste will I talk
about
will I be talking about a terrorist or a
Muslim
I will be taking him as a terrorist if
somebody wants to take him as a Muslim
that is their choice but see the
difference here is that you're also
talking about conversion you are saying
that Hindu girls Christian girls are
being turned into Muslims that's why the
religion angle comes in but again they
are see the point is that for us those
people who are doing this are terrorists
simple and straight it is we have no
confusion in our mind that who are they
and if somebody is a terrorist then he
doesn't have a religion that's what my
understanding is and that is why we are
very clear our film is not against the
state of Kerala our film is not any
Community or any religion it is only and
only against those villains who are
doing this terrible thing to these girls
simple a lot is being even connected to
the song and I see that you're wearing a
saffron uh
no yesterday I was in a green t-shirt
today yesterday I attended almost
our film telling the story of three
girls three real girl three real girl
with a real background one girl is right
now in a jail in Afghanistan Afghanistan
Iran Border
or her mother is in the next channel
everywhere so we can't say anything
wrong about that girl because her life
is under the rudder of a I mean I mean
our investigating agencies everybody we
told the story of a girl called
Aishwarya her parents
her parents were
they are everywhere they are talking
about they are talking about uh
the justice for their daughter
she's a real girl we are talking about
Nima Matthew Nima Matthew is a girl who
has been repeatedly raped just because
she refused to convert and now she's
she's underground nobody knows where is
she she came and talks spoke to her
spoke to our camera but now even I heard
that police is also not able to find her
so just tell me ma'am we are talking the
stories of three real girls and in
telling their story we just told that
the what process they went through why
she is right now in Afghanistan jail why
ah gitanjali is
committed suicide why Nima is in
hibernation that is the story
so here where we can fit any lie any
propaganda any politics this is the
story of three real girl if I tell the
story I get tears in my eyes when I when
I look at the eyes of gitanjali's
parents her mother is telling me
because
so do you think
tragedy the the worst genius strategy
is
shown every dialogue been spoken every
technical detail has been inculcated
into the film and we stand by that that
is our story beginning of our story end
of our story is the easiest thing to
discredit you that you say agenda nobody
has seen the film but it's a agenda
looking at the trailer how do I
challenge how do I con I fight with this
label it as agenda label it as well it
comes at a time suddenly when you have
the BJP in government they say Kashmir
but I think it is if if that is the
angle aren't you glad that we are now in
our position where we are able to say
these stories openly do you think
earlier this was deliberately kept Under
Wraps I won't say that because
ultimately filmmakers want to they go
ahead and make whatever why why are we
saying that
was a very different take on what
happened in godra and whatever
then the attack that comes on you the
viciousness of the attack it breaks your
heart
and today we are labeled as 2gs of
somebody some political party I it
doesn't bother me but it can bother
somebody we knew beforehand that this is
this kind of attack will happen on us
and we are okay with it we were mentally
prepared but somebody may not be able to
deal with it well he may not find it
right he'll say why the hell am I doing
this I think you'll be boycotted
I don't think so nobody is going to
boycott us if some group decides to
boycott this film well that's that's
their right as in the viciousness you're
talking about
you know that you will be sort of
labeled and sidelined is that the
thought not not from my industry I don't
think so my industry is mature enough to
deal with these things but yeah if
somebody wants to say that boycott this
filament don't go and see with this film
because into them we are some agents
that is also their right I just wish
that that right was more informed they
would at least see the film and give the
call
that's all
I find it bizarre speaking of bizarre
does it also seem strange to you that
there are actors in the recent past who
have
joined the cause she went to jnu
and she was hailed rightly so she wants
to associate with the cause you decide
to star in a film and you are being
called names you're being called
islamophobic bringing a bad name to
Kerala online you are speaking of how
you're also being subjected to abuse is
it disheartening or scary does it play
on your mind at all no actually it's
really heartening I did this film and I
didn't even think of what is going to
happen after we were like advocates for
these girls when we were filming it but
the amount of love and support you've
got from all across the world also not
just India and even online we're talking
about the trolling because we always
look at the bad comments and underline
that we're like oh this bad thing and we
scroll through all the good good we're
waiting waiting for this film and then
that one bad thing why are we doing that
shouldn't we read all the good ones
there's one bad tweet and understand
like 100 people who are saying how dare
you say this you've not even see the
film go this is my my screenshot of my
ticket so and and you know people have
seen uh some they did some screenings
for uh some people and those people are
sending in messages and like big
paragraphs from people so I think it's
very touching actually girls from Kerala
have been messaging me every day
thank you you've given us the voice so
far we couldn't speak but now we have a
voice and we are going to speak if you
can Empower those girls to this extent I
think
a large part of the films was is already
served
we just want the whole country to wake
up and say okay if this is happening
let's clean this mess that's all that's
all that we want if it is happening go
check for yourself if it is happening
help us to clean it simple
is about actually there's a girl who's
saying she got raped and they're asking
her prove it and she's saying I got
raped by 15 people and they're saying
but how can you prove it so it's exactly
it's exactly that it just feels like
how much inhuman can be because
you know it is so much so the the
agendas are so so so hard agendas are so
hard pushed that people forgot how to
how to celebrate a truth how to
celebrate a car the step like a Kerala
which is the highest number of educated
people which is UNESCO wise they have
the best possible women and child health
system and at the same time in a in a a
hindsight of that such heinous crime is
happening
prove us wrong by without trolling you
can like the way we convince the sensor
mode you convince government you
convince spoon is that nothing is
happening will be the happiest people
you think there's an agenda against your
film of course yes if somebody is some
some a group of people do not want to do
not want the truth to come out period
because it is an international agenda
because it is happening all over the
world and it is a Sinister plan that is
hazed against India
otherwise
will go to Delhi and say Kerala will be
turned into 20 years do you think he has
any agenda or he was meaning for meaning
to an agenda but you know here's the
thing why I again keep coming back to
that original figure is because there
can be cases where three women get
misled and they are you know taken
abroad and you know they join the Isis
Etc the problem that people are having
right now that it's being made to seem
as if wholesale are going from Kerala
you know hundreds and hundreds of them
are going out and the image of Kerala is
now being turned into one where every
third woman is a radical that is I think
what people are reacting to so if if
that is if that is what they are
reacting to there are enough and more
data available uh yesterday we were
talking to one Institute called Hindu
helpline
and that gentleman was on a video call
with us and he's saying that in their
organizations
their organization has dealt with 14
000 cases in last 10 years
14 000. of conversions of post
conversions manipulative conversion and
they have been able to save 8 500 girls
out of it he's saying with name and
every figure I will give data tell press
to contact me I will show them the data
so if somebody is talking about a number
as staggering as fourteen thousand arsha
Vidya samajam is claiming that they have
saved 6 000 cases in last seven eight
years
just 20 000 number between two
organizations
now we can debate
we can keep talking that's why I'm
saying and again our point is we have
got all these numbers but those those
numbers don't matter what matters is
that our daughters are our girls their
lives are getting destroyed
and if somebody doesn't agree with a
number of 32 000 and if he feels the
number is 28 000 or 25
000.
it's so insensitive to say 25 000 is not
enough
32 000.
I am giving you data of two
organizations and they are ready to come
and show you the proof yes but you you
keep talking about manipulative yes what
is that manipulative conversion is where
is it different from radicalization the
radicalization is the next step once you
manipulate a girl into believing in love
goodness and then you kind of trap her
converter once she's converted then the
situation is created where she's the
radicalization start
so our film talks about both
but the first phase is manipulative
conversion and lot of girls are now with
the awareness of whatever these two
organization and many more they are able
to save
so many girls from getting radicalized
do you think this is not forced
conversion or what is crudely known as
love Jihad this is mind games and
conversion absolutely
yes
exactly is the subject exactly we are
arguing we are we are discrediting the
argument and we are creating new
argument it's a beautiful film not
because it is our film actually this
film will open up your eyes that's
exactly what you asked us is step by
step shown uh in the film like it's a
step-by-step process so on how it is so
she starts by thinking that she is in
love which is why you're calling it and
you have to see how she doesn't genuine
yeah and she believes that the other
person is in also genuine love the only
thing is that's not true
and that's where things go wrong
see it's a very simple thing that one
girl gets shocked and her body parts are
in fridge right
forget the religion part of it the girl
genuinely loved the guy
but that didn't turn out to be a real
love story
right so speaking of love now I saw you
got a lot of love at jnu surprised
be excited to meet them because they
were you know the first youngsters who
saw our film we were very eager to see
how youngsters are reacting to it
particularly boys and young girls and
we were so thrilled to meet them and see
the reaction it was like Vindication of
everything that we worked for last three
years and he has worked for seven years
it was a Vindication of all of that so
much love so much support and we asked
them that you know what are you going to
do now he said we are going to ensure
that everybody around us is going to see
the film we want to drag them to see the
film because this film has to be seen by
everybody so we were like wow and this
is what we want from the film and
particularly if uh young mind is you
know connecting with the film in such a
way it's a terrific terrific feeling so
at least give a fair chance to listen
yes
absolutely you see the film if you don't
like tell us tell in the social media
that this film is bad I did not like it
you know that is that is an obvious
obvious outcry in in in genuine in in
different parts of India so that was
that was okay it's okay like uh they
were they were they were rooting for Ada
also they were shouting really cheering
her because she has actually did a great
job in the film so I think she got
Vindication of her hard work she
actually did her also sometimes when you
don't know how to express yourself in
words you go and Shout a slogan because
that's a release so when they saw us
they were so emotional that they started
screaming and that that scream turned
into a chant initially there was no
Bharat Mata Ki Jai or anything it was
when they early when they first time saw
they started screaming at top of their
voices
and then one guy started screaming
because I think it's a it was more
release of so many things that they
wanted to tell us of not being heard so
far perhaps no just the fact that they
wanted to share so much emotions stood
up and said such a wonderful thing about
one Professor the first reaction gave by
a I think international law
international law professor
she stood up she said this is exactly
what we are seeing I am seeing
throughout my research work but I was
not finding a way to
vent out my feelings first time I see
that you are giving Voice to my concern
about my Society I think that is enough
to you know congratulate us and and I'm
sure by day after tomorrow we will get
lot of such such Vindication and please
call us after that of course but do you
do you hope more of your colleagues
stand up
because whenever this kind of uh you
know coordinated attack happens on a
film
did you wish that more of your
colleagues would vocally stand up and
say please
all the people who really matter to me
have stood by me from the day I signed
it to now all my really close friends my
family and no one had even like an iota
of doubt in their mind of whether I
should do the film or not like when I
told my friends this is the subject and
they were like you have to do it and uh
no so the people who matter the most to
me have stood by me so so will this sort
of
you know raise the lid on certain issues
which were thought to be very touchy so
far in the Hindi film industry we've
seen quite a few films come out in the
recent past do you think that finally
those untold stories more such stories
especially any that you have in mind see
I think what's going to happen is that
there is one thing about selecting a
subject and the other thing is about
telling it with hundred percent honesty
and 100 boldness I think around it yeah
I mean there was there was a time where
people in in in films picked up subjects
but they were not able to you know go
100 bold or honest and then there was
some sugar coating here some sugar
monthly balancing business
I think this one will tell
no need for that
and that approach is what I think makes
this film special there is no sugar
coating and there is no name shaming
nothing we are just being honest and
true to the subject period tell me
honestly though in the Hindi film
industry
you know groups
foreign
see there could be some section again
who could feel
very strongly about their political
ideology versus somebody else's ideology
but that kind of people again exist
everywhere largely I feel we all are
okay with having completely different
ideology than you know contrasting
ideologies but at the end of the day we
are fine with each other we are friendly
with each other and we are
professionally fine we work together
without a problem
since you know this is the Kerala story
you are from Kerala what would you say
to the people in Kerala who are loving
you and those who are opposing you
uh so since I am from Kerala I think
edla is a beautiful place and uh We've
made Kerala look really beautiful in the
movie from the grass to the trees the
beaches and we've actually romanticized
made it look really beautiful however
Kerala might have some people that are
not so lovely and we've also shown that
that doesn't mean we dislike the entire
Caroline we're still saying Kerala is
really beautiful but maybe if you get
rid of these people who are not good for
Kerala who are ruining the entire
beautiful Kerala then you can have
Kerala be as beautiful because it
because of these people it might just
spread to the entire Kerala and then you
know so I think once people watch the
film they'll understand that our films
anti-terrorism and then they'll all be
on our side because they'll say oh these
guys were saying stuff against terrorism
not against any religion not against
Kerala and definitely not against you
have to see how beautiful like there
were shots that I saw and I was like Wow
of Catalan like it just looks we made it
look really really beautiful so we not
there's nothing derogatory against
Kerala or any religion so well you may
not completely agree with the film you
may love it you may dislike it but at
the very least you have to watch it
before making up your mind because
ultimately it is about the telling of
the story best of luck for the release
of your film uh hope that it does well
and we will speak to you after the
release thanks very much thanks very
much for joining us thank you thank you

Few groups have come to the fore and ...,2023-05-03T04:58:02Z,TIMES NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EM0QqHnXrB4/hqdefault.jpg,"as the lobby continues to demand for a
ban on the film The Kerala story
accusing it of propaganda against the
state the filmmakers have made it clear
that they will not back down film
director sudiptosen has said that they
claim that the meat that has been made
in the film that nearly 30 2 000 women
from Kerala that were radicalized and
apparently joined the Isis he says it is
factually correct now the number that he
says it is based on facts and the team
has the evidence for it
let me explain you
the 32 000 number
is an arbitrary number
now I will you have to listen and if you
write you have to write the truth
we have a mathematics of what the dead
chief minister Oman Chutney has said
about conversion in Kerala Kerala has
the only state in the country who has
official conversion Center which is I
don't know how ridiculous it could be
and they come out with the number of 900
girls being converted then in 2016 there
is no data of 2015. adding up and we
match up with Chief ministers you are
writing all these mathematics chief

3200 average 32
000 but the people

certification before an appropriate
Authority it said that the plea to stay
to the release of the movie cannot make
cloud with other instances of hate
speech The Plea against the film claimed
that the movie was the worst kind of
hate speech and complete audio visual
propaganda where the Kerala story is a
Hindi movie that is paid on the beam of
a religious conversion as the film that
is based on 21 people who went missing
back in 2016 and reportedly joined the
Islamic State
now with those details that continue to
come in there have been reactions and
criticism as well with the Kerala chief
minister who was a hit out at the makers
of the movie alleging that they were
pushing across a propaganda of the sank
parivar to project Kerala as a center of
religious extremism that the chief
minister has said that love Jihad that
was being used by the film only to
defame it and the sun was the one who
was trying to disturb the communal
Harmony in the state of Kerala by such
kind of propaganda that is being used
through this film
foreign
Crusaders of free speech had objected to
the film such as Kashmir 5 labeling it
at vulgar propaganda calling the release
of the film ADI production the
controversy over ravan's look and
calling it as an artistic expression
backed by the release of the BBC
documentary despite the government
putting a ban on it today the hypocrisy
that spans exposed once again not just
with the left government and Kerala but
the congress party that has also urged a
center to not give any screaming
permission to the film alleging that it
painted the Muslim Community in bad
light however there have been 10 scenes
from the movie that has already been
deleted or removed before its release
and it includes the entire interview
from the former Kerala chief minister
understood to have been via
sachutanandan that had claimed to
validate the filmmaker's claim listening
to the Congress charges well however the
film that has already been given a
certificate for clearance and that will
be released soon
foreign
also when it comes to the Jamaica which
has also moved the Supreme Court
opposing the film's release saying that
it gives an impression that the ordinary
Muslim youth are also involved in
radicalizing non-muslims meanwhile the
activists and the BJP have been claiming
that forced conversion is a reality
which no one can deny and the people
must be made aware of the truth
false conversions are a documented
reality that nobody can deny what
happened to nimisha Fatima Sonia
Sebastian Rafael Mariam are all part of
documented history and Collective
Consciousness so when somebody raises
that it cannot be branded as a part of
hate speech Yes the numbers 32 000 can
be debated but the honorable Supreme
Court rightly pointed out these cannot
be hate speeches and these are films
that need to be debated and discussed as

days it it has suspended the flight
operation but all of this has left the

there are they are in great distress
because yesterday Gophers issued a
statement saying that they will be
refunding the amount to the percentages

this they're facing inconvenience they
are saying that rather than giving back
the money the airline should have uh
arranged for them some alternative plan

book the flights for three times the

first Airline but this is the terminal
from where the go first Airline usually
takes off from the percentages are
facing a lot of problems the check

should be taken against them for
canceling the flight uh abruptly and

know that as many as 70 flights take off
to different locations and also uh to
Dubai as well as Thailand but all of
these flights will not be uh taking off
the and the government has taken a
serious view of it because the airline
has canceled these flights abruptly and
that is why ashoka's notice has been
issued to them all right because they
haven't informed the passengers yet and

are getting to know that the enforcement
directorate has conducted searches at
the premises of baiju ravindran who is
the CEO of the bengaluru-based education
Tech firm by juice for allegedly
violating foreign funding laws now there
has been at least two business and one
residential premises in Bengaluru that
has been searched by the probe agency in
connection with a case against Baidu
navrindran and his company think and
learn private limited under the
provisions of the Foreign Exchange
Management act now the other details
that we are getting to know as the
famous Searchers also revealed that the
company received for it directed
investment to the tune of around 28 000
crores approximately During the period
from 2011 to 2023 and the further the
company is also limited around
9754 crores approximately to various
foreign jurisdiction during the same
period in the name of overseas direct
investment so we have bhaktosh with us
right now by juice has been calling it
as a inquiry under FEMA what are the
allegations
well as far as concerned they are very
serious because enforcement has
registered it's under semi and they have
in fact pointed out that between after
2020 and 21 they have not carried out
any proper furnace audit they have also
pointed out the very fact that several
some severe issues to the CEO and
founder
and he did not cooperate and did not
join the investigation they have also
said that a foreign investment from 28
000 crores we received between 20 uh
2011 2023 and by juice in fact limited
around
9754 crore Rupees to overseas uh other
investigation by the Ed revealed that a
whopping 940 uh 944 rupees were spent on
uh advertisement and marketing uh part
of which was in fact even spent abroad
uh it is the investigation revealed that
there were several individuals both the
parents as well as people who were
associated with baijus who had lost
complete and their complaint has also
been taken on record uh remember Amita
they were in fact recent searches at the
carried out with the enforcement
directly both at the official official
premises of baijus as well as his
residence so I just continue to maintain
that they have not done any criminality
that their book of records and other a
legal documents are all in place and
they will cooperate with the enforcement
directly and other law enforcing agency
what is also being mentioned that around
the company uh which Edie says that it's
not prepared for its financial
statements since the financial year 2020
2021 and has also not gotten the
accounts edited or the audit are also
happening which is mandatory in this
case hence the genuineness of the
figures provided by the company are
being also crossed examined by the Banks
as well this is what the Ed has to come
out to save
veracity of their audit book is being
investigated their Book of Records is
being investigated their accounts are
being investigated so one can say that
by juice uh is a lot of trouble Edie has
registered under FEMA and this
investigation that has been carried out
with enforcement directly started a long
time back uh four months Edie was uh
investigating them and the fact that the
co-founder and CEO um well that's the
development coming in as the enforcement

good evening ladies and gentlemen time
networked operation sheesh Mahal has
jolted the high and mighty of delhi's
ruling dispensation today we are going
to show you how Mr kgwal didn't restrict
himself to the rupees 45 crore
renovation he in fact wanted to expand
the territory of his Raj Mahal by an
extra two and a half acres of land
violating rules and Norms yes ladies and
gentlemen I hold in my hand this survey
report that shows that this was the
complex that Mr arvind kejriwal wanted
to build this is the entire rajpur Road
there are two officials Flats here which
are for senior officials which were
asked to be vacated these two through
this order in April of 2022 and added in
this entire area where this side would
be a park with a foot path bees would be
Flats also eight Flats which were
demolished and two Bungalows which
clearly needed to be removed and they
were vacated possibly in the expansion
and of course this area includes a park
here a badminton court the cm's office
the cm's residence parking uh all kinds
of things in this entire CM complex and
this was the surveyors report which was
going to increase the area of this
entire complex from 4.74 acres to 7.2
Acres if you see the fine print written
here and those Graphics are on your
screen but this is the survey report it
would make you believe that arvind
kejriwal who flaunted his arm at me
image in front of cameras was building a
larger than life scalar Behind the Walls
of the chief Minister's compound if
spending rupees 15 lakh on vanity in
toilets wasn't enough just vanities
other fitting sanitary fittings and
other 12 lives the glass cubicles and
other 90 laps you know that's the kind
of expenditure in the 15 bathrooms the
15 bathrooms that were built in this
Mahal that was being made the sheesh
the apartment also said that they should
build a mansion but an entire complex
for the chief minister and this is the
story of transformation of a muffler man
into a Maharaja many people on the
streets are saying today times now has
access the site map blueprint that shows
how almost two Bungalows and eight Flats
on the flagstaff's road were vacated and
some raised to the ground some still
being looked at and the area increased
from 4.75 acres to 7.2 acres and this
was done to create Parks badminton
courts and what have you a mini Township
in itself senior government officers
were given notice to vacate their
official homes two notices were served
within a span of three months because
there was delay that was not being
tolerated
complex banana the first notice was sent
on 11th May 2021 the second note is
August 12 2021 take a look also at the
April uh notice that was sent to some of
these flat inhabitants but ladies and
gentlemen take a look on what's going on
in that area today
I'm currently standing near the
residence of Delhi uh chief minister
arvind kejriwal and as per our sources
his plan was not only to spend on
expensive marble and curtains but to
have an expansive area surrounding his
residence firstly let me show you I'm
currently standing outside the officer's
Flat 45-47 rajput Road Delhi uh which is
situated right behind cm's Camp office
and I request my camera person to come
just a little further and show that some
sort of construction and demolition work
is currently going on here to make way
for cm's area to be expanded uh now let
me give you a little perspective of
where we are currently at eyebrow cast
my camera person to zoom in so we
currently at uh the place which is right
behind cm's camp Camp office Delhi
government as you can see the houses of
is officers judges were directed to be
vacated so that cm's residents are the
area surrounding his residence and
office area could be expanded
and there are visuals that there were
CCTV cameras which have been uh disabled
so that nobody can know what's going on
inside but ladies and gentlemen this is
in stark contrast to what Mr kgwal had
said nine years ago listen in and don't

asked questions of the ahmadmi party
leaders who went to Jantar Mantra to

them listening they were pushed they
were shoved even the mic on which they
were seeking answers was taken away from
them
take a look at this sequence
foreign
come on
[Music]
questions not entertained Mike snatched
away
that is the democracy and that is the
accountability so the legitimate
question we are asking on the news Are
Tonight car CM has he betrayed the
ahmadmi that's the question and that's
the debate coming up on the other side
you're watching the NewsHour at night
debate number one on times now super
prime time
joining me on the debate tonight GBL
nursing a member of Parliament and
National spokesperson of the BJP
abhijitair Mitra senior fellow at the
ipcs Dr sumanshiraman political analyst
parvinder Singh Sethi political analyst
supports the ahmadni party Dr Sanjay jha
suspended Congress leader author and
Economist Dr Sanjay I want to ask you
tonight do you still think this is an
unfair agenda that is being carried out
it's a story that now develops from part
one of operation sheesh Mahal where we
showed you the documents and the
expenditure of 45 crores to the curtains
to the marble to the violation of the
tender to now this Chief Minister's
complex that will be uh you know two and
a half acres more than what it already
is all these Grand plans but when
questions are asked Mike taken away from
our report does no questions answered is
this how democracy thrives and this is
something the opposition must look
within itself when it raises the issue
of democracy in danger
you're on mute
Navigator good evening I have always
maintained that in public life one
should be understated when it comes to
your uh you know kind of your the way
you live uh politicians in our country
should be aware that what percent of
Indians own forty percent of the
national wealth so we are a highly
economically polarized and not just
socially uh you know kind of
segregationist in the way we are so
there are there are a lot of challenges
when you are in politics and I do agree
with the general Viewpoint of your
Channel or anybody else for that matter
to question any politician and arvind
kejriwal cannot be an exception to that
rule that you know ultimately you're
accountable because it's taxpayers money
now whether it's X crores or X lacks it
doesn't matter end of day it should be
transparent and more important it should
be justified now there is only one point
that I want to add here that what is
important is that the same yard stick
should apply across the board and I say
it as a congress supporter you know I do
believe that the Ahmad party has
electorally hurt the Congress the most
but I would like that at this point of
time I'm not going to make political
critical Capital out of it for the
simple reason navika that all political
parties at various times have been
guilty of extremely ostentatious
expenditure you'll you'll be aware of
lavish weddings happening and you know
nobody is even
shall we say a least bit concerned about
answering questions that I think they
already citizen of India
ought to be told what's going on so in
in simple terms I think arvind kejriwal
is basically in my opinion by from what
I heard on your program by saying that
he's been counseled by his friends
advisors and political colleagues to not
stay as a fancy you know Bungalow
whatever I think
message that
Within
politicians do is you know when you are
faced with the Calamity create an
opportunity so I think by saying that
he's not going to live in these houses
he's going to live in something smaller
more uh conservative less flamboyant and
obviously therefore you know Frugal he's
making a political statement where he
wants to convert this into a political
Arsenal and good luck to him because I
do believe that politicians today need
to be very accountable which is why when
I on your program if you remember you
know doctor normally you're very precise
with your words
foreign
you must have heard the statement that I
played at Caesar's wife has to be above
suspicion sure you know and and that was
the plank of his politics I'm only
asking you a direct question and I want
a short straight answer Dr
what has come out in public domain of 45
crores and and building because now two
and a half acres being added up may go
to 80 crore 70 crore 60 crores or even
100 crores nobody knows I'm asking you
for a man who set out to give a
different quality of politics to this
country
is it a dhoka yes or no uh navika I will
say this is bizarre and outrageous in
terms of expenditure uh I I know the the
cost of flats and apartments in Delhi
for a chief minister to live in such a
fancy place absolutely unjustified I
don't think anybody
foreign
foreign foreign
foreign
is this the height of hypocrisy number
one number two why is the ahmatmi party
not being transparent why are they not
answering the questions on what was the
need they say they say that the was
going to fall off because it was a weak
building we have spoken to the company
that has done this survey report and
they said they were only asked to do the
survey of uh aerial of this complex and
they have given and they were not asked
to do any
please I repeat any survey of the
structure of the house which was almost
about to fall down
and if there is no survey of that done
by this company should the hamadmi party
today not declare which is the company
which certified that this house was
going to fall down and that it needed
curtains worth a crore of rupees and
marble from Vietnam were three and a
half crores to support the roof on top
chibiya narasimara
uh good evening to you and all the
panelists navika I think uh the visuals
and the facts that you have put out in
these stories they actually they make
you speechless
here is a party here is a leader who had
come to power through the through the
power of agitation and claimed to have
uh claimed to be having all the virtues
of Simplicity and claim that we will end
this kind of VIP Raj in in politics and
today he represents the worst form of
VIP culture I think he possibly after
coming to par possibly he felt he was
like a Maharaja of Delhi because the
kind of visuals that you have shown the
curtains the Interiors the the carpets
this only maharajas in in Delhi uh or as
12 maharajas they might have something
like this it's not required for a
politically elected chief minister or
for anyone for that matter let me tell
you in a country where the prime
minister's own family his own mother
lived in a two-room house
few could have been easily given the
Prime Minister could have taken one
house in in gandhinagar
biggest Bangla could have been allotted
to him what prevents anyone from taking
it and his mother and his family they
take Public Services like any other Rama
so prime minister represents the real
Ahmadi then your uh
that is
it shocks and it pains and it pains
because you have somebody who's fooled
the entire country and who they did not
pinch him a bit let me tell you I live
in a garment accommodation as an MP and
uh you see my uh obviously five years
ago when I became an MP I moved into my
accommodation which also was built in
1950s and I can tell you in the last
five years I don't think they would have
spent even one lakh rupees on any work
in the house that I live with I can also
ask for several things every quarter and
get it approved because we are we have a
party in power get it approved by the
committee get your work done
but I have not spent even one lakh
rupees maybe less than 50 000.
the same the same argument for the last
four days prime minister has a bungalow
that is so big he has a plane that is so
big he has a denture hi we all know that
but you said you are going to be
different
everybody knew that the Prime Minister
had SPG
Rajiv Gandhi Rajiv Gandhi uh
everybody had the SPG after that
but you said you don't want you're a
chief minister you represent the ahmadmi
you represent the common man I I again
ask you sumansi Raman complex two and a
half acres extra justify Justified after
45 crores have already been on
renovation now now more expenditure
navika I would like you to put out the
breakup between the three different
constructions in this complex one is Mr
the Delhi Chief Minister's residence the
second is the quarters for his security
staff and the third is his office which
is being constructed within the complex
so if we put out the breakup then it the
numbers don't look so horrendously
outrageous and therefore we will not put
out the numbers we will also not I want
to I want to stop you right there if you
want to if you want to allege that there
is a bias on day one of operation
we gave the breakup of every clearance
including the 9.99 crore that was put
aside in the sanction for for the office
in his residence otherwise there is a
Secretariat which also has an office but
residence office was 9.99 crore but
expenditure there was only 8.11 crores
sanction 9.99 expenditure 8.1 but
macarana marble completely put aside and
Vietnam marble that is okay for the
residence party now you want to justify
this also and and blame me for putting
the story out in that manner by my take
you're not letting me speak if you
allege false things I will I will not
let you speak the breakup was given on
day one alleging no no
no no
what is the cost of the staff quarters
which is being built for a security
staff which is being built how do I know
then it will exceed exceed the
sanctioned amount please please no no no
in this 45 crore there is Staff quarters
for his personal security staff that is
being built please go and do the
homework maybe it doesn't look
attractive once all these things are
added up then 45 crore doesn't look so
huge oh man and also I'm sure navika
will be doing a show on the marble is
used in the today Mr Prem Shankar ja has
written a piece where he says that the
cost of the prime minister's residence
complex is 467 crore I don't know
whether it is right or wrong but that's
the article that Mr Prem Shankar Jah has
written today he says that the residence
complex not the central Vista comp just
the residence complex alone is to cost
467 crore one would not Grudge the Prime
Minister that because simply because
there would be quarters for the staff
there would be an office which is
attached to it and all that but this 45
crore if you look at it very carefully
is inclusive of all these things it is
not just a house and you are not willing
to sort of put all that information in
the public obviously you're a doctor
I think sometimes sometimes you miss the
point I think you think you are more of
a journalist than a doctor
I have the entire documentation here
nowhere none of the sanction maintains
anything about the staff quarters there
is one sanction only which is for the CM
residence office complex but that you
know you will come and throw you will
believe you will believe an article
written by Prem Shankar
my ex-boss as well but you will not
believe the documents that I am putting
right here you know in front of pure
National Television
so I want to no no I want to ask this
one
Dr Suman C Rahman points at me
virtually saying that I'm biased in the
facts that I show I want to ask you is
he being biased by trying to muddy the
muddy the water without without having
the real documents I'm adjusting any
whatever I'm asking simple questions I'm
telling you I'm telling you there are no
staff quarter expenditures here that
will be 45 crore plus plus
the floor is yours
not at all uh second you see with the
first thing we need to remember is there
is no official residence the chief
minister of Delhi remember Sheila
dikshit had a house allocated to her I
think to db15 or ab17 something like
that on mathura road opposite pragati
maidan
and you know uh uh uh uh
kurana who is the chief minister before
that had a different Bangla
these expenditures are not public
expenditures we don't even know who's
going to inherit this particular Bangla
after Mr kg one is gone if he is God at
all
right so let's be clear when you say
official expenditure what is the
expenditure of the Prime Minister the
residence is just that on the Prime
Minister official residence handed over
from prime minister to prime minister uh
in the rare exception where you know the
Gandhi's decide that they're so
important that it will be turned into a
National Monument to them which has
happened twice on public property and a
complete waste of public profit
uh the second issue here is you know 45
crores is a huge stretch by any stretch
of the imagination I I too have been
through the uh uh costing there is a
difference for the camp office the
so-called Camp office and the residence
uh there is no there is exactly zero
costing for the uh uh service quarters
or anything like that if you look at the
imagery from the satellites there are no
service quarters particularly to be seen
except the servants quarters and things
like that
there third remember I've done a long
trade on this so I'm not going to go
into it again 467 crores for the PLS
resident is a completely different
you're talking about a chief minister of
a puny Little City
square kilometers at best against a
prime minister of 1.4 billion of a
nuclear power zamina
now assume there is a very legitimate
thing to say that he needs a plane and a
helicopter and mind you there have been
accusations against him of misusing the
Punjab government plane and the Punjab
government helicopter against kg1 but he
needs to fly so you know the helicopter
I think is a very legitimate expense not
to be quit
the problem here is this isn't even a
governmental expense on an official
house
tomorrow this could go to absolutely
anyone Under the Sun and now what you
are showing me for another two two and a
half three acres this is actually going
to be bigger than any allocation to a
cabinet minister of India
the biggest cabinet ministers banglades
are about three 3.5 Acres the houses are
tiny by the way you're a type 8
accommodation for a senior cabinet
minister is something like about uh 2
800 square feet or something like that
at best right and the acreage is about
three and a half hours or so this one is
going up to seven acres with God knows
what not badminton the next thing you
know they'll be
so I really don't understand all this
sort of you know uh uh a goal post
shifting and what about me he also did
this she also did this the only other
official residence that we have right
now is I think kcr in Telangana and
probably there'll be one in the new
capital of Andhra whatever it is uh but
most Chief ministers just don't have
unlike the Raj Bhavan which is an
Institutional Handover they simply no
institutional Handover of any kind of
Chief Minister's house as far as I go
anywhere in this country
well that's the question or
[Music]
foreign foreign
thank you
is that argument something that you can
actually accept as an argument
let me be very honest with you I believe
one of the positive aspects of this
conversation is that no politician in
this country I'm glad gvl has publicly
talked about the fact that he's not
spent anything on his apartment I
believe no politician in this country
should actually be living the kind of
Life they do and I'm a big Advocate that
at latim's Delhi is Prime real estate
property and I'm a big advocate of the
fact that tomorrow India should actually
contemplate moving the capital away from
Delhi to some other part of India and
let's get into the abstract so that we
don't have to talk about the specific
question and go into what about tree
is this a demonstration of not answering
the question at hand but giving some uh
you know great Direction and great
philosophy
obviously navigation to our point you
then uh you know this is classic shop in
our 88 ways of defeating your
opportunity we learned all of this in
class 11 and you don't have the
specifics you go after the abstraction
but you know there is one important
point that Sanjay raised I think he's
mistaken please correct me if I am wrong
but did you say that kgwal has refused
to occupy the residence I think the
video that navika played was for nine
years back when the controversy arose
about it not right now as I understand
it he's very much in the residence
today one minute you need to have a
common measure to look at politicians
what they occupy the lifestyle okay so
common measure for politicians but you
should definitely not go by the promises
that they make to get into politics that
is the advisory now coming from those
who cannot defend this extravagance uh
compared with what was promised
convenient exit routes
can I make a quick point
get a loss to understand why there are
so many apologies for the for for the
indiscretions if I may use a very milder
word uh in Discretions by arvind
kejriwal I think what he has done is is
completely unacceptable and if it is
right if it is transparent then why was
it not above board why was the
transparency not shown to the public and
why are no answers coming to the
specific questions that are being raised
we'll continue to ask those questions
whether our reporters are shooed away
their minds taken we will still continue
to ask those questions

right so the 34th witness concerned
hostile today now the witness is
connected to many of the accused in the
case in fact the witness was connected
to many of the primers used in the case
including Colonel Rohit as well as he is
a doctor in the case in fact the
allegation or rather the witness
statement that he had given before the
ATS was that he was present in many of
the conspiracy meetings and there was a
plan to uh you know kill Muslims Visa of
the words that he had used at that time
by Colonel purohit as well
the statement he had given before the
eighties which he denied when he gave
the statement before the ni now today
before the court he denied any
statements given to ATS or the ni he
denied having known any of the accused
including pragya and Colonel purohit he
denied having given any statement under
uh 164. he said his voice samples were
taken but he did not attend any of the
conspiracy meetings and he was not aware
of any of these accused is what he said
before the court because his statement
before the atheist is extremely
important because if he had made a
certain big revolutions and and then he
went on to tell the Nia that this was
done under duress and Under Pressure so
clearly atheists case of weakened up 34
Witnesses have turned hostile now there
are hardly about four to five witnesses
left in the case to be examined and the
verdict could come anytime soon right
he's also denied statements that he had
made under 164 tell us the significance
of that radhika
that said he had you know made a certain
statements under 164 as well which he
denied now to take you through the
statements that he had made under 164 as
well he had said that I'm just going to
read out some portions of the statement
in fact he had said recorded both the
witnesses have stated that they attended
meeting held at Bhopal in the month of
April 2008 in the meeting uh Prasad
purohit explained about Jihadi
activities in Aurangabad and Malaga in
detail and appeal to others right so
something for its prevention and he also
said that preparation of Guerrilla war
was on so these are some of the
statements he had made before the
atheist which he denied there were
certain statements which he made before
ni is right this has already known some
of the accused and this case has been a
crumbling bit by bit Witness by witness
this change that it has taken in course

area that they wanted to incorporate as
we have been telling our viewers it was
earlier merely
4.73 Acres from there they now want to
increase entire space to 7.2 Acres
and two do this to bring in 7.2 Acres
this is the entire area on a Google map
this is where the chief Minister's
current residences this is what roughly
translates to around 4.73 Acres what
they however want to do is increase it
to 7.2 Acres close to double the entire
space instead of having this area they
have now asked eight separate Flats as
well as two Bungalows to be vacated in
this entire area so that the entire

China said ...,2023-04-28T07:30:45Z,TIMES NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6No5Zh0npj8/hqdefault.jpg,"of course is in retaliation to the
raksha mantri's comments in the latest
now China responding essentially to the
statement that was made by defense
minister rajnath Singh on the Lac
situation China now comes out to say
that the Border situation remains stable
and we must jointly contribute to peace
to put the story in perspective viewers
let me quickly remind you how defense
minister rajnath Singh has raised the
issue of the lingering border
controversy with China and Eastern
ladakh and this with his Chinese
counterpart he stressed that the
violation of existing agreements had
eroded bilateral relations and the
development of India China ties was
based on the prevalence of peace and
Tranquility at the border and all
important message sent out by the
rakshatri to which China has now
responded as well rishab joining us with
that detailed response rishabh so what
we know that both the higher defense
ministers met yesterday here in national
capital on the sidelines of now ongoing
SEO defense minister Summit and the way
both the ministers discussed as India
has kept it uh an open uh you know a
fact that India China nation is not
normal and same uh the defense minister
stayed on that line and said that India
believed that a peace and Tranquility on
Lac is something which is in benefit of
both the countries and now you know
statement of the Chinese defense
minister has also come in and he says
that he at the China India discussion he
says that things are stable on the
borders while India's favorite situation
is not normal quote unquote uh you know
China says everything is normal this is
something that China has maintained even
after 1962 or 1968 uh conflict with
India they said that things are normal
and everything is as before
but things were not that China's
expansionist policies continued even the
462 68 and 72 so now uh you know China
coming up with this statement while
India says that things are not normal
and things will only be normal once the
deployment on both sides of loc will
decrease as of now that is not the case
all right but on the contrary you have
the Chinese State councilor responding
essentially to what the raksha mantri
has stated but it's problematic in
itself Russia because on one hand you
have the raksha mantri state in as many
words that until and unless the Border
situation is uh cleared out it's not
going to do any good as far as both the
countries are concerned the relationship
their share the relationship they share
goes but here you have his counterpart
urging to bring the Border situation
under normalized management to jointly
enhance Mutual trust between the two
armies so on the surface of it the
Chinese are trolley trying to send out
the message it's not going to really
hold any Merit because the raksha mantri
has stated in as many words bring peace
and Tranquility else it's pointless to
come out with these empty promises
definitely what is peace and Tranquility
on LST India is very clear decrease the
number of forces decrease the number of
settlements that you have made uh in and
around Lac return back to the agreed
border marking and that will be the
peace and Tranquility which is not the
case and we have seen huge uh deployment
of a Chinese Army in both Leviton and
Eastern sector because sector we have
seen Simon against the provocation from
Chinese side and the creation of
villages or be it in Bhutan uh territory
or be it and you know uh close to Indian
border and that is something that
provokes the relationship between India
and China and India that's why it's very
clear that if you want peace and
regularity bring Tranquility remove the
forces that you have put in well how
seriously will India now see this with
China saying that we must jointly
contribute to peace because India are
very very firm on how it has moved
towards that particular contribution

contradictions as part of operation

contradiction is about the nature of
work being carried out on the chief
Minister's residential premises before
we get you this fresh set of documents
to underline the contradictions and
perhaps the outright obfuscations that
were done officially to keep you the
taxpayer
has told us repeatedly that a new
residence not a renovation a new
residence had to be constructed because
the one in which Mr kejriwal was living
was practically falling apart first
listening to what the Ahmad party's
defense was on day one when we came out
with operation sheesh Mahal and then the
story will unravel further this is the
notice inviting tender and here let's
point out to you the language that has
been used the name of work very clearly
says the name of work is addition
alteration in Residence of honorable
chief minister at Six Flags staff wrote
civil lines Delhi during 2021.
providing additional accommodation civil
and electrical works
the second contradiction remember that
the house is covered in imported marble
the work order with times now and this
is where we had pointed out the kind of
marble that was used pictures that were
available from inside the chief
Minister's residence you can see the
marble the Dior Pearl marble that was
put inside Mr casual this is not a
representative image this is an actual
picture from a few days ago when nitish
Kumar had come to meet Mr kejriwal
raghav chadda San Jose also present and
here you can see by the way not just the
marble but you can also see perhaps one
of those Rich hand tufted wool carpets
but this viewers is the Dior marble was
this the one that was supposed to be
ordered the work order with times now
suggests that as per the direction of
the chief engineer in charge
there was quite another kind of marble
which was cleared for use
makrana White marble should not be less
than 700 rupees per square feet as
verified and approved by the engineer in
charge here it says as verified and
approved by the engineer in charge
makrana White marble should not be less
than 700 per square feet
what was it eventually per square meter
part mean not per square feet it was
eventually per square meter it says over
here 750 rupees per square meter which
means that if this makrana marble had
been used the overall costing would have
been about 82 lakhs 14
450. keep this figure in mind this is
the operative figure had this makrana
been used as was cleared by the engineer
in Chief the costing would have been a
pretty reasonable not Frugal but still
pretty reasonable because who gave the
clearance to go ahead with a much more
expensive Vietnamese marble which is
called the Dior Pearl marble contractors

Mystery of the Magnificent marble in

nothing else available was the use of
this marble advised for some special

this marble can be used for the chief

should be bought and that has been
approved by the engineer in charge
contrary to this advice
what was bought was Dior Pearl marble at
a cost of 11 000 rupees per square feet
750 rupees per square feet 11 000 rupees
per square feet more than 10 times the
amount that was approved
added to this was the cost of polishing
the Dior marble as a result the same
beautification the same marble flooring
that could have been done with makarana
marble at a total cost of 82 lakh rupees
was eventually completed at a cost of
3.33 crores
do the math
this alone was an escalation of 1500
percent over what was approved
mind you the makrana marble that was
advised by the engineering Chief has
been used to build the Taj Mahal what
you see on your screen right now are
actual grabs of the makrana marble we
went we searched for it that is the
makrana marble on your left on your
right is the Pearl Dior marble frankly
for a lay person I don't see what is the
great difference
then what was the crushing need
to get a marble that is a thousand five
hundred times more expensive is the
makrana marble from Rajasthan is good
enough for Taj Mahal why isn't it good
enough
for Mr kejriwal's sheesh",True,en,3990,20,52

While addressing a public rally in ...,2023-04-27T11:57:58Z,TIMES NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UNtXOuoDD1Y/hqdefault.jpg,"on the phone line right now is sanket
yenagi from the congress party so what
is your first reaction to do this kind
of language being used by Malik Arjun
karke
was referring to the ideology which Mr
Narendra Modi is following and he
belongs to Naran and that is what he is
making a remark on the ideology number
one okay what is the ideology that he's
referring to sir
so he is talking about the ideology
which with Mr Modi is referring to and
following up
that I think he has said in the
conversation which or the point of
speech which you have played now
yes I get that I was asking the context
which is why I'm asking to understand
if you want my own opinion you may have
to allow me to have my stay up the
opinion if you want to put your opinion
in my mouth I will not be doing this
what is that you want to please let us
know first whether you want my opinion
or your opinion more sir I just want
facts I want yes yes yeah when a prime
minister
in a parliament can make a reference or
a jive against the former prime minister
and saying wearing a raincoat and taking
a bath in the bathroom and that is
justifiable and appreciated by all the
section of the media and then it is
wrong according to the same media so
there must be some valid test for
everything if this is wrong that was
also wrong if that was wrong why it was
not opposed very very valid uh argument
coming from your side let me get shahzad
punawala of the BJP to answer that for
you Shazad
so yeah this is not a syog this is a
vote Bank a prayer before Gujarat
elections they abused the Prime Minister
his samaj they've abused his obesity
they've called himasur to Chai base
they've abused his parents
and now before Karnataka elections
perhaps saw the wood Bank considerations
they are again abusing him and his samaj
the fact that he comes from a poor
background and this is nothing new this
is the congress's this is the congress's
worst form of Politics the only question
is that from top to bottom every
Congress leader gets promoted and
rewarded for saying these kinds of
things and therefore you never really
find any action being taken on any
Congress leader did they take action on
the person Sheikh Hussain who said
[Music]
did they take action on us
did they take action on those who
chanted
did they take action on Priyanka said
Niche and targeted his background his
OBC did they take action
and now yet again they have abused Modi
and this is not seen the context of
Karnataka elections also Mr said
CMS are corrupt he has abused lingards
now Mr khadge and the Congress has
abused the OBC samaj so you can see that
there is
Rahul Gandhi says that he has opened
mohabbat Ki Dukan is this is
okay we seem to have lost that line but
the sanket there was pointing out that
why are you only highlighting when we
say such things a prime minister himself
has said objectionable statements about
Manmohan Singh is what he was referring
to
ever about Manmohan Singh because if
that statement has been made about
saying in that statement you should show
where Mr Manmohan Singh's name has been
taken
prime minister may have made a comment
about General situation but he has never
named Manmohan Singh and if Mr Yanagi is
so confident or Mr jairam is so
confident they should show us where the
name has been taken but your name is
being taken and is being said
name is being taken and said Modi is a
poisonous snake
so this kind of targeted commentary on
Modi Modi samaj on obc's it shows the
mindset of the congress party and the
congress party Justified that it is a
strategy of Congress to use this kind of
language before every election writer
thank you for joining us with your
inputs my colleague Deepak also joins us
on the broadcast tell us the context in
which these statements were made by
Malik Arjun
well basically he's telling the people
are not to trust in the Prime Minister
uh he's saying that the people gave him
a chance uh you know once and they've
thought that you know it is going to be
good for uh he says that you know
clearly everything that their Vision
their thought process their ideology has
shown over time is that it's bad for the
people that's the context in which he's
trying to speak uh
because we've got one of the
stakeholders in the state jds's leader
your first response
Karnataka is really a matured Place
Karnataka always really believes in
politics basis of issues
this kind of statement from such a
senior leader like Mr Malik is totally
uncalled for we all know the damage what
manishankar air had done uh in the past
by calling uh Modi chaiwala so and and
last time the Rahul Gandhi resorted to
that chaukidar
and stuff like that I think Congress
definitely need to really uh wake up
from their Slumber dream uh to fight
Karnataka election on basis of uh
uh issues by doing this they are
actually uh managing our chances also
Narendra Modi and people like him and
their troll media would always look out
for these and this would definitely give
an upper Edge so my grandfather said my
father agreed and I also agree that
nobody can defeat Congress but Congress
Israel care is enough to defeat itself I
think Malika region is a senior leader
should definitely fight uh election
basis of issues not on rhetorics right
madhav it is really bad State of Affairs
when even former allies and those who
are in opposition of the BJP are saying
that by making such utterances Congress
is scuttling its own prospects
madhav
you have a situation where other
opposition parties actually criticizing
the congress party for this kind of a
statement but if you go by past
experience whether BJP and the Prime
Minister have managed to turn adversity
into opportunity where they have managed
to turn disparaging remarks into remarks
to actually you know end up creating
sympathy for them then perhaps one
should not be surprised uh the example
of manishankar Ayers remark which was
just referred to by a tanveer is
something that is very clearly uh in the
memory of uh several and clearly what
the BJP will do from here on how they
will be able to utilize these kind of
statements and how they capitalize on it
is something that remains to be seen the
Prime Minister has time and again said
that he has you know uh drunk the poison
of all of these gullies and it only
makes him stronger that's the kind of
statement that he has said in the past
so perhaps this time around once again
this kind of a statement is only uh
perhaps going to enthuse the BJP and
bring them together in attacking
opposition particular leaders
particularly Mr kharge given the fact
that this is not the first time that he
has made a direct attack on the Prime
Minister uh using terms which many would
say perhaps are a little uh uh not
complementary for someone of his agents
teacher right Deepak in fact the bjb is
already coming out to say that it shows
the desperation of a party that knows
that it is losing and which is why
resorting to such statements
well you can definitely expect a lot of
sharp criticism because we've seen like
mother was mentioning when the chaiwala
statement came in you know the BJP was
very quick to pounce on it we've seen
other statements from Malik himself
against the Prime Minister this is now a
pole bound State and uh you know being
an aicc president taking on the Prime
Minister himself who's being projected
as the face of this particular Karnataka
BJP campaign calling him a venomous
snake is not going to go down too well
and they're going to capitalize on this
particular statement we'll have to see
what sort of rebuttals really come in we
are expecting a press conference to be
held by the BJP over the statement
itself in a short while from now right
uh let's before moving on once again for
our viewers play out that statement from
[Music]
I don't
know
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
s that have been made by him the court
in their verdict said when the Congress
was arguing that this is an a
disproportionate uh okay I'm being told
BJP is reacting to this let's listen in
thank you
right there you heard of BJP leader will
try and hold a reaction for you that was
uh but mother the point I was making was
that even when pronouncing the verdict
in Rahul Gandhi's case the court had
said that when you are in such a
responsible public position what you say
has a many a much larger impact than if
it was said by a common person
happens to be the president of congress
party and yet no change in the tone and
tenor of his utterances despite those
verdicts
well uh you know one very important
thing you have to remember and we were
referring to the kind of statements
before we go on to Mr Rahul Gandhi's own
utterances is what has been stated by Mr
kargay from ravan
these are the kind of controversial
statements that have been given by the
uh the president of the congress party
and he was the Congress president at
that time as well during the Gujarat
polls when he took on the Prime Minister
and that was of course the prime
minister's own home turf where he
managed to turn the tables around while
Mr kharge may think that he is of course
one of the tallest leaders here in
Karnataka and that uh this kind of uh
rhetoric or this kind of language may
find some kind of connect with people
the point is that when it comes to you
know electoral politics why do we see
political leaders coming out and making
these kind of comments which many would
consider normally completely unpalatable
one can certainly have differences and
attacks should certainly be there but
our comparisons with uh you know a
poisonous snake really something that
should be part Focus as far as a
politics is concerned what action will
the bgp take from here on will they just
fight it out politically will they be
formally complaining as far as the kind
of language that has been used with the
election commission what do they do from
here on is completely up to the BJP we
will have to see how they take up this
issue but one thing is for sure that
mind you this kind of a statement coming
in uh is something that can actually uh
you know pretty much become one of the
key issues as far as a political
campaign is concerned and judging by the
past judging by what has happened in the
past as far as the BJP itself is
concerned managing to turn the discourse
around by gandering Sympathy For Itself
uh in uh return for the kind of Gali
politics that they came coming from
various opposition leaders clearly the
BJP in the past has uh been seen uh you
know getting a fair amount of success in
actually doing that and we've given you
examples there have been examples for
instance of management and his chaiwala
remark or even the chocolate remark that
was made by Rahul Gandhi in the after
run up to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls which
was once again turned around by the BJP
and by the prime minister with the kind
of clever turn of phrase and rhetoric
now will that happen in this particular
case that's something that we need to
watch out for right Deepak in fact we
spoke to jds's tanvi remembered earlier
and somebody who's been a former Ally of
the Congress also says that this is
going to probably prove to be suicidal
to congress's political prospects
well wasn't able to uh hear you clearly
there but uh you know we've seen Mr
kharge earlier as well you know draw
parallels between um you know Lanka and
you know you know prime minister uh so
many other statements have come in the
past so uh you know while uh there is a
heated political battle here in
Karnataka name calling is that the way
forward is the question uh he could have
made his point uh without you know use
using such a terms as well but the
Congress feels that uh of This Is How
They want to really attack the Prime
Minister try to register uh you know
what the point that they're trying to
make among the waters through uh you
know these sort of words uh the choice
of words of course is something that
really comes into the question here and
like we've been saying the sharp
criticism from the BJP is expected but
how will they really up the ante here is
the question will they move uh the
election commission over this particular
statement will they seek an apology oh
well these are developments that are
expected over the next couple of hours
as the BJP is already all prepared uh to
hit out at the congress party see
President himself now Deepak the
clarification from the comrades suggests
that it was not intended for Prime
Minister Modi that what Mr third year
meant was only BJ
Airport
s
well as of now the audio there is pretty
clear and you know he's going on to say
that you know the ideology the thought
process the vision of the BJP he does
say but then he also says you know other
prime minister was given a chance
thinking uh yeah he's non-avenous where
people are probably the idea that he was
trying to put forth is that the people
believed in him uh but while they have
believed in him now they realize that
he's a venomous snake so this is uh you
know somewhere a metaphor sort of you
know statement that he's really made
here so it's going to be interesting uh
the BJP in the past we've seen they've
moved quotes they filed complaints
they've gone to the election commission
here you know it being a pole bound
State the election commission is
probably the first place that they'll go
to that's expected to happen and also
we've seen some sort of statements come
in from other Congress leaders uh blend
them in real big trouble so whether this
will call for any such trouble for you
know Malik Arjun kargay is something
that remains to be seen and in the",True,en,15680,257,122

process that a statutory body
set up by an act of parliament was
misled for 45 days on the nature and
scope of work that its sanctioned which
is imperative was sought only after
construction had been costs were kept
under a cut-off limit deliberately so
that permissions of the top brass of the
Delhi government's own officers did not
have to be taken so that tenders did not
have to be floated to requisition work
over the next 30 minutes we will break

exactly how each of these steps have

were not taken how a deliberate jugglery

let's take you to the first
and show you how the clearance of the

document one is a minutes of the meeting
of the Delhi Urban Arts commission which
we'll call the doac from here on this by
the way is the nodal body the minutes of
the meeting that we are getting to you
are from the 6th of November 2020 and it
says
it is mentioned in the project details
that the site work has already commenced
the site work has already commenced what
is the date of this particular meeting
6th of November
2020. at that time the doac says that
the site work has already commenced the
construction can only commence after
approval the question then is how did
the work start on the house of the chief
minister without the doac not even
giving its approval the approval came
much much later the second
paper that we are going to show you now
is of the same meeting another
observation was made which shows how the
statutory body was misled how
in the minutes of meeting from the 6th
of November 2020 it is said as per the
subject proposal is for additions and
alterations however it's clearly evident
that an entirely new building is
proposed by demolishing the existing
structure this needs clarification the
third document will reveal how a month
later the initial plan was not approved
we're talking about the 11th of December
2020. now from this day here you see the
11th of December 2020 the minutes of
meeting from that day say and I quote
commission did not approve the building
plan proposal specific observations
given why didn't the ahmadni party
government clarify to the panel as asked
about misleading them that's the next
question that needs to be asked now
let's come to point number three and for
this we will go to the fourth document
which is from the 18th of December 2020.
what do you get to know over here that
it is only on the 18th of December 2020
that a revised proposal was given and
the entire proposal was approved first
of September 2020 they had already

good evening ladies and gentlemen
yesterday on times now navbharat we
exposed how a whopping rupees 45 crore
taxpayers money was pledged on the
renovation and purification of Delhi
chief minister arvind tejiwal 6
Flagstaff road Bungalow the arm aadmi
today clearly is asking questions they
are ranked
and why not
absolutely justified in being angry and
raising questions they Place their trust
and faith in the ahmadmi party but what
did they get in return
because all the claims today have turned
out to be fake promises all money spent
on building a palace for a chief
minister who promised it unconditionally
that he would be honest and loyal to the
arm at me
this exposing ladies and gentlemen just
keeps getting bigger and bigger tonight
on the NewsHour we will show you how the
Delhi chief minister betrayed the
ahmadni and this was all carried out
with an utter disregard to rules and
regulations a statutory body the Delhi
Urban Arts commission which was set up
by an act of parliament was first misled
for 45 days on the nature and scope of
work carried out inside the chief
Minister's Bungalow its sanction was
only sought after construction had
already begun and this is something that
is noted in the minutes of the meeting
of the duac not just this even the costs
were kept under a cut-off limit below
rupees 10 crore because according to the
General Financial rules any amount spent
by the PWD department or any Department
which was under the 10 crore value could
be just okay made by departmental heads
without even going to senior officials
no permission required of any senior
official so the entire bureaucracy had
no idea what was going on
let me now show you one by one how the
Delhi Chief ministers residence
beautification flouted these rules for
the ridiculous splurge on his Mansion
the first document is a minutes of the
meeting of the Delhi Urban Arts
commission from 6 November 2020 and as I
said in an eye course it is mentioned in
the project details that the site work
has already commenced construction can
only commence after approval the
question then is how did the work start
at least 60 days before approval because
the first sanction of 7.92 crores came
on the 1st of September 2020.
clearance being sought in November when
construction is already on at least 60
days in advance in the same meeting
another observation was made that shows
how the statutory body was misled it
says as per the subject proposal is for
additions and alterations and that's
what every document of sanction shows
editions and alterations nowhere does it
show that it is a reconstruction and the
minutes not that however it's clearly
evident that an entirely new building is
proposed by demolishing the existing
structure this needs clarification
that's what the statutory body said the
document that I have in my hand reveals
that
that is sitting that is on the 11th of
December 2020 the commission had not
given approval to the building plan
proposal and specific observations were
given then to the Delhi government
the fourth document shows that it was
only on 18th December 2020 when the duac
gave its approval the revised proposal
was approved with observations the
question then is why did ahmadini party
approach the total body for sanction 50
days after the work had already begun
post facto why
now we show you how on the 1st of
September 2020 that is 100 days before
the doac approval
8 crores or 7.91 crores were sanctioned
by the state for additions and
alterations in the additional
accommodation in the chief Minister's
resident it said construction cost of
rupees 7 crore 91 lakhs
19400 has been approved
how was the construction taking place
what about rules remember ladies and
gentlemen the funds were sanctioned in
at least six tranches for the
construction of the chief Minister's
residence what's interesting to note is
that all costs were kept under 10 crores
the first sanction for 7.92 crore the
second for 1.64 crore the third for nine
points 2.09 crore
10 crore
this was cleverly done to escape the
tender root of so we understand because
that's what the GFR the government
financial rules indicate that below 10
crore just signed by the chief engineer
and move ahead so was it to bypass the
tender procedures which is why which is
the known Norm for government uh
procurement the office memorandum of
Delhi government's finance department of
2019 August says that rupees 10 crore
the power is rested with the hod the
head of Department to sanction these
expenses hence the approval of
secretaries was not even required so the
apps are car in a very clever manner
managed to bypass the rules no tender
had to be floated and the PWD Securities
were also kept completely out of the
loop
ladies and gentlemen that really becomes
the issue yesterday it was about
propriety today it is flouting the rules
to benefit home
is the same Mr arvind kejriwal who once
slammed the then chief minister of Delhi
Sheila Dixit for allegedly having 10 air
conditioners in her home a classic case
of pot calling the kettle black
listening to arvind kejriwal's charge
and that is the interview I did in
Sheila dixit's house
when she was chief minister
not half as ostentatious as what these
bills really show what was Mr arvind
kejawal talking about listening
[Applause]
meanwhile even as the ahmadmi party
tried to justify the extravagance the
ship he has asked as to why did the aam
aadmi party hide it all from the aamadi
that's the question the PJP history
and that brings me ladies and gentlemen
to the legitimate question we are asking
on the news
why was me kept in the dark why was the
entire system kept in the doubt
what were they trying to do it's a
legitimate question that we are asking
questions and joining me on the debate
on the other side is that debate where
we are asking this question
joining me tonight nalin Kohli National

also a good South Indian cook I presume
because he keeps questioning my cooking
skills ashutosh senior journalist hura

Economist what have you I want to first
ask my question of Huda sarivala who
does hariwala why was every single
sanction below 10 crore Rupees yesterday
we only questioned the propriety today
the question is were you bypassing
a certain decorum and rules that are
there I'm coming to you Doctor
I would never ever do this you know it
but I just want one question and
statement to Zari my good friend can I
please do it I would never ever do it
please I beg off you you know you always
have my Indulgence no thank you so much
I I want to make a disclosure here
before zariji can begin and the
disclosure is I promise to put 15 lakhs
into the account of Zari Huda Balaji if
she goes about her two minutes giving
her explanation without resorting to
either Modi BJP or what about tree 50
lakhs directly into her account
you have an incentive to give a straight
answer to the direct questions that are
asked
well that just goes on to show that um
you know I am blessed with Rich friends
like Dr ranganathan himself I am happy
to be associated with it
so that amount of money in my account
well um good evening good evening to all
my fellow co-panelists and to all the
viewers out there thank you so much for
having me on your show and it's an
honest pleasure to be on your show
navigation after quite some time uh I
assume
um so as far as the question of I
believe you asked me about the tendering
because I did have a little lapse in the
network so I would request you to kindly
um you know quickly repeat the question
was above 10 crore in fact one was
9.9900 whatever however many zeros there
are in those main roads uh you know that
was that was the sanction all sanctions
below 10 crores were you flouting the
norms
uh right thank you so much for that
question no obviously not that was
definitely not the intention let us not
forget that uh all these approvals were
done uh keeping all the bylaws of the
McD and absolutely all the uh
permissions that were required while the
approval for the renovations was being
taken and let us not forget the McD
approved it which was under the BJP then
uh there was approval of the LG in all
the renovations and absolutely every
construction that was going on so um uh
you time you question the timing of the
renovations let us not forget the
central Vista which was a 20 000 crore
project happening
um during the time of the covet pandemic
was also a very questionable thing and
as far as the tender is concerned let's
not forget when the more we Bridge
construction in Gujarat was being
undertaken the tender of uh two uh crore
is what I understand was being given to
a watch company by the name of orewa it
was was given a 15-year contract so I'd
like to see a time when you know times
now debates um these scams done under
the BJP regime by the PM Modi himself
15 lakh rupees because Narendra Modi has
come into the conversation
but I want to I want to catch a lot Live
Well I want to practice
tonight and I'm just sending this
document to my director because I just
got this document ladies and gentlemen
and I want to break this document uh
Sharif the document is there if you can
put it on the screen I can just show it
to the people of India and this document
says all day long there has been this
defense that the McD cleared this here
in my hand I hold this document of 2000
and 17 18th of May 2017 North Delhi
Municipal Corporation Office of the
chief engineer and and this says
Corporation has decided that PWD
projects to be used for public purpose
are exempt from seeking any sanction for
building plan from the local bodies as
per provision of section so and so they
are further they however they shall give
reasonable notice to the local bodies
that is the concerned zonal building as
per provision so they do not need
sanction they only need to give notice
there is no sanction
which says that and this is dated
2017. so your lies are
on live television to
just
ice
what do you want to say that you lied on
National Television
can I respond can I respond just in 20
seconds if I may be allowed yes please
just 20 seconds yes what's what's your
defense
um so so we there are there are also
scams which says that uh 191 CR uh for
the private jet of uh Vijay rupani not
related to the documents I will bypass
that question because this question this
question is
debated on another day but let me get in
Kohli
all along accents yes
you can't lie on national television and
you can't go off the subject
my question to you is this document
really takes away and takes the wind out
of the sales of the defense that the
ahmadmi party was putting that there was
an MCD clearance
duac clearance
because in 2017 NCD had said PWD for all
government Bungalows uh can go about
construction without submitting plans so
where is the defense today
there is no defense but for a moment
navig step back
first
houses will get renovated they will be
by different governments different
political parties that is not an issue
that's one part of the issue
but the other part is which is that
there is no other political person in
the entire landscape of India perhaps
the whole world but certainly in India
who lies so blatantly as arvind kejriwal
and you have to only pick up Mr arvind
kejriwal's every statement from the day
he joined something called India against
corruption movement
till date
each time we only have to play what he
said then and what he says now or does
now that's it they are Polar Opposites
they are not even variations they are
Polar Opposites
this is what circulates
this is
he takes the cake because whatever he
says he does the polar opposite now
either he's a pathological liar and it's
as simple as that because these are two
Polar Opposites or what he promises in
the whole world and what he does exactly
after that oh he doesn't care that he
believes that I can say anything it's
not a lie which is another way of
looking at it whatever I say today is
what I I want to say today it doesn't
have any relation to what I've said in
the past I don't know which of the two
it is but I think that if this is
perhaps a good time for Anna's energy to
actually start a movement against what
he has created which is arvind kejriwal
and all the people who came in the
so-called India against corruption
because if this is not Corruption of
ideology nothing else would ever be well
the question is and and if I if I begin
to talk about details that have really
angered the ahmadmi details of there are
15 toilets oh my God 15 toilets in that
house
I don't have everybody's house has
toilets but 15 of them
may I tell you vanities in each toilet
one lakh rupees so 15 lakh rupees on
that and sanitary fittings and other 11
lakh rupees 25 lakh rupees
on toilets
I mean that's that's one part flow
about a couple of crores there are
marble about five crores there are
wooden paneling about five crores
is number one number two flouting the
ten crore Norm because every
every sanction is below 10 crores one
even 9.99 what does that show you and
number three NCD gave permission and we
have done everything neither the doac
nor the McD no permissions were there at
least when the construction began
how many lies in a row
and navika I think making 15 toilets uh
was justified by having kejriwal because
he's hiding in one of them as we speak
he is the guy who comes up without any
excuse and does 12 p.m or 12 noon or 5
noon five afternoon five PM afternoon
press conferences and he is a bowl he's
absent where is he
can I please take three or three or four
um uh uh mention three or four points
because I want to deal only with facts
so fact number one my good friend Huda
Balaji has been exposed because I I
offered 15 lakhs to be
the point is she resorted to what about
me number two Navica she you you you
outed one of her lies let me out another
one of our lives this is the non-stop
coverage of times now
of the morbi bridge disaster when she's
saying it would have been nice now
because he had you mentioned the morbi
bridge times now ran The Morbid tragedy
for two days asking for the resignation
of the chief minister this is India
upfront as well as how are you navika so
light number two and can I also please
now enough of what about the 191 CR
private jet of the Gujarati please
please please don't interrupt I didn't
interrupt you please please thank you
navika I want to congratulate two people
on this panel one is my good friend
ashutosh who left up when he could so
maybe you have to ask him what was it
that he found the truth about kejriwal
that he actually left up number two I
want to congratulate you nabika because
I'll tell you why
you can say goodbye to all the aam aadmi
party and kejriwal advertisements that
will come your way goodbye in the last
10 years the app advertising expenditure
has been raised by four thousand nine
hundred percent last year alone up spent
close to 500 crores in giving ads This
Is How They muffle you know using
Muffler Mr Muffler Man muffles the voice
of the media by giving them money this
is a kind of a blackmail that they do so
congratulations to you that you have not
been deterred by this kind of horrendous
political blackmail and you've come out
with this expose but you know what is
shocking and here I know there was so
much of exposure for you to do that you
forgot the uh perhaps the most tragic
part in all this shall I tell you what
is most tragic it is not that kejriwal
is corrupt that is not news to me or
anyone
it is not that kejriwal is a politician
who spent so much money on his alishant
Bangla that is also not news what is
real tragic is that when people were
dying for want of oxygen cylinders when
people were dying because doctors could
not be there to help them during the
peak covet he was saying that he doesn't
have money to take care of to feed slum
dwellers in Kuwait and he was spending
45 crores in making 15 toilets and God
knows how many bedrooms this is why he
must come out and explain this you are
not because you also mentioned
BJP company that was going on during
covert again
to people who are substantive uh points
to make you're not answering any
questions you're only raising questions
about things that are over behind us we
are raising questions about what was
going on and the hypocrisy of Mr Urban
KJ slightly more C ore see than the
questions that you are raising Anand
continue completion it is
you can't speak over everybody you've
had your turn wait for your next turn
thank you thank you no I I just wanted
to end with you know because I did the
few calculations 900 oxygen cylinders
could have been purchased just by the
money that kejriwal spent not for the
whole refurbishing just by building
those toilets
900 oxygen cylinders he's running around
saying there are no oxygen cylinders
23 mahola clinics could have been opened
so many tens of thousands of people
could have been fed Square meals during
the peak of Delta wave and before that
and after that I want answers from my
chief minister and I say my chief
because I'm a delhiite yes he's my chief
minister where is he he's the one who
said I am not like Modi a coward who
doesn't do press conferences he does one
press conference a day I want him to
come out now and explain this foreign
I want to inform you that our reporters
were not even allowed to enter the press
conference that was held this morning by
Mr Sanjay Singh they were barred from
entering we have been banned as a
channel I thought you congratulated me
uh you know for for ah the expose a for
the documents that we've managed to pull
out ah you don't have to uh you know
thank me for not getting ads because
that clearly is not my editorial
function that is the the management that
takes care of it and I I just hope they
make uh good with the losses that they
may suffer that's not been a
journalist's issue ever I applaud you
for that now because let me also tell
you that one Hindustan times journalist
two years ago wrote five things that app
is doing wrong and she was immediately
removed from a WhatsApp Group by
kejriwal this is how they operate well
uh we we've been banned also and my my
reporters three of them have been
camping outside Mr kejriwal's residence
for the last 27 and a half hours uh
waiting for Mr kejriwal to to either say
that our story is wrong our documents
are wrong or to call them inside and
give them a tour and say
toilet
Dior Paul White marble coach
and that is that is the big explosive
news break that we are going to get you
in just just 30 seconds because we've
managed to track down the marble Wala
the Dior fall White marble Wala who has
supplied that shiny white marble
imported marble from Vietnam uh what
does he say Sharif can we can we just
put out that interview my reporters just
messaged me that he's managed to track
down the marble man what does the marble
man have to say let's just put that in
front of our viewers tonight
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
yeah
total
arches
how would you respond
okay uh navika
Navica I just want to before I start
does that 15 lakh offer is it valid for
me as well
no special privileges it was only for
the lady on the show apart from me that
was yeah
and please
no open offer of bribes and
gratification on National Television I I
cannot allow that
okay
okay now because now let me come to the
answer now a few have to be put before
the people one this is not just
kejriwal's house this is the official
residence of the chief minister of Delhi
so it's not registered in arvind
kejriwal's name it's registered in the
government of delhi's name it's not uh
an individual's house one whoever
becomes the chief minister next will
occupy that Bungalow too it is not only
a house one part of it is a house the
other part is a camp office so there is
a camp office with the chief minister
out of which third out of this 44 crore
30 crore was spent on the house and 14
crore was that on the camp office that's
the oral number given by Sanjay Singh
that's not a problem that's not a fact
that the government say is
the camp office within the premises of
the house
8.11 crore or for the site office the
rest 37 crore on the Bungalow itself
including which costed
cartons of one crore rupees my friend
second can I finish can I finish no you
can't if you if you say wrong facts I
will not allow you to complete wrong
facts not justifying it one minute no no
no no no these are not one minute one
minute let me your question was
sanctions were given in installments the
original idea was not to have such a
large construction additional area was
added at a later stage I think sometime
in September or something of 2021 there
was an additional sanction which was
made because the area increased in size
the construction to area to be
constructed increased in size so all of
this has very logical explanations
should they have spent 44 crores I don't
agree I don't agree but that's not the
point the point is this is not arvind
kejriwal's house this is the House
official residence the chief minister of
Delhi second it was not renovated it was
rebuilt and very importantly in avika
can we have a similar debate on why 15
crore was apparently spent on the
renovation of the LG's Bungalow
apparently I cannot have a debate when I
get the documents or if you get them
before me we will have that debate we
will have that debate absolutely open to
that but it can't be a debate on
apparently okay
no you've had your point you you've had
your time
says this is the official residence of
the chief minister of Delhi it's not
arvind kejriwal's personal residence and
somebody else who becomes the chief
minister will come later and live in it
number one number two it also includes a
camp office so what if it is within the
is being allowed to go in or come out so
why why is there spaces for public I
don't know and and of course the other
karcha and then he is talking about
sanctions it was there is no sanction
even the dusc says you've come for a
sanction after after the construction
has already begun many questions and of
course nobody is answering the question
of the 10 crore sec come
why why was there need to keep every
sanction below 10 crores doesn't it
raise eyebrows ashutosh your word
wouldn't care whether this was not
even kejriwal's personal property
I don't care whether this is a chief
minister Bangalore or not what I care is
that what arvind kejriwal has said in
2011 where Anna moment was happening
very challenged the entire political
establishment when he blamed everybody
for indulging into corruption and the
but uh numerous Clips where he is openly
saying that I don't need more than three
four room flat or a house I am at me
so I don't need them and then he
questioned why these Minister the chief
ministers are living in palatial
bangalows
why they need a red red uh
so for me it is not important how much
Mr Modi is spending is spending how much
that's not of my concern my concern is
you set the Benchmark you said that you
are Ahmad means chief minister you said
and you Challenger revolted against
these kind of Privileges and luxuries if
you are not revolted against these kind
of privilege and luxuries I would not
have evaluated you on this this course
so I do not agree with with the uh with
someone
of 2011 is asking questions about 2020
through how dare you indulge into these
kind of up luxuries whose money is this
is it not a taxpayers money is it not
because of such thing that you challenge
abuse criticize ridiculed condemn
intimidated every political leader in
the country now when you are indulging
into the same thing why you should not
be asked and why you should not answer
that what made you that you have changed
so much from 2011 and you have you are a
different person in 2023 so I don't care
whether Mr Modi is spending 15 15 crore
or 50 100 crore I am I am concerned that
the same person who in 2014 when he was
looking for a house then a duple was
suggested to him that this should be
your your your place of residence and he
almost finalized when he finalized a few
Volunteers in the senior leader the
Ahmadi party they objected to that and
it is it is a matter of record 4th
January 2014 look Times of India Indian
Express you will you will see arvind
kejriwal's statement where he's saying
since my volunteers and objected so I
will move to a smaller place and then we
move to a three room flat in in in tilak
lane behind patiala house
I'm looking for that I'm not looking for
this man who's living into the palation
I don't recognize him
and ashutosh is somebody
who worked with him
even
even about forget about the man called
you know doctor then I'll come back to
you talk to Sanjay jha first Dr Sanjay
jha yeah no no I just want to make one
point I am not defending the spending of
so much money at all I am not defending
kejriwal on this shootie I I made that
point right at the beginning I said
should he have spent 45 crore no but we
have to speak the fact that this is the
official residence of the chief minister
he forms a political party and within a
year's time he becomes the chief
minister and he gets 67 seats in 2015
out of 70. why this why the people had
shown so much trust and faith in him the
people that showed their trust and faith
in him because he was not like a
politician because he was he was he was
giving sermons to everybody that the
politicians should live a simple life
they don't need a Bangalore and palacian
Palacio Bangalore they
as you can do into this then you are
betraying the the basic Trust of the
people who reports in you now they feel
betrayed it's a death of a dream
absolutely it's death of a dream and do
these do these documents uh and there's
this operations
actually show you what's this
I'm lowering all faders Dr Sanjay
um I remember representing the Congress
at a time when we had maximum hostility
from arvind kejri wallet and I thought
they were extremely sanctimonious very
self-righteous and as we all know doing
a lot of scoot and then you know kind of
shoot kind of politics my simple humble
opinion here is that if you are a public
servant you are an elected politician or
anybody in public life then frugality
needs to take precedence over
flamboyance you have to be more simple
as opposed to being Swank and I do
believe I agree with ashutosh and I
agree with even sumanth that while he
may be entitled as a chief minister to
live in a bungalow of a certain standard
and at the end of it damages not just
his but Ahmad party's credibility I
don't think this is a point that can be
disputed my full answer though
p and therefore I pose this counter
question that there are questions going
to be asked by everybody in India why is
India's political party so corrupted
that we are at our best when you are
pointing fingers at the others but we
tend to be very dubious when we are
asked questions I'll give you one thing
I have not been to the BJP office nalin
happens to be somebody I respect a lot
he's a very dear friend but I do want to
ask this question of nalin and he is on
your program I hope you'll answer that
I've heard darling that your office in
Delhi the BJP office is phenomenal and
the expenditure of that ranges from what
I read 800 crores to thousand crores
plus
anybody I know asking you as an ordinary
citizen of India within four or five
years of being in power how did the BJP
he makes such a phenomenal office
apparently very Swanky and modern good
luck to you but where did that money
come from who funds you and you don't
you don't want to ask that question of
arvind kejriwal documents which had just
come out but you want to raise that
question from the BJP about a building
that has been discussed to death but
nalin Kohli be my guest respond to Dr
Sanjay jha because uh you know
anti-bjp ism is the only thing that
drives him no I agree now because that
any ostentatious pretentious expenditure
done what about what about the hypocrisy
what about the promises that ashutosh
says from 2011 you kept telling people
okay
today he becomes a politician for
excellence that's he spends 45 crore on
renovation that question escapes you and
only a question of the bjp's propriety
raises you're not even you know
yesterday when about propriety today I
am raising questions also about flouting
of no Norms maybe maybe some corruption
in the middle of all of that because no
tenders were done and you know money is
given one crore for consultancy you
don't have questions on that but you
have questions on the BJP so nalin Kohli
please answer questions of the beach
so I have three things to say now
because you first there is no designated
Chief ministers bungalow this is a house
which is being made comfortable for the
chief minister of Delhi for which 45
crores is being spent to make him
comfortable and additionally to the 45
crores is a swimming pool of about 9
crores so that he doesn't need to swim
in the yamuna which he is promising to
clean for so long and has a private pool
so let's get the facts clear there is no
designated
all lived in different Bungalows just as
ministers live in different and that's
why I said Renovations happen you will
have improvements but this really Takes
the Cake number two is on what Sanjay
jha my good friend says look I am not
involved in the construction but let me
take it on head on I don't know the
figures but I do understand construction
so I'll tell you first of all 800 crores
is a figure that was spent on the
Commonwealth scam on the nehru
jawaharlal nehru Redevelopment so I just
want you to get a scale of how much 800
crores does which was considered a scam
to assuming which I don't even know what
the figures are assuming the BJP office
is some 50 60 30 70 000 square feet even
if it were at four or five thousand
rupees a square foot which any
construction person would tell you
because I'm sure the Congress has had a
long history with Builders and all the
scams that took place in between they
would know that this figure is going to
be one twentieth of what you are saying
so I'm just simply saying so I'm just
simply saying don't come with these
figures these are the Rahul Gandhi's
approach one way let me make it to head
on this is Rahul Gandhi's approach which
is you pick up a figure and suddenly
says
because this is what the Congress that
ecosystem has been used to you can't
think of a scam of you know two three
four five crores because that's not a
scale at which the Congress ever worked
so just to tell you again there's no
question and last which is the most
important so you see I don't run away
from it I have been prabhari of four
states
let's now respect each other I didn't
interrupt you Mr I am giving a straight
answer from the bjp's perspective I say
this from personal experience I've just
done the nagaland elections and I've sat
with every chartered accountant who
comes who demands every rupees thing
because they say this has to go into the
accounts of the election commission so
if you are so particular about it as the
biggest political party I'll bet you
that everything on the construction also
is equally going to be put out there
just because you don't no don't make an
allegation
well why don't you become transparent
about it well I I want to I want to get
on to a question and which is a serious
question in all of this and who does the
question is very simple
and you know anandaranganathan started
with this
PM is pending but you have condemned the
Prime Minister you have said you are not
like him you are different you talk
about the uh you know rupani is plain
for 1.91 or whatever many crores you
have said that you are nothing like the
BJP you are simple people you are people
who are not going to fit into the Frills
and fancies of regular politics and you
will give governance which is of the
mohalla clinic type which is of the
school education type that is that is
the breath of fresh air that you
promised the people of Delhi and that
has been the statement you've taken to
the rest of India in all the elections
that Mr arvind kejriwal has taken part
in my question to you is why today are
you then comparing yourself with the BJP
why are you preparing yourself with
Sheila Dixit
thus is statement
her house is way more modest and I've
been there I don't need anybody's
certificate for that I've seen it on my
own
had a more modest house than the bills
of Mr arvind kejibals I want to ask you
if all this is wrong and if our
impression is wrong why doesn't he open
the door and allow our cameras to go in
why not why is he Banning us why is he
not answering us that's the question
well I'd like to start answering by
first answering the question from Dr
anganathan the statement that he put out
there that if I'm going to put out a
statement without you know mentioning
BJP or Prime Minister Modi in my
statement and then he's going to
transfer that certain amount I'm glad it
did not happen because then they will
they might well be a CBI Ed rate on me
which is will become the status quo for
the BJP so I'm glad I did not I do not
have access to that kind of money
um
and secondly
hahaha
mom gosh
I mean I'm sure I would be doing much
better in life but yes sir I believe in
austerity uh coming back coming back uh
to um your question
uh like my esteem co-panelists uh just
mentioned this is um a bungalow not for
his personal use I mean unless and until
times now has actually
um you know understood and um I mean
they're kind of accepting that arvind
keji balji will be the CM for all times
to come in Delhi I mean if that is the
case then Bravo I mean at least that is
one thing um you know time is probably
uh giving you know rest assured off if
that's the person
my question to you is if that is
my question to you is
and then this house I've seen it says 21
thousand square feet 21
000 square feet
it is uh it is uh I I can't even imagine
what you know you can open probably a
full Channel out of that accommodation
don't interrupt everybody you know
you're spoiling the debates the question
is to you respond navika very quickly
three points number one I am astonished
and surprised by
um as well as Dr sumanthraman's
cushioning of this quote unquote crime
by saying that this is a bungalow that
is meant for chief minister and not just
kejriwal does that
means
that doesn't mean you can be extravagant
and spend taxpayers money tomorrow I
will say that you know the marble
flooring of Dior is not good enough for
me I want gold panel flooring but
remember it won't be for me forever
other Chief ministers will use it as
well what kind of excuse is this
especially from a guy who uses a
Reynolds pen for five rupees and wears
the same shirt without washing it for a
fortnight
number two
is a fact and I am never denying it even
yesterday in Africa I denied that all
parties are corrupt
it stems from the fact that even the
Electoral bonds are given Anonymous and
by the way for Dr sumantra Who was it
who was talking about the uh you know Dr
Sanjay jha uh only one panelist comes up
with the most
um uh you know believable almost
alien-like uh reasonings for him to say
that BJP also has constructed its office
is that taxpayer money no that is BJP is
money it can make any office that it
wants I can make any house that I want
out of my own money so that comparison
analogy is absolutely and finally I have
to say this here please navika
concentrate on the operative words that
all this happened during the time of
covet when people died please don't
forget that namika I absolutely
absolutely not and Mr arvind kejriwala
at that time didn't have enough money to
buy uh tankers to carry the oxygen Dr
Suman siraman that's one question and
second question many people are now
saying there is even a rumor of a
swimming pool there us indoor swimming
pool
do you do you think that if if there is
a disclosure of the swimming pool then
you will begin to ask questions do you
know anything about a swimming pool
because you know about everything else
about the documents about the government
rules no no no no no no
no if there is a there is a swimming
pool or there isn't a swimming pool
there cannot be a rumor that there is a
swimming pool because this is a place
how do we know you need satellite
photography to find out
Donuts why not why not some somebody
else go in and find out ask the Delhi
ask the construction people there
whether there is a swimming pool there
do an interview at the site with the
construction workers and get the
information out I'm sure you have 100
ways of gathering this information so
anyway if there is a swimming pool again
it is completely unacceptable the point
I'm making is I think it's being missed
by everyone here the point is not that
45 crores is Justified
but if a governor if a bungalow is being
constructed from scratch for a to be
used as a chief Minister's Bungalow
there is a certain inherent cost which
is attached to it now we could quibble
about it and say 21 000 square feet
including a camp office should it be why
can't it be 10 000 square feet with
about three thousand square feet for the
campus but perhaps that would have cost
about 15 to 20 crore look look let's be
very clear the point really is that
there are there is wasteful expenditure
by every government okay should be held
so every government has done wasteful
expenditure and therefore
who set out to put out a new kind of
politics is just like anybody else well
I'm I'm ready to accept that where is
that moral High Ground where is going to
be that sanctimonious lectures that
we've been hearing from 2012. that is
the question people are asking and hold
hold your thoughts because joining me

because I did have a little lapse in the

um you know quickly repeat the question
it was above 10 crore in fact one was
9.9900 whatever however many zeros there
are in those many crores uh you know
that was that was the sanction or all
sanctions below 10 crores were you
flouting the norms
right thank you so much for that
question no obviously not that was
definitely not the intention let us not
forget that all these approvals were
done uh keeping all the bylaws of the
McD and absolutely all the uh
permissions that were required while the
approval for the renovations was being
taken and let us not forget the McD
approved it which was under the BJP then
uh there was approval of the LG in all
the renovations and absolutely every
construction that was going on so um you
time you question the timing of the
renovations let us not forget the
central Vista which was a 20 000 crore
project happening
um during the time of the covet pandemic
was also a very questionable thing and
as far as the tender is concerned let us
not forget when the more we Bridge
construction in Gujarat was being
undertaken the tender of two crore is
what I understand was being given to a
watch company by the name of orewa it
was even a 15-year contract so I'd like
to see a time when um you know times now

Watch what ...,2023-04-26T16:22:00Z,TIMES NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S5X8DQwrY-g/hqdefault.jpg,"good evening ladies and gentlemen
yesterday on times now navbharat we
exposed how a whopping rupees 45 crore
of taxpayers money was pledged on the
renovation and purification of Delhi
chief minister arvind kejriwal 6 Flag
Staff Road Bungalow the arm aadmi today
clearly is asking for it they are angry
and why not
absolutely justified in being angry and
raising questions they Place their trust
and faith in the aam aadmi party but
what did they get in return
because all the claims today have turned
out to be fake promises all money spent
on building a palace for a chief
minister who promised it unconditionally
that he would be honest and loyal to the
this exposing ladies and gentlemen just
keeps getting bigger and bigger tonight
on the news off we will show you how the
Delhi chief minister betrayed the
ahmadni and this was all carried out
with an utter disregard to rules and
regulations a statutory body the Delhi
Urban Arts commission which was set up
by an act of parliament was first misled
for 45 days on the nature and scope of
work carried out inside the chief
Minister's Bungalow its sanction was
only sought after construction had
already begun and this is something that
is noted in the minutes of the meeting
of the duac not just this even the costs
were kept under a cut-off limit below
rupees 10 crore because according to the
General Financial rules a
amount spent by the PWD department or
any Department which was under the 10
crore value could be just okayed by
departmental heads without even going to
senior officials
permission required of any senior
official so the entire bureaucracy had
no idea what was going on
let me now show you one by one how the
Delhi Chief ministers residence
beautification flouted these rules for
the ridiculous splurge on his Mansion
the first document is a minutes of the
meeting of the Delhi Urban Arts
commission from 6 November 2020 and as I
said in an eye course it is mentioned in
the project details that the site work
has already commenced construction can
only commence after approval the
question then is how did the work start
at least 60 days before approval because
the first sanction of 7.92 crores came
on the 1st of September 2020.
clearance being sought in November when
construction is already on at least 60
days in advance in the same meeting
another observation was made that shows
how the statutory body was misled it
says as per the subject proposal is for
additions and alterations and that's
what every document of sanction shows
editions and alterations nowhere does it
show that it is a reconstruction and the
minutes note that however it's clearly
evident that an entirely new building is
proposed by demolishing the existing
structure this needs clarification
that's what the statutory body said the
third document that I have in my hand
reveals that even in its second sitting
that is on the 11th of December 2020 the
commission had not given approval to the
building plan proposal and specific
observations were given then to the
Delhi government
the fourth document shows that it was
only on 18th December 2020 when the duac
gave its approval the revised proposal
was approved with observations the
question then is why did ahmadmi party
approach the nodal body for sanction 50
days after the work had already begun
post facto why and now we show you how
on the 1st of September 2020 that is 100
days before the doac approval
8 crores or 7.91 crores were sanctioned
by the state for additions and
alterations in the additional
accommodation in the chief Minister's
resident it said construction cost of
rupees 7 crore 91 lakhs
19400 has been approved how was the
construction taking place what about
rules remember ladies and gentlemen the
funds were sanctioned in at least six
tranches for the construction of the
chief Minister's residence what's
interesting to note is that all costs
were kept under 10 crores the first
sanction for 7.92 crore the second for
1.64 crore the third for 9.09 crore all
under 10 crore limit the this was
cleverly done to escape the tender root
or so we understand because that's what
the GFR the government financial rules
indicate that below 10 crore just signed
by the chief engineer and move ahead so
was it to bypass the tender procedures
which is why which is the known Norm for
government
procurement the office memorandum of
Delhi government's finance department of
2019 August says that rupees 10 crores
the power is rested with the hod the
head of Department to sanction these
expenses hence the approval of
secretaries was not even required so the
absar car in a very clever manner
managed to bypass the rules no tender
had to be floated and the PWD Securities
were also kept completely out of the
loop
ladies and gentlemen that really becomes
the issue yesterday it was about
propriety today it is flouting the rules
to benefit home
this is the same Mr Robin who once
slammed the then chief minister of Delhi
Sheila Dixit for allegedly having 10 air
conditioners in her home a classic case
of pot calling the kettle black
listening to arvind kejriwal's charge
and that is the interview I did in
Sheila dixit's house
she was chief minister
not half as ostentatious as what these
bills really show what was Mr arvind
kejawal talking about listening
[Applause]
meanwhile even as the ahmadmi party
tried to justify the extravagance the
BJP has asked as to why did the aam
aadmi party hide it all from the amarti
that's the question the BJP history",True,en,3977,19,52

mother of course and the team out there
keeping that worms view of the state and
its developments and everything related
to the Karnataka elections at 7 30 is
your appointment hour with madhav and
team viewers we're going to now focus on
the story that has of course
sparked a massive massive conversation
across the country
viewers
let's look at some facts with regards to
that
45 crore perk that Mr kejriwal handed
himself
viewers
yesterday you watched how your channel
exposed Delhi chief minister arvind
kejriwal's rupees 45 crores splurge on a
spanking new residence
you were shocked to discover that the
work was being done at the height of the
pandemic you were angry when we told you
that rupees 45 crores were splurged by a
government that claimed it had no money
it had no money to purchase oxygenators
or ventilators when you and your kin
were gasping for air
you were resentful when you realized
your trust had been betrayed to splurge
on the unheard of Creature Comforts by a
man who swore to you that he would never
be enticed by them
today viewers the story gets bigger much
bigger your channel has accessed
documentary evidence to show
that this rupees 45 crore perk was
awarded to the Chief Minister by openly
flouting due process
that a statutory body
yes viewers that a statutory body set up
by an act of Parliament that serves like
a watchdog and has the power to
scrutinize to approve reject or modify
proposals was misled for 45 days on what
the exact nature and scope of work was
being carried out inside the chief
Minister's residence in civil lines
viewers
here
in my hand at crucial documents
viewers
sanctions
of this particular Watchdog are
imperative
but those sanctions were only sought
after the construction had begun
that coughs that costs viewers
were kept under a cut-off limit so that
the sanction of the top brass of the
Delhi government's own works department
did not have to be taken
at all
given that each of the work orders
was less than rupees 10 crores
tenders were not required to be floated
viewers and neither was the permission
of the lieutenant governor of Delhi
required to be sought
the idea clearly was to spend taxpayer
money under the radar without letting
the taxpayer without letting you know
for what reason it was being spent
because the moment viewers the ahmadmi
party would have said that it was being
spent
to construct a grand palace
for arvind kejriwal you would have asked
him
but Mr kejriwal you told us that you
would never want to live
in a glittering Ivory Tower
you told us that you were abstemious
that you weren't concerned with Creature
Comforts and material wealth like the
other vvips of latin's Delhi
viewers
all those inconvenient questions that
you could have asked viewers
were never asked because you were never
told
now let's take this one by one
I always present the hard facts to your
viewers
hard facts so that you can get the
closest to the truth
and once you know the truth viewers you
can build your arguments you can ask the
questions and we will again hope yours
that you will be coming out there
tonight once again on our show and
asking questions because we're going to
invite you to do this
now viewers what can we tell you
pay attention to your screens and let me
walk you through this
the daily Urban Arts Commission is a
watchdog it is set up by an act of
Parliament that must approve any
proposal that deals with any
construction
of specific kinds
but viewers this watchdog
notes that on
and this is a note viewers from the 6th
of November
2020 the height of kovit viewers
that the work was begun even without
seeking sanction from the watchtop
it says it is mentioned in the project
details that the site work has already
commenced
construction can only commence after
approval this is very clearly written
here after approval
the question then
it's very simple how did work start at
least 60 days before the panel's
approval was taken
that's a fundamental question
in the same meeting again we were 6 11
2020 just go on to the Delhi Urban Arts
commission's website
go to this date
and you can access this for yourself
this is a very transparent Country Now
viewers
but the doac made another observation
this Watchdog made another observation
which shows how the statutory body set
up by an act of parliament was misled
this document here clearly states as per
the subject proposal is for additions
and alterations however it's clearly
evident that an entirely new building is
being proposed by demolishing the
existing structure this needs
clarification this needs clarification
here it is yours very clearly mentioned
as I told you you can look up the doac
website find this for yourself the date
is 6 11 2020 these are the minutes of
the meeting
go and look for it
on your own if you don't believe me
now viewers I have another document
this is from the 11th of December 2020
the third document which I'm going to
show you shows that even in its second
sitting remember they asked for
clarifications well
the ahmadmi party kindly gave them a
clarification
but it is noticed that the commission
did not approve the building plan
proposal here it is very easily very
easily very easily it is denoted here
amazing
and then once again the panel gave
specific observations to the Delhi
government and asked them to clarify
so why didn't our government clarify to
the panel
and asked about misleading the panel
just a specific question why didn't our
government clarify to the panel as asked
about misleading the panel It'll ask
clearly
why did you mislead
but it didn't clarify
now viewers
I've shown you these documents now
within a week
within a week the ahmadmi party goes
back to the panel
and this document shows how it was only
on 18 December 2020 when the duac gave
its approval the minutes of the meeting
say revised proposal was approved with
observations
the question is why did ARP approach the
panel for sanction 50 days after work
began
and viewers if the duac doesn't clear if
this Watchdog doesn't clear the work
the McD the municipal Corporation of
Delhi cannot approve it now viewers you
and I know
that any municipality will come down on
you heavily if you even make a small
extension in your home
if you remove a window or an ad a
balcony or enclosed one they will come
they'll ask you
they'll find you
because you need a prior approval for
the McD
even for your own residences and this is
a Heritage building viewers so it had to
have the approval first of the Watchdog
then of the McD
now we show you
how on first September 2020 100 days
before the approval by the Watchdog
close to eight crores were sanctioned by
the state for addition and alteration in
the additional accommodation in Chief
Minister's residence it says
construction costs of rupees seven
crores 91 lakhs
19400 has been approved now viewers can
you imagine your money
he was taking your money the ahmadmi
party was
dipping
its hands into your taxpayer savings
to spend on a project that at that point
hadn't been approved
how do we know viewers that the cost was
actually
what they claim it was for all these
works
we don't know
remember there was no tendering process
and these are all the
work notes viewers these are
all of them
work orders and there are many of them
here
each one of these work orders viewers
is very interesting
the work began
no sanction remember the funds were
sanctioned in at least five trenches for
the construction
of the CM residents therefore I have
five work orders in my hand viewers five
of them
a look at the work sanctions will show
how all the costs were kept deliberately
under 10 crores
take a look at this
the first sanction
was for 7.92 crores
the second one was for 1.64 crores the
third sanction was for 909 crores the
fourth was for 8.68 crores
then rupees 9.34 crores
but why were all costs under rupees 10
crores here's why because the office
memorandum
of the government of delhi's finance
department of 2019 says that for
expenses and here it is viewers here is
the office memorandum
for expenses below 10 crores there is no
need to take the approval of the public
works department secretary or that of
the engineering in Chief these are two
top people
only an hod's approval is required head
of Department
this meant that even the LG had no clue
and most significantly the app didn't
need
to float any tender for the work
viewers
it could easily
it could easily just
ask its own Minister satender Jain and
you know where Satan the Jain is views
he's in jail
getting massaged
sit in the gym
would therefore
I won't trust him
with public funds
but the update viewers
he busily sanctioned 45 crores merrily
did so
thinking that wow
I can do a favor
at public expense
so my boss will love me
satinder gen signed off he was no
question to ask the LG had no clue the
engineer in Chief of the PWD Department
had no clue the secretary of the
department had no clue some hod
underlink also eager to please most
probably viewers signed off
was a tender put out no

you hire contractors without Tinder

you're going to hang up more than a

you are spending on marble flooring
how do you even know that there were no
other Alternatives that could have been
given cheaper
you never ask for a tender viewers
today
the BJP and the Congress
say that they are smelling
they have latched on to the scent of
illegality
that this is no longer about just mirror
morality
about spending during
a dance of death during the corona

part two and yesterday you saw how the
Delhi chief minister splurged 45 crore
rupees of taxpayers money on a Swanky
new residence in the middle of a
pandemic when the Delhi government was
asking for the center to bail them out
because they did not have enough oxygen
plants and oxygenerators at that time
the chief ministers Bungalow was not
just being given a new upgrade it was
being rebuilt and rebuilt with the kind
of Creature Comforts that arvind
kejriwal said he would never be enticed
by 2 say the story is getting bigger
because it is not just about the
spending of the money it is also about
how people who are in positions of
authority who should have given the all
clear were kept in the dark that the
construction started by flouting due
process procedure was ignored and also
how numbers were juggled in a fashion
that
the people who were making this entire
Bungalow would get a free hand that they
would just fly under the radar a little
bit and no one would ask the
uncomfortable question why is one crore
being spent on curtains and showers and
flooring and marble
there was an actual method to this
madness and today we are going to decode
all of that for you so let's take you
one by one through operation sheesh
Mahal part two let's first start by
telling you how you've got a body which
is a statutory body and it's the doac
the urban Arts commission which was
supposed to give a go-ahead for any
construction at the pm at The cm's
Residence at six Flagstaff road to take
place now let's just explain to our
viewers why is this go ahead important
because this is a Heritage building
where the chief minister stays it's a
Heritage building so the doac had to
give its permission but what happened
let's first take you through the minutes
of the meeting from the 6th of November
2020 on the 6th of November 2020 the
doac says it is mentioned in the project
details and the site work has already
commenced how did we start at least 60
days before any approval was given
construction can only commence after
approval this is what the minutes of the
meeting say then let's move forward to
December this is the 6th of November
then in December certain concerns were
again raised this is the 6th of November
as per the subject proposal is for
additions alterations however says the
doac it is clearly evident that an
entirely new building is being proposed
now let's explain to you what's
happening one
doac says you've already started
construction how
second that you are saying that it is a
refurbishment you are redoing renovation
as we call it but an entirely new
building is being proposed they wanted
clarification then came another meeting
that took place in December in the
December meeting also the 11th of
December commission did not approve
specific observations were given let's
fast forward now to the middle of
December so the first intimation comes
in November we come to the middle of
December where the third minutes of
meeting are there on the 18th and that
is when finally the approval was given
and here comes the twist in the tail the
twist in the tail is viewers that even
before that it was in November that the
duac was even told that hello the
construction has already started but do
you know when the first work order was
given for the construction to start it
was on the 1st of September 2020 so if
we are talk about this November 6th of
November 2020 is when doac said how is
the construction started the work order
was given on September 1st which makes
it about September October November
that's two months two months before this
meeting the work order was already given
so essentially what we are saying here
is that work order is given in September
permission is given in December
so September to October October to
November November to December 3 months
the construction work was happening
without any permission the UAC had given
no permission and construction had
already started this is flouting of
norms of a building that was a Heritage
building that's Point number one point
number two now let's come to the part
where
the work orders were very strategically
thought of if we just take you through
the five work orders that we have access
let's quickly fast forward to the work
orders all right
the first one I already showed you was
on the September 1st 2020
the second work order is here it is on
16th June 2021
the third work order on
22nd October 2021
the fourth one is
is
the fifth one is here it is on the 29th
of June and the fourth one here in
between now if you can just come a
little closer I will show you why these
work orders can we please come here I'll
show you why these work orders are
interesting here work order number one
pay attention September 1 2020 pay
attention to this figure
that's seven crores 91 lakhs 19 400
that's work order number one
the second work order is
64 lakhs 10 500 here this is the second
work order the third work order is here
22nd October
that is nine crore eight lakhs fifty two
thousand
fourth one is here
which is five crore 73 lakhs and finally
the fifth one is nine crores 34 lakhs 24
700.
these viewers are very significant
figures why are these figures
significant I will explain to you
because there is a technicality if you
have any work orders that is above 10
crores first of all you need to do
tendering for it then you need to
what you can do is a 45 crore tender
right why didn't you just take out one
tender just make one work order uh you
will there have to put out an open
tender because it has gone above 10
crores this was avoided which is why
instead of doing one work order of 45
crores they did one is for nine crores
one is for 9.99 crores one is for 1.5
crores one is for seven crores so it all
adds up to 45 but it's five different
work orders
what was the need to carry out this
clandestine exercise unless there was
deliberate software if everything was
above board why was this done
let's try and figure it out joining us
now are our guests we have with me
spokesperson of the BJP Kerala sharikari
MD governance now Dr Akash deep money
political analyst Professor manajit
Mandel political analyst professor
mandal
why was this done I mean I really have
no other question because why cost is
done if everything was so above board
why not just take out one work order of
45 crores
well I've comment on the technicalities
but uh if someone can buy flight clock
1500 cores uh by you know destroying the
public extra
one can build the house of twenty
thousand crores during the underlying
sir again you know
about tree why does the Prime Minister
have this suit why we have this pen why
does he have this shoe why does he have
it Muffler as far as I am concerned if
he's buying it with his own money Mr
kgwal can also buy one karodka Muffler I
really don't care right my problem my
problem is you're making it with the
taxpayers
why was it done to understand here's the
difference
I'll actually need one Apples to Apples
comparison pay close attention to this
pay close attention pay close attention
I am doing an Apples to Apples
comparison
one of the examples that has been quoted
is why did the Gujarat chief minister
Vijay rupani buy an aircraft
he bought an aircraft but they put out a
tender for the aircraft as opposed to
here where there was no open tender
because the amount was kept just below
10 crores
you spend 45 crores sir but you do it in
an open transparent fashion my question
to you Professor mandal is very specific
why was there this clandestine exercise
chief minister residence
[Music]
[Music]
why does the chief minister need an
aircraft tomorrow we'll be like why does
the Prime Minister need an SPG approved
car why can't the Prime Minister take a
day to office
I mean what kind of a debate are we even
having
absolutely
you know the thing is here that the
ahmadmi party you know last few weeks
and I was there on your broadcast
network only saying that the only thing
that that is left for them to paint is
to paint their chief minister as God and
a few days after that one of the Member
of Parliament uh Compares him to modern
day Mahatma then if Mr arvind kejriwal
is is cut then no one can be non-corrupt
uh uh on the face of this Earth so I
believe that what the
syndrome
when a person believes that he is equal
to God that is known as a god syndrome
now when it comes to this it is very you
know precisely pointed out by you and
your team on this broadcast that if 45
crores were to be spent
during September 2020 and July 2022 and
we all know the kind of pain that the
city of Delhi went through during the
second wave of kovid I mean uh hospitals
were full the health infrastructure was
full and the chief minister was just not
able to answer that how will the City
come out of it and in the midst of that
and in the midst of that rupees 45 crore
and that through without a proper tender
is being spent on making his house
luxurious without getting new approvals
now how does he face the public with
this
okay God complex answer this
God complex one and why keep it so hush
okay uh first point was you said that
why the work order was given three
months earlier of course as a journalist
you know that work order cannot be given
without the permission of the LG in
Delhi because all the financials are
written I hope that you would have you
have taken their bite have you I think
so you have you have taken bite of all
very good point that you have raised so
here let me tell you what actually
happened this is the reason why these
work orders were specifically kept under
10 crores you know who sanctioned them
who has signed off on them these work
orders were sanctioned without taking
the engineering chief of the PWD nor the
administrative head of the department
none of them the engineering Chief and
the secretary of the PWD were bypassed
leave the LG Dr akashdi puni even the
chief engineer and the secretary were
bypassed which is why I am asking you
sir that is exactly the question
why did you not have the chief engineer
and the secretary sign off
okay now now first of all you know that
the final Authority in Delhi density
is the electron Governor I hope that you
have taken the bite of Anil dejal as a
journalist because you have taken the
bite of all the bgp people so I would
have I am sure you would have taken the
bite of running Brazil why did he sign
on a uh very harsh attitude who the LG
has not signed off okay let us again
show you at the risk of being repetitive
because
the LG has not signed off on this here
are the people who've signed off
assistant engineer assistant engineer
executive engineer superintendent
engineer assistant engineer executive
engineer these are the six people who
have signed off the LG has not signed
off on this now can you answer my
question why were the requisite
authorities kept out of the loop go on
are you saying that you have all the
documents regarding this particular
financial transaction yes yes that is
exactly what I'm saying okay okay you
are staying on television that padmaja
has one minute which is the all
professional transaction for uh the
renovation of individual home are you
know that I am saying that I have got
five work orders which show the kind of
work that was done in Mr kg what is your
question sir or are you just trying to
while away time and make it wild claims
for which you have absolutely no proof I
am showing you with papers that this was
sanctioned at the level we enjoy Google
that finances are with lgm without LG

said the power corrupts and absolute
power corrupts absolutely I think I we
don't need to get into this argument
says
I think this is a very Preposterous
argument our party is trying to make so
all these you know the tendering is a
very complex process and as you very
vividly explain to the process there are
two kinds of tender one is public tender
another is a limited tender in limited
tender you don't make a Publications and
within the threshold limit you can go
for the impalement of the tenderers who
can be given job without going through
any any exhaustive bid so this is this
looks like the way it has been
circumvented the threshold has been
circumvented it looks like a deliberate
attempt by kejriwal government to give
away the award of the contract to those
those people whom he wants to favor like
in liquor gate how he has Twisted the
entire public policy on the liquor and
government of Delhi has suffered in the
hands of this kg government one
politician rightly said he's a
self-serving uh ambitious miguelo Maniac
Maharaja kejriwal I think his bundle of
lies right from the day he set up this
India against corruption he the way he
took the tunation from Ford Foundation
the four lakh the way he has been lying
through his teeth on number of occasions
and he is known for taking U-turn he
apologizes the benefit of Doubt and talk
only about this issue at present if we
can only get a reasonable explanation
for why this entire circumventious
exercise was done in a clandestine
fashion I'm sure there'll be a
reasonable explanation but in the
meantime just to make it really simple
for all of those watching here is what
usually happens if this was say a 12
gender there would be a permission
needed from the engineer in Chief and
the Secretary of TWD then the LG would
also be in the no but when they kept it
below 10 crore the chief engineer
then sanction it and the PWD Minister
okays it so when you keep it at 9.99
crore
you have the chief engineer signing off
and Mr satyendra Jain saying
that is basically what happened thanks
very much all gentlemen for joining me
we're still waiting for an explanation
I'm sure there's a plausible one for why
it was done in this fashion that's it
then from me on this edition of the
nation wants to know I'll see you next
at 10 on the NewsHour agenda where we
have
the next part of operation sheesh Mahal

currently raging at a high-rise
apartment in Noida take us through the
latest uh far as this fire is concerned
visuals which are coming out from a
high-rise apartment this is the 14th
Avenue of Broad City which is
started from the second or third floor
of this particular apartment the fire
has risen to the fifth upload so to on
total what we can say that uh five flows
of this particular building has come
under the impact of this massive fire
which has started uh the initial
response team was from the uh from the
society management and right now the uh
the fire department officers have also
been called in there are around
thousands of houses that are active
which are inside these apartments there
are multiple apartment uh building
structure which has been called made by
the god Builders and this is the 14th
Avenue which has come under the impact
of massive fire there's no report of any
kind of casualty which has come up from
the location so far but looking at the
wave the fire is rising subtly is a very
shocking and very serious for those
people who have been staying here most
most of the people who say in these
apartments you know happened from the
nuclear family so we you know denied the
possibility that they could be someone
who was trapped but because of the good
response of the society management uh
they have managed to rescue all those
people who were trapped there are around
21 to 20 stores on each of these
buildings they can also come under the
impact of this fire and it is also
serious to know that whether such of the
building can also be damaged because of
the fire that is still going on
is there any information you know we
don't know anything about casualties but
any information if there was anyone
present in this high-rise apartment uh
when the fire initially took place yes
many people who were there inside these
Flats which
you know the position was taken by them
by five six years back but fall into uh
the developmental Redevelopment
structure in these areas there are there
are thousands of people who say I mean
in this apartment uh what we have got to
know that the rescue team is still there
there's no further report of any kind of
injury or casualty but the biggest worry
for the residents is that whether the
structure of the building can also be
damaged because the fire is uh certainly
rising and uh it's getting enlarged with
time and you know Bianca I understand
that the details are a bit sketchy at
the moment but do that you know these
people who were present in these
apartments uh or you know the nearby
apartments have they all been pulled out
um you know no reports on casualties I
understand but any report on the number
of people who perhaps have been rescued
or the type of rescue operations which
are currently underway
started then what we are understanding
that the fire has captured at least
three blocks of this particular South
Avenue uh the 14 South Avenue has around
uh 10 to 15 tasks and all these stars

antionette's proportion vanity project
undertaken undertaken at the peak of a
pandemic that left thousands of
delhiites gasping for oxygen begging for
beds and meds
it was even red flagged by a statutory
body the Delhi Urban Arts Commission
but kejriwal would Brook viewers no
opposition the perk was more important
it would appear
to him
then Public Welfare today it stands on
hundreds of square yards of Dior Pearl
marble walls coseted in teak wood
customized with bathroom fittings and
closets and swaddled in curtains at a
cost that could have changed many lives

told you viewers the expenses are
detailed
and on your screens is the account
is the account the total money spent on
marble on this rare quality marble that
is imported viewers
this marble that is called Dior Pearl
marble
viewers a crore in 15 lakhs
the amount spent on polishing
21 lakhs
could have been spent viewers on
building
three homes
four homes
half a dozen homes under the Prime
Minister avas yojana but that money
viewers was spent on just polishing this
marble
this is a renovation we are not talking
about the construction of a new home
here 45 crores on a renovation
viewers
I'm not even sure
if the palace in which Marie Antoinette
lived
today
would cost 45 crores to renovate
what was this renovation it's completely
unprecedented
three crores 33 lakhs 88 000 spent on
installing marble
that's that's just the cost viewers of
the floor on which Mr kejriwal now
walks on
luxurious
on viewers
this is not the only obscene expenditure
and all of these expenses were taking
place viewers when the ahmadmi party was
screaming about the fact that it had no
funds to supply you oxygen
to set up these accumulators
oxygen accumulators they said we have no
money we didn't even have money the app
said to buy vaccines
viewers this happened between 2020 and
2021 the two peaks
of the pandemic
the Delta pandemic viewers
the Delta pandemic left you
grasping
grasping
at any lifeline and gasping for the most
important one which is oxygen
and these people viewers were polishing
flaws at that time
so that Mr casual could walk
he could walk
into latin's ostentatiousness
this man viewers who said that he was
the very antithesis of it who drove
around in a wagon r
who was as I told you viewers
a common man among common men in a
caricature that even r.k lakshman
would have been proud of drawing
this Muffler Man
in unfashionable square-like trousers
and a bush shirt
viewers
this was just the marble
let's talk about the next big Splurge
this next perk curtains viewers curtains
that most of us sort of change every two
or three years but no Mr kejriwal wanted
curtains 23 of them
how many have been put up eight have
been put up
curtains

15 viewers total amount spent is almost
a crore

this beautiful palace that he lives in
is swaddled in almost a crore worth of
curtains viewers this was one curtain

would have been proud of taking
if you were acting in theater but this
is we basically viewers the theater of

total amount of curtains that have
already been delivered 45 lakhs 58 000.
there are more to be installed viewers
how much more
how much more of the world you want to
block out Mr case you are
how much more of the world
do you want to block out sir
yes viewers
cost of the first curtain about five
lakhs
second was six lakhs another one for
five lakh seven lakh three five six
three it just goes on and on
how much is being cloaked
well viewers
why would you want to cover a beautiful
marble floor with anything why would you
want to put any distance between the
soles of your feet and this beautiful
floor but for Mr kg while it had to be
it had to be six hand tufted wool
carpets were ordered carpets were put on
ground in for first floor total cost was
just 19 lakhs in 89 000. viewers
six carpets were 20 lakhs the cost of
the first carpet was as you can see five
lakhs
the cost of the second almost four

call it viewers the ground floor kitchen
look at the money
31 lakhs the second floor kitchen 32
lakhs total expenditure 63 lakhs viewers

several questions of course

are not even for a moment suggesting it
is I don't know of course
if permissions were sought we certainly
can tell you that the Delhi Urban Arts
commission at Red Flag they're saying
that you shouldn't be spending this
but they were too late even they didn't
know
the renovation already begun
why it wasn't halted after the duac
raised a red flag I can't say that's for
the ahmadmi party to answer but right
now viewers are hiding behind this sort
of species argument that look other
politicians spend a lot more
no viewers
other politicians didn't go out there
saying that we hold ourselves to higher
standards that we are the arm among the
ahmadmi no viewers they don't say that
it can even be argued viewers that this
is a bungalow to be used in posterity by
our chief minister respect to what party
they belong to
but what is shocking is the timing of
this expenditure when Delhi along with
the rest of India was in the throes of
the covet crisis
the Delta moment money was spent on a
Swanky upgrade on Mr keizer's house at
the time when the ahmadmi party was
saying they don't have enough money
and where we go to provide oxygen and
vaccines for people of Delhi crores were
being spent on this Monumental frippery
viewers
the impropriety of this expenditure
goals
here's what we mean
[Music]
Delhi
accused of people seeking oxygen beds
and shots applied
[Music]
looking after running out of money and
the time something else was happening in
there
a renovation a refurbishment a redo and
it was being done for the man who runs
Delhi chief minister arvind kejriwal
what's shocking is that when Delhi was
suffering money was being pumped into
beautifying the Delhi Chief Minister's
official residence
on the 1st of September 2020 the Delhi
government sanctioned seven crore 91
lakh rupees for the cm's residents to be
renovated this is when the country was
battling the first wave of covet
on the 8th of June 2021 an additional
one crore 64 lakh rupees were sanctioned
this was when the second deadly coveted
wave was at its peak remember it's at
this time when Delhi faced an acute
oxygen crisis and migrants exodus
a third tranche of nine crores 9 lakhs
were allocated on the 22nd of October
2021. at this time also the fight
against kovid wasn't over
thank you
the party that has emphasized frugality
as its calling card the splurge and its
timing is mind-boggling what was the
need for such major spending what was
the need for such expensive marble and
carpets what was the need what was the
urgency the question then is simple in
the middle of a pandemic what was the
priority of the Delhi government to save
lives of the ahmadmi or to upgrade their
own lives
popular report that's not
Mr case you are somewhere along the line
also acquired a deep love for the fine
things in life viewers and therefore
decorations
on
on the walls
viewers
paneling wood paneling teak wood
paneling
and of course curios Antiquities Etc all
needed to be
put in and I can show you a picture
nitish Kumar recently called upon arvind
keju Allen they sat in what appears to
be one of the anti-rooms perhaps even a
reception room viewers I don't know
but all these decorative
Interiors this entire refurbishment
has caused three crores 51 lakhs
decorative Interiors
the decorations on the walls 85 lakhs
must obviously viewers include paintings
and the like and all sorts of other
things if you can just put the
photograph of that meeting on one side
it would be very good
we're also opening this up to you
viewers
kejriwal gets a car shop
and the question that we've asked is a
very simple one
it's not one of those extremely
complicated ones there's this 45 crore
perk tint kejriwal's arm aadmi status
it's very simple one viewers we'd like
to hear from you
you're our family times now is family
and I know you are tuned in tonight and
you would perhaps have an opinion
positive negative doesn't matter Bring
It On viewers
uh
there's also of course
this entire 4 crore 37 lakh expenditure
and Curiosities and those are the
pictures and it looks I must say quite
swanky
I mean this really
is the as I told you viewers this is uh
these are fripperies
of a merry Antoinette proportion
as I told you viewers a little early
in the show
I mean
this really is an escape from the
drabness of the plebeian life then Mr
kejriwal
really championed
so a lot has changed a lot has changed
in this Ivory Tower which has been given
this beautiful facelift
beautiful facelift uh they're also of
course viewers closets
yes there are closets there is
other Furniture I mean these closets
themselves views are stunningly
expensive
um
for public cars for
cars in the closet I don't know I can
come up with many puns tonight but the
dresser in the chief Minister's bedroom
is just about eight lakhs that's more
than the price really of two the cost
ratio of two
homes that could have been built for the
poor under the PM awas yojana
so here's the dresser itself the
Wardrobe in the chief Minister's parents
bedroom
five and a half lakhs the dresser in the
chief Minister's parents bedroom five
and a half lakhs the Wardrobe in the
chief Minister's sun room 7 lakhs 92
000.
yes viewers
I mean the Wardrobe is that expensive it
must really be protecting
some very
some very very
clothing also
the cm's daughter at 3 lakhs 88 000
while drumming the first floor bedroom 4
lakh 66 000 wardrobe on the second floor
three lakhs into five so the five
wardrobe so that's about 15 lakhs total
spend is 40 lakhs now let me tell you
viewers had this money been spent on
other things what could it have bought
had had the chief minister really been
public spirited at that time of need
he spent 45 crores viewers working about
subsidies for 1685.
people
ews and low income group beneficiaries
would have got these subsidies I mean
you could have really changed their
lives transform their lives 1685
families could have been living
a very different life viewers
a six lakh loan to 750 people in ews in
low income strata and you know viewers
how these loans have been repaid so the
loans really set you upon a different
cost in life 4500 SRAM dollars could
have been given one lakh for
rehabilitation each
12
459 oxygen concentrators could have been
bought at the height of the pandemic
when the Ahmad party was saying we don't
have the money
viewers 2 lakh 25 000 PPE kits could
have been bought to protect doctors and
other caregivers at that time
2710 oxygen ventilators could have been
bought
a whopping 22 lakh doses of Kobe Shield
vaccine could have been purchased by the
Delhi government 15 of Kovacs in 15 lakh
doses of co-vaccine could have been
purchased 4500 hospital beds could have
been set up by the government viewers
you remember the paucity of beds at that
time
180 classrooms for 7 200 students in a
government School
7200 and students could have been
getting an education today viewers
there are some big questions and we're
going to pose those big questions but
obviously viewers like to also hear from
you but let me open this up today today
is one of those days viewers
where
where we call out hypocrisy
we call out hypocrisy and let me first
begin by playing out a sequence
from the ahmadmi party Member of
Parliament raghav chadda
who spoke to us and this is what he said
and I and I hope we can play that out
let's play out raghav does responds to
us
uh is it ready can we go to it let's go
let's go to it there it is on your
screens
yes
foreign
viewers
during that comparison
remember these were some of these
political parties of the opposition
viewers had a problem with the central
Vista project
and they said that uh oh look at this
vanity project
well a parliament that was constructed
in 1911 viewers there is documented
audits that tell you and not just by the
BJP
jerem Ramesh the very valuable jairam
Ramesh of the congress party was saying
that we need
an upgrade Parliament is going to
crumble around us he was obviously
speaking hopefully he was
uh
about the architecture because
unfortunately in practice it has really
crumbled but that apart that apart views
he was saying it's going to collapse one
of these days on our heads we needed a
new Parliament we are expanding a new
parliament in 2026 there's going to be
of course more seats added we need the
space
the central Vista itself viewers
was built by the British
British sensibilities
it packed away Parliament to the side
tucked it away as if it was embarrassed
by India's yearning for a democracy
it is perhaps the most insignificant
building on that entire vistavius
device legal Lodge
this big rashtrapati Bhavan was the was
capricining
the power
of Imperial
British might viewers
the focus was on that and then there was
of course India Gate and this that the
other you know that viewers you know all
of that today Mr casual says that no no
that's all 42 is when my Bungalow was
made come on it required a bit of a
spitting polish job and you know 45
crores
what is that it's a drop in the bucket
you know it's a small little thing let
me let me let me bring in Dr Anand
ranganathan uh
as perhaps the only person drawn from
Civil Society here apart from Dr Suman C
Rahman
uh I just want to ask you
I mean at the height of the pandemic
when the app was saying that it didn't
have finances to buy you I
own times now's family
uh the basics you know oxygen this that
the other this was this construction on
this frippery was going on I I don't
know it's pretty unprecedented and even
the duac and other sort of red flag did
uh what do you make of it
uh good evening Raul I hope you noticed
the delicious irony in the photograph
that you showed of this sheesh Mahal
where Mr kejriwal is sitting next to uh
I think nitish Kumar I hope you noticed
that in between those two is this
wonderful
you know
they the only thing left for kejriwal to
do in this sheesh Mahal built through 45
crores of taxpayers money is to sit on
his throne and admire someone dancing to
a Neta Bane
45 crores could have bought thousands of
oxygen cylinders and ventilators and
opened tens of mohalla clinics fed tens
of thousands of daily ads during covet
truly kejriwal has made a marble
Mausoleum on the graves of delhiites who
succumbed to covet there is no other way
of saying this I thought ah tried it in
being different from the other party
this is the party that celebrates
Anarchy that publicly employed citizens
to elect goons and thugs that bought out
much of the media with taxpayers money
our government ad spending has increased
Rahul by 4273 percent over the last 10
years last year they spent 488 crores on
ads it is the same kejriwal who spent
taxpayers money for paying exorbitant
lawyers fee to the late Ramjet malani in
a case where ultimately had to furnish a
graveling apology so that taxpayers paid
from their pockets for kejri was lies
honestly if satender Jain deserves the
bharata for his work then Taliban
deserve the UNESCO price for women
empowerment from turning daily into
London to cleaning the yamuna perfectly
to removing pollution by stopping Farm
fires in Punjab that is not controlled
by up no one has lied as much as
kejriwal and as for his education model
four years into the government of
sanctioned strength of 66 000 teachers
in Daily government schools only 21 000
were filled by regular teachers as of
March 22 52 percent of trained graduate
teaching positions and dailies
government were lying vacant out of 1027
daily schools a 24 are functioning
without a principal half promised 20 new
colleges opened only one promised 500
schools in 2015. according to RTR 2019
42 new schools were open in five years
but you know this also has to be said
finally if you accept the fact like I do
that app is as corrupt as all other
parties a kind of soothing calmness
Dawns upon you so we should accept uh
stop getting shocked by kejriwal and his
Antics and relax he and his party are
exactly the same as the leader of any
political party corrupt and malleable
and hypocritical to the core maybe
that's why it keeps getting elected
democracy is more often than we'd like
to edit my whole not so much the defeat
of the elected as it is of the
electorate just 10 seconds so let us not
talk of corruption
of course this story
uh at best talks about moral corruption
I can't say that you know I just want to
bring in Huda zariwala this is a
question that I want to ask you very
curious about it you know Dr ranganathan
referenced the numbers I've forgotten
the numbers but a lot of money was spent
on advertisements by the ahmadmi party
that's what he's saying now I want to
ask you
this pawn shop for ads Why didn't it
ever extend
to telling India that look what a grant
refurbishment I am doing
of this beautiful Heritage building
the Raj nivas in Delhi
Mr raghav Chadha said 1952 it was made
now if you are restoring it to greater
glory you would be proud of it this is a
project that you are undertaking to save
the heritage of this country
you never put it out can you also point
out if there was an ad put out if there
was even a press conference held telling
the people of Delhi happening
we are using that money just a little
bit of it
45 crores of it
we could have actually Built 7
180 classrooms for 7200 students but
we are not doing that
because there will be greater benefit
from keeping Chief ministers happy after
all if you have a chief minister Peace
of Mind you'll have a better working
Delhi so I just want to ask you why
didn't you tell the public of Delhi
45 crores spent Carnival amongst other
thing on curtains on a nice shiny what
is it
what is the name of this floor I've you
know Dior not Christian Dior but Dior I
don't know someone came up with you know
I mean the French you have to and yeah
Dior Dior marble even your smiling even
you're smiling
Dior marble flooring absolutely I'm sure
you live in a beautiful house you would
also want this shiny dirt I'm told that
you can see your face in this Dior
flooring
foreign
uh good evening is uh you know I mean
just the um just the fact that uh these
um you know all these uh expenditure and
these numbers are bought out against uh
you know arvind kejivaldi whereas we are
forgetting you just mentioned about ads
let me quote uh the Bureau of Outreach
and communication under the ministry of
information broadcasting that said that
a whopping rupees 1.95 crore was spent
per day I repeat per day on an average
on advertisements between 2019 to 2020
by the BJP government Rupees at
3767.265 of the taxpayers money were
spent on print electronic and outdoor
media and printed publicity the Modi
government lavished a whopping of
6506 crores in advertising since coming
to power in 2014 and the breaker
translates to rupees 3220 on print media
and rupees
6275 on visuals you spoke about the
central Vista project 20 000 crores was
the cause of the central Vista project
against a 971 crores which was you know
the number that was being floated around
that day the PM fund case which um you
know the Corpus had tripled two rupees
uh 10 990 crores in the financial year
2020 to 2021 the dispersal was only
3976 crores I mean we are talking about
a government that has done nothing but
written off loans of the of the likes of
the people of Ambani and adani if you
just speak about one right of I'm
speaking on the um
you know just for the matter for the
expenditure of the Navi Mumbai airport
1770 crores written off by the SBI so
just one point that I'm trying to make
up this is we're talking about the Modi
government okay government where do we
see the debates when we speak about
these things very bad the reason why I
was smiling the Modi government very bad
you know no no listen to me very bad
look look hang on hang on just a minute
absolutely one second okay thank you for
admitting that I just want to ask you if
you allow me
I live in a very simple setup okay just
a very just a very why do you live in
such a simple place
why are you doing this to yourself
you should leave the past behind us I
believe
I believe I believe in austerity or
austerity okay what would you do
what is my chief minister
she believes in austerity and so does
the chief minister
I wish and pray foreign
me
today an equivalence is being drawn they
are saying that look if the Prime
Minister can Splurge but viewers just
jokes apart who does Ariana hasn't
answered my basic question you see
viewers if you are spending this money
and you're proud about spending it to
save the country's Heritage you should
talk about it
maybe you can even open
you know the real Aristocrats in England
that perhaps now people want to Aspire
to the ahmadmi wants to Aspire to they
open their homes for public viewings
they go through they touch the you know
you're allowed to touch the beautiful
velvet curtains and you pay like I I'm
told I've seen one of these places you
pay about 10 15 pounds that's a lot of
money imagine collecting that kind of
money
imagine you'd start an industry
imagine the amount of money you would
raise
people said
it would be so wonderful and you would
make money off it For Whom the people
itself to build those schools that you
haven't built those 180 classrooms that
you could have built imagine how many
schools could 180 classroom
classrooms viewers but I just I just
want to basically raise some concerns
here
because the duac the Delhi Urban Arts
Commission
raised
concerns
in 2020
this happened in November remember the
first money that was sanctioned was in
2020 the first half the first quarter of
2020 for this
so the construction had already begun
and they had said
uh
that the site work has already begun and
it can only commence or construction can
commence only after approval so basic
approval was not taken remember the
central Vista and all these things that
who does zariwala is talking about were
all cleared by the Supreme Court at each
stage these opposition parties viewers
went to the Supreme Court said that oh
this doesn't conform to XY requirement
it doesn't meet this this and that
criteria all cleared by the Supreme
Court every expense has been cleared
here viewers the most basic has not been
done and let me quote
the PWD has described the project as
addition and alteration
the doac is saying this but in reality
it is clearly evident from the
submission that an entirely new building
is being proposed after completely
demolishing the existing structure
so viewers you even butchered the
heritage
and these are serious omissions
and I want to bring in Sanjay jha on
this Sanjay just serious submissions and
I know that you have a problem with Modi
spending money on the central Vista
cleared by Supreme Court certified but
here there are omissions sir
said neither have you taken permission
and what you plan to do you're not doing
can we turn a blind eye to this
uh Rahul let me just give you my answer
very succinctly if I'm not interrupted
I'll just take 45 seconds uh any
ostentatious expenditure done by a
public servant a politician must be
frowned upon must be investigated it
doesn't look appropriate but to me they
elephant the 800 pound elephant in the
room or the gorilla in the room is the
massive investigation in the adani group
which the BJP obviously is very
reluctant to do so my second point I I
want to know I want I want nalin my
friend to answer today
has the adani group funded the BJP
through electoral bonds and also kindly
tell us tell the people of India why is
the BJP so scared and conceding the
truth because you know today Rahul
you're talking about property in
politics I want to ask this question on
transparency and openness as a citizen
of the country not just as a congress
member etc etc why does the BJP hide
from the people of India your viewers
today as to who funds this party okay
but number three I mean I want to know
very critically as to where are the
biggest malfeasance or the people who
have corrupted India's politics who are
absconding and living abroad could see
the patronage of the BJP like nirav
Bodhi and you know lalit Modi why are
they today running free my last point I
agree with Dr Anand ranganathan today I
agree with Anand today because he said
something extremely germane and the I'm
quoting him yeah he says arvind kejriwal
is as corrupt as a leader of any
political party
okay one second I just want to ask the
director I'm a bit confused
uh have you taken a pre-recording of
Sanjay jha I can't tell you
can get in because
we were not talking at any debate I did
about three weeks ago
so hope we didn't take a pre-recording
it's easy live Sanjay Jazz live right
okay
on a day when his party viewers
when his party is unambiguously
criticizing
oh my God he is completely suspended in
a different reality
and I don't know what is going on
tonight I really don't know
he really suspended in a different
reality but nonetheless you see the
problem is that many people are saying
that look uh what's the problem others
have done it they've done it with
greater glory than us so come on give us
a little
you know Daily Bread
what's the big deal
Rahul
I think the problem is Mr kejriwal's
statements at one point and what he does
exactly opposite thereafter
I don't have a problem with the house
being renovated I genuinely don't
because houses will need to be renovated
things would happen they would happen
for anybody from a government bureaucrat
who's living in the lowest category of
government house to the highest person
who may be elected may not be elected
that's routine it is to happen
but what has does not happen is when you
have an arvind kejriwal what was he born
in
he was born in a movement called India
against corruption against a person a
under the tutelage of a person Anna
hazare who lives in austere life who was
his Guru and arvind kejriwal became what
was the primary shisha all the others he
ousted he was the primary shisher he's
the one who on millions of televisions
and social media his bytes are they said
I will not change my car I will live in
a simple house in my own flat
he has drilled that so many millions of
times that people got believed that here
is a man who's coming to change the
system
Mr kejriwal now we know in the six seven
years eight years that we've seen him is
a pathological liar
he says one thing today and does exactly
the opposite tomorrow
now that is a pathological lie because
it's consistent not at one it happens
everywhere
these are his genuine answers
okay so you're saying well look viewers
no it's not moral ground okay it is a
trend it's a trend I'm saying this is Mr
kejriwal okay but he will say one thing
and do the opposite but remember but
remember you have to accept this is
the duac that red flag this project also
red flag the Parliament building and
sought more details from the cpwd which
of course were given viewers so it's not
as if
holds himself to different standards and
therefore should have applied those
standards
let's listen into what those standards
were listening this is kg while back in
time
[Music]
um
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
the renovation
is so much
uh let's open this up to our viewers
also ramnikman is here with us and Dr
Rahman is also here with us but first
our viewers Captain AK Singh calling in
from jabalpur thank you Captain for
holding the line for this long good
evening sir your view okay good evening
what I suggest with all this details
coming out in your show yeah there's a
requirement for forensic audit because
foreign because if you see the the
entire cost of the house The major
portion goes in purchase of the land
land is costliest the construction of
house is pretty low compared to the
entire project so I suggest we should go
for forensics okay Captain Singh is
asking a very pertinent question one of
those big questions what documented
concerns prompted a rupees 45 crore
renovation was a structural audit
commissioned to certify the need for a
renovation who conducted that structural
audit what were the findings of that
audit what was the cost that was
recommended for this particular
renovation
viewers why wasn't the renovation
stopped when the doac red flagged the
project did the PWD seek the sanction of
their requisite authorities for the
project
can all these details be made public in
the interest of transparency remember
viewers when they raise questions about
the central Vista project they went to
the Supreme Court every detail had to be
furnished by the government on what
basis did PWD shortlist materials
required for Innovation why did we need
this Dior Pearl marble and these glitzy
closets
and these most expensive blackout
curtains
srinivasa Bengaluru srinivasan from
Bengaluru calling us Mr srinivasan good
evening
you're part of the times now family have
your say sir
yeah good evening actually I am I don't
know whether to say good evening after
hearing this shocking news as a taxpayer
I have two doubts number one is is the
house his own or is it government
Bungalow number two hey it looks like
these people are a wolf and sheep's
clothing number three they I still
remember there is the difference between
him and he was telling the Congress is
very very corrupt and all that I
remember a few years back before the
Modi government came that the Planning
Commission had made Europe close
together what of toilets right and uh as
far as Mr is concerned let me tell you I
am a teacher a very poor teacher and
where the money comes from for BJP
people like me pay 100 200 rupees it is
not uh you can't without knowing facts
please don't tell it thank you well
there you go viewers there's a lot of
indignation tonight
thank you salute you sir for holding
this long sorry to have kept you waiting
please go ahead sir good evening Rahul
uh thanks for taking me on uh first and
foremost Mystic Mr casual lies through
his teeth okay and I don't know how the
Delhi people are voted him to power
maybe because of the previously offered
for I have not for the not only for the
people for himself given previously in
this form
and uh I want to talk about Mr Sanjay I
don't know how you bring him on to this
panel every other time a suspended
person like just got nothing else to
talk about but
where there's no proof they are not
given any uh concrete evidence at all
but is it just keep talking you know
he's he's just into devotionary tactics
that's it okay dilatory diversity well
you know sir look
uh what can I say now uh but uh I I mean
hats off to uh Mr Sanjay jha he does
he does like to rile up the public and
he likes to take it on his chin so well
whatever it is whatever it is he's dead
it hurts all BJP supporters oh my gosh
that's that's actually patronizing
that's not very nice that's that's the
truth as well that's not very nice uh is
it wrong to be a BJP supporter is there
some Terror organizer are these old
people terrorists
what Rahul what's short space how
right-sided they are but in India's
basic one of the biggest scams both 1947
they are like ignore it tightly ignore
it okay well sir
just just as an aside you know what said
about all this adani nonsense right he
said you shouldn't have held up
Parliament for so long yeah okay Mr
Kohli you want to say something for a
minute yes I'm going to bring in
ramnikman also calling in this evening
just Dr Raman is also there yes Mr Cody
we should respect someone say this yeah
someone came in with a statement that
person is just like Mr Sanjay xiaomi a
citizen of the country he has a point of
view he's being open about that point of
view and saying I voted for so and so
there may be others who may be voting
for The Congress respect his point of
view You can disagree but don't let me
tell you viewers in that you remember
Hillary Clinton viewers Hillary Clinton
called the voters in America a basket of
deplorables and they put her in the
rubbish bin of history
you must remember this viewers don't let
people don't let people patronize you
she got more you remember
Mr Rajesh Khanna the legendary actor one
second
when the script was written for him what
he said
let's not be contemptuous of those that
built our democracy because let's not do
that you know these people will do that
to you Rahul you should vote for who you
want to vote after assessing the facts
and I think viewers at times now
families are very well very well
educated Dr Ramen one second please your
you know Dr Baga is calling in Dr bagai
go ahead according in from New Delhi
good evening sir go ahead
oh we lost him we lost man let me open
this Abraham and Dr Raman ramnikman
what's happening to the ahmadmi party
how do you assess this where's this
coming from this uh
entry into latin's culture
good evening Rahul and everybody on the
panel you see from uh traveling in an
auto rickshaw in Ahmedabad while he
lands from a private jet and then gets
onto a helicopter I mean the man is full
of hypocrisy from his oversized shirts
to his Reynolds 0.45 pen in his pocket
which costs rupees seven and to a 45
crore you know house renovation with his
socks and sandals and you know his uh
famous claim of 11 Mufflers of the 45
crore residents that he lives in so you
know there is a lot of things that can
be said about him these are the same
people who are talking about the slaka
suit and they have art lock
so I mean Kalin bhaiya has got 20 lakh
rupees worth of Kali engineer's home so
what can you say about kejriwal and
Sanjay's I don't know if he's living in
a parallel universe or what but you know
you have an obsession for Modi you need
to understand that 10 janpat is larger
than seven Lok Kalyan mug you know the
exact size is about 15 200 square meters
versus 14 100 square meters if we start
talking about the amount of money being
spent on renovating Sonia Gandhi's
Palace you will know have no answers to
it
five minutes for my turn please please
so you know from from this you know
three
[Music]
she is exposed
well hypocrisy is exposed Dr Rahman
would you agree
would you at least agree tonight that
Dua see many authorities not even
consulted yeah Rahul
yeah Rahul uh uh I want to make two or
three quick points and the first point
is I want to know of the files regarding
this renovation was sent to the LG
whether they were actually approved in
any form and if so what were the dates
and who was the LG who signed them off
and so on so that's Point number one
because considering the LG has been
having problems with many of the schemes
of the Delhi government we need to
figure out what he thought about this
renovation if he approved them indeed
why did he approve them which also makes
him culpable in this whole story
second I hate to do water boundary but
in this case the irony of renovating
what was an old building completely into
new uh into new shape yes 45 crore does
sound excessive but if you sort of
compare it with two trips with the cost
the Karnataka government has spent on
two trips of the Prime Minister one on
February 27 to belgavi and shivamoga and
another on I think it was the 12th of
March to dharwad one of them cost 36
crore and one of them cost nine plus
crore so that itself is 45 crore
including on one of those trips 86 lakh
was spent on lunch okay four crores were
spent on another trip on putting up a
stage stage was put up for four crore we
are not talking of security Arrangements
we are not talking about Air transport
and all that which is talking about the
area the cost for these visits at the
places concerned so let's be very clear
yes 45 crore does seem excessive but if
we are doing an audit of this 45 crore I
would expect Rahul shiv Shankar to have
a separate debate where he would raise
these questions why was a four and a
half crore stage required why was 86
lakhs spent on lunch why was 45 crores
spent on two visits so I think that
these are the questions that I'd love to
see Rahul shiv Shankar asking just like
he asked very valid relevant questions
to arvind kejriwal questions need to be
asked to everyone else too not just to
the Armani party wonderful Sir Mr
kejriwal needs to answer why he has
ordered this pending if indeed he is
aware that these kind of humongous
amounts have been spent and also the
point of view of what the LG felt of
this whole issue I think Rahul at least
that I'm sure you will well remember
find out and let them remember viewers
these documents very clearly beno's
signature of the LG
this matter will not even race with the
duaac how can I respond to this yes of
course Mr Cody one second this matter is
not even brought to the notice of the
duac viewers
I don't know we'll check with the LG of
course we'll check we'll find out for Dr
Raman but how does that in any case
viewers take away from the hypocrisy of
it all I don't know but nonetheless Mr
Kohli you should respond to the pointed
questions that Dr Rahman is asking about
the trips undertaken by the Prime
Minister campaigning
I must compliment him for doing exactly
what kejriwalji does when he's asked
questions on the liquor scam in Delhi
you'll ask him answer on the liquor scam
or the excise cam he'll say money say
sorry has done very good work in
education you'll ask him anything else
he'll answer separately let's come
straight to this
show me one political leader in India
BJP Congress any other party I'm saying
in every party
who says one thing on camera before
people and does exactly the opposite I
suggest you run each and every statement
of Mr kejriwal and show later on when
confronted how he does it it's available
on social media people laugh at it okay
from you this I'm expected from you Dr
Aman because we've always had straight
debates but I'm not going to allow
somebody to over talk over me yeah so
let me go again show me one political
leader who says
I will not go with the Congress goes
with the Congress the next day show me
one political leader who says I will say
go in my wagonr then takes Another Day
show me one political leader who says
he goes and stays in it and spends 45
crores you see it to the point between
me after statement after statement okay
the point has been made it's a challenge
but you still haven't answered okay fair
enough sir fair enough answer the
question fair enough fair enough one
minute in May 2020 Manish sisodia said
that Delhi government has no money to
pay salaries and asked
the center
to extend
to the ahmadmi party government rupees
5000 crores exactly the same period of
time where this expense was being
undertaken so because that tells you
something
we'll have more answers for you the
story is not going away it's going to
get bigger uh Dr ranganathan last 20
seconds I have no more time you were
raising your hand yeah very very quickly
it is quite sick that all this happened
number one during the times of the covet
I think we're forgetting that important
Point number two uh Dr Suman Raman said
that I uh I hate to indulge in water
boundary and then goes on to do exactly
that it's like saying I hateuras but
then gorge on 10 Shola baturas and
lastly you know sarojini Naidu very
famously said that it takes a lot of
money to keep Gandhi poor but here
kejriwal has done one better it's almost
like Gandhi was wearing only a language
walks you into the sabarmati ashram
opens the drawers and you see Gina like
Seville raw jackets well I leave it to

this who once swore to live a life of
Simplicity and austerity seems to have
been totally waylaid by the high life of
power and the corridors of power yes
ladies and gentlemen arvind kejriwal has
spent not one not two
not three or five or ten he spent 45
crore rupees on the renovation of his
chief ministerial Bungalow in Delhi yes
ladies and gentlemen it's a 45 crore
secret that has been uncovered by times
now nav Bharat and these are the
documents that I hold in my hand
just a fledgling small sister Channel
times now navdhara has done an
investigation and got these bills and
work orders of
amazing expenditure that has been
incurred on the chotasa or katwala Ghar
for the chief minister
today
this super exclusive on the news are
tonight will show you how the ahmadmi in
Delhi has been tricked and literally
literally
shown a different version of what the
ahmadmi party set out to be
it's no longer an armed chief minister
it is
Chief Minister who has spent 45 crore on
the renovation of his Bungalow this at a
time when covet was at the peak the
expenditure list is from September of
2020 when this city the entire country
was facing the worst pandemic in a
century when people were sitting in a
lockdown when all workers had to leave
the capital and go home to their
Villages when huge politics was made
about daily Wagers having to leave the
city at that time construction activity
was going on and bills were being
cleared bill's worth crores and crores
of rupees even during the Delta wave of
covet when the ahmadni was scrambling
for oxygen for beds and medicines and Mr
kg1 was calling out the center saying
that they didn't have a proper oxygen
strategy raising questions
at the same time there was renovation
activity of crows that was going on in
his own house but the Delhi chief
minister was busy building his mansion
let me tell you ladies and gentlemen the
45 crore rupees the warping 5 crore
rupees rupees spent to renovate and
beautify six Flagstaff road residents of
Mr arvind kejriwal nearly three crore
rupees were splurged in fact even more
than that about four crore rupees was
splurged in getting yes marble from
Vietnam called Dior pearl white marble
from Vietnam which costed crores of
rupees and polishing just a thousand
square feet of that marble square meters
of that marble costed about 21 lakh
rupees and this was granted by the PW
Department PWD Department which
just incidentally falls under the
supervision of the chief minister
himself or so we are being told
approximately 25 one lakh rupees 60 000
was spent on just polishing this
Vietnamese marble
1.97 crore was spent on extra marble
work that was required because this 1.15
crore marble was not enough and not just
marvel
take a look at those documents curtains
curtains costed total of 23 curtains in
the house costed about a crore of rupees
again sanctioned by the PWD Department
eight curtains at 45 lakh rupees and 58
000 and another 15 cartons at about 51
000 rupees
let me also remind you ladies and
gentlemen this whole karcha on the
beautification of arvind kejriwal's
house was done with the taxpayers money
the Delhi chief minister did not have to
spend a dime on this renovation it was a
home for the chief minister after all
carpets costed nearly 20 lakh rupees not
just that superior quality inner work
costed about 11.3 crores superior
quality
paneled walls they were superior quality
pillars all of that together you know if
the bills add up to about 11 crores plus
all of them are here all between 2020
and 2022 when kovid was raging and not
just that
there were wardrobes there was kitchens
in fact two kitchens one on the ground
floor one on the first floor and the
kitchen costed together
63 lakhs 31 lakhs on the ground floor 32
lakhs on the top floor 63 lakhs There
the figures on your screen almost 64
lakh rupees
just on two kitchens
that's the kind of extravagance
and not not very cheap 40 lakh rupees
was spent on wardrobes in his house the
dresser in the bedrooms for the family
costed 40 lakh rupees
toilets
top of the art I mean you could be
actually looking at these fittings and
these costings could be out of any
interior decoration
magazine top of the line which is why
operation sheesh Mahal has sent Tremors

thank you
good evening and welcome you're watching
this special edition of the nation wants
to know I am padmaja Joshi and this is
Operation
you just heard the Delhi chief minister
arvind kejriwal talking about how he
believes only in living the simple life
simple living High thinking
but what you are about to see is his 45
crores secret of how lovely Dior Paul
marble was imported to Grace the flaws
of the chief Minister's residence of how
curtains were bought in the middle of
the covet pandemic some of these were
almost 8 lakh rupees each not eight lakh
for the whole house not 8 lakh to do up
his entire office and house one curtain
was for just eight lakh rupees shocked
don't be because this
of the iceberg in operation
shows to you of the next one are the cas
karcha of a cutter mandar
kattarama chief minister this is a times
noun of Bharat exclusive and layer by
layer we're now going to show you how
from floor
ceiling taxpayers hard-earned money was
splurged in the middle of a pandemic and
it's all here in black and white let me
first take you across to expose a number
one of operation sheeshmael we show you
how money was splashed and it's right
here let's take it one by one first we
have
the total amount spent on marble is one
crore 15 lakh rupees we've approximated
it one crore 15 lakhs 790 Rupees is the
actual amount which was spent on the
marble now when something is so precious
it's Dior marble it has been imported it
was brought in from Vietnam so naturally
to polish it honestly speaking perhaps
in this much amount which was spent just
on polishing you would perhaps do up the
entire flooring of your house twenty one
thousand twenty one lakh 60 000 was
spent only on the polishing of this
marble and that is not all in addition
to this there was extra marble work that
was done subsequently here so the extra
marble work was separate initially you
had one crore 15 lakhs that was
initially sanctioned and then there was
a extra marble work because it's a
massive house Six Flag Staff Road the
chief Minister's residence so there was
a bit of a shortfall you thought all
right let's get in some more almost two
crores subsequently being spent which
brings us to the final expense that was
done on just the flooring just the
marble flooring that was done for six
Flagstaff house and it comes up to a
whopping hold your breath it comes up to
a whopping three crores 33 lakhs here
you have total spent on marble initially
was one crore 15 lakhs for polishing
21 lakh 60 000 was spent and an extra
marble work you had another one crore 97
lakhs being spent which adds up to a
whopping three crores 33 lakhs 88
000. can you even imagine three crores
simply on doing up the flaws now let's
show you in black and white where this
expense has come from here
right here the initial
here the Dior Pearl marble can we please
show the document the Dior Pearl marble
stone for flooring 1000 square meters is
right here at one crore 15 lakhs you
have it right here one crore 15 lakhs
this is where we have it in the
documents and in the polishing 21 lakh
rupees right here has been done so this
is where you have it
in documents this was sanctioned by the
public works department of the Delhi
government in the year 2020. now that
year should strike a note with you why
because that is when the first wave of
covid hit and that is when all of this
money was being sanctioned this is just
part one of the amount that was
sanctioned for buying the marble
it's not think about it all of us and
nobody is questioning whether the chief
minister should have good flooring of
course he's the chief minister of Delhi
but if you want to get a marble India is
known for some of the most beautiful
marble Rajasthan makrana marble some of
the most beautiful mansions have got
marble on their floors and it is brought
in from various parts of India what was
the need to get this Dior Pearl marble
all the way from Vietnam was there a
specific audit that said that no only
Italian marble must be put on the floors
of Six Flags half house that any other
marble will not be perhaps safe enough
was there a structural audit that was
done these are questions that I leave to
you so this is part number one
now let me come to part number two and
we are talking about it's a curtain
razor of sorts because now we are going
to talk about the curtains that were put
in the house here you have
curtain with fabric curtain track and
motor with track for both curtain first
floor plus balance of ground floor that
is middle room office room already
sanctioned this is the sheer curtain
that was sanctioned total curtains by
the way were 23.
curtains that were put up already in
2020 were it and the balance for which
already the budget has been sanctioned
is 15. the total amount sanctioned for
curtains is 97 lakhs so for 23 curtains
almost one crore rupees had been
sanctioned 97 lakhs of these eight were
delivered and these eight were worth 45
lakhs 58
000. 45 lakhs
for eight curtains that averages out to
more than 5 lakhs per curtain
wouldn't you love to see if you are the
taxpayer of the country wouldn't you I
would love to see what a five black
curtain looks like five lakh plus 45
lakhs for eight curtains definitely the
taxpayer deserves to know or at the very
least see what these gorgeous curtains
look like only eight were delivered so
far a total of 23 worth one crore have
been ordered now let's take you through
each one of these curtains because you
will understand the how exotic how
Exquisite these curtains are cost of
first curtain is above 5 lakh rupees the
cost of the second curtain is 6 lakh 22
000 rupees the rest of third curtain
which is 5 lakh 69 000 rupees now this
fourth curtain
must or rather should be really made of
marble or you know with like gilded with
gold or something because this curtain
is 7 lakh 94 000 rupees in seven lakh
you would get like a whole I don't know
you'll get like a whole drawing room
done up in like some very good Fabrics
but this one curtain is seven lakh
ninety four thousand the fifth curtain
is three lakh
57 000.
it's perhaps one of the most porous
curtains I don't know how they've mixed
and matched maybe like a seven lakh
really pretty curtain is paired off with
the three lakh not so gorgeous curtain
and then a five lakh 84 000 rupees
curtain that's the sixth one
and the seventh one also costs about six
lakh rupees so that's the breakup of
each of these curtains as they have been
delivered now we are talking about three
years ago and assuming that the rest of
the curtains would also have been
delivered by now keep this figure in
mind one crore rupees for putting up
approximately one crore slightly less
than one crore for putting up
23 curtains what was the logic uh also
remember that when you put in marble
flooring
you can argue that all right you know
everyone gets to use it this remember is
not to be occupied by Mr kejriwal alone
God forbid tomorrow somebody else when
some other party comes in power the next
person who's in the chief Minister's
residence will also make use of that
marble floor and you know the the
wardrobes if you will but curtains
one crore on curtains Alone look at this
Splurge how does all of this get
answered joining us now is a natural
editor matadas gopalakrishnan joining us
live mother do you have any word on what
was the rationale for this exhaustive
renovation remember Mr kejriwal hadn't
moved it often what happens is that you
know somebody else is there it happens
in civil services it happens in the Army
somebody else has been living there then
you want to Spruce it up a little bit
he's already been staying there for a
few years by 2020. what was the need of
the renovation then
you know at that time that these
Renovations were taking place we did get
in word that you know it is the chief
Minister's residence that they do end up
having to you know accommodate a lot
more people but if we just take a look
at these bills for a party that calls
itself the Ahmadi party is this the kind
of expenditure that any arm aadmi spends
on Home Improvement and the answer is a
resounding no you know but I was just
trying to wrap my head around the figure
of five lakhs or seven lakh rupees for a
curtain I'm just trying to make sense of
how or what really would be the material
or what really is it that would make a
curtain that sounds that makes it worth
five lakh rupees you know the most
expensive of fabric you know the most uh
the the most expensive of workman even
working on a curtain uh really what
could justify the cost of five lakh
rupees and what really has transpired
over here you know this is my reality
check five lakh is not even the most
expensive the most expensive one here is
7 lakhs 94 000. almost eight lakh rupees
for a curtain must be amazing fabric I
have to say
[Music]
yeah well absolutely that's that's the
whole point that I'm trying to make that
you know we have heard of home
improvements we have heard of lavix
expenditure you know at the taxpayers
expense uh mind you all of that
happening from a party as I was
mentioning which calls itself the Ahmad
party which had promised time and again
that its ministers would be staying in
flats and their frugality is something
that they have advertised time and again
but all of this happening in the midst
of kovid is really what raises the
entire issue of propriety when it comes
to this entire story and that is the
reason in public interest that we are
putting it out remember that this is a
time when Delhi was struggling for beds
they were struggling for oxygen they
were struggling for flat plates they
were struggling for medicine and at a
time like this we have this kind of
lavish expenditure Tran chapter tranche
of expenditure seven crores one crore
nine crores all of these branches that
are coming out for this kind of a luxury
Splurge okay as the chief ministers just
out of curiosity were there any
complaints raised about the condition of
the house which necessitated this kind
of overhaul mother
well that is normally the case of
padmaja that very often that they do
cite the fact that the house is not in
good condition but even if there was
some kind of reason for improvement what
can justify these kind of massive bills
that's a question that the Ahmadi party
will have to answer the people of Delhi
where they have been elected it is on
the basis of the public expenditure
public exchecker that this expenditure
has been occurred and therefore it is
incumbent for somebody who's a people's
representative to come and explain what
really necessary this kind of huge flood
because all of this happening in the
midst of covet raises some very very
serious questions yes a huge amount of
back and forth between the center
between the state about setting up you
know these massive temporary coveted
facilities there were a huge one at
chhattis
which had been set up and that too saw a
lot of back and forth between the center
and the state about resources about how
the state had only limited resources and
they need the center's help what about
resources that were then being poured
into the chief Minister's residence and
was that not in a way taking away from
what could have perhaps gone to the
Common Man in Delhi these are some very
important and some very basic questions
of the Ahmadi party will have to at some
point respond because it raises very
very serious questions about the kind of
governance about the kind of promises
that have been made and what has
ultimately been delivered by the rulers
of Delhi and here you have it here you
have it this is the document that shows
very clearly the kind of expenses that
were done on the curtains we've come
just to point number two of the kind of
expenses that we are talking about this
cannot be denied this cannot be Shrugged
off because it is all here in black and
white and at that time satendra Jain was
the PWD Minister if I'm not mistaken and
that is the time it is the timing really
that's what we are talking about you've
seen the kind of splurge that was done
on renovating the chief Minister's
Residence at Six Flags staff Road in
itself and we
again and again there is nothing illegal
but the question raised is about the
positioning that the ahmadni party
itself has done time and again the same
party has gone out and said but
the same people can argue that this
Bungalow will be used by all the future
Chief ministers the shocking thing is
the timing of this expenditure when
Delhi along with the rest of the country
was in the throes of covet crisis it's
at that very time that this money was
being sanctioned and spent on a Swanky
upgrade all the time when the amarnipati
was saying we don't have the wherewithal
to give oxygen and vaccines for people
of Delhi crows were being spent on
marble flooring on a dresser on curtains
the question is about propriety and
priorities
[Music]
the period between 2020 and 2022 is
burnt into the memory of Delhi Islands
because of people seeking oxygen beds in
short supply
migrants fleeing after running out of
money and food at the time something
else was happening
a renovation a refurbishment a redo and
it was being done for the man who runs
dead chief minister arvind kejriwal
what's shocking is that when Delhi was
suffering money was being pumped into
beautifying the Delhi Chief Minister's
official residence
on the 1st of September 2020 the Delhi
government sanctioned seven crore 91
lakh rupees for the cm's residence to be
renovated this is when the country was
battling the first wave of covert
on the 8th of June 2021 an additional
one crore 64 lakh rupees was sanctioned
this was when the second deadly covet
wave was at its peak remember it's at
this time when Delhi faced an acute
oxygen crisis
a third branch of nine crores 9 lakhs
were allocated on the 22nd of October
2021 at this time also the fight against
kovid wasn't over
for a party that has emphasized
frugality as its calling card this large
and its timing is mind-boggling what was
the need for such major spending what
was the need for such expensive marble
and carpets
what was the need what was the urgency
the question then is simple in the
middle of a pandemic what was the
priority of the Delhi government to save
lives of the Ahmad me or to upgrade
their own lives
your report thanks now
and that's a question that should be
answered by the ahmadni party and the
Delhi government and the chief minister
not to any channel but to the people of
the country to people of Delhi the
taxpayers of Delhi these are legitimate
questions that they need answers to now
let's come to part three you've already
seen the marbles and you've seen the
curtains now it's time to OK a look at
carpets carpets generally are an
expensive proposition mostly people who
are Discerning they will not buy things
which are synthetic the Discerning
people will go for Woolen carpets but
you know what are the really premium
kind of carpets hand tufted just like
any other handmade thing they are way
more luxurious they are soft they're
made of wool and they are also way more
expensive obviously for the chief
Minister's residents the very best was
brought in not one or two you had a
total of six hand tufted carpets that
were ordered they were put on the ground
and the first floor and a total cost of
19 lakhs 89 000 for
hand tufted carpets was incurred which
again brings it to an approximate of 3
lakh rupees per carpet nothing but the
best now let's take you through the
individual carpets and this is
fascinating for anyone who loves
Interiors you know when you really go
out on a limb and all of us everyone's
home proud right you're all house proud
you want to have the very best for your
house when you really want to spend you
would perhaps say I'll buy a 20 000
carpet kashmiri Carpets By the way which
are hand tufted would come to be say
about you know maybe a lack but these
have to be really quite something
because the first carpet some were put
on the ground floor some were put on the
first floor the first carpet is 5 0.53
lakhs the second carpet that was used in
the house was 3.95 lakhs the other one
was for 4 lakhs the fourth one was for
the total of six so the fourth third
carpet was four lakhs the fourth carpet
was also four lakh rupees the fifth
carpet was in the same range but
slightly lesser it was about 1.62 this
was you know more like an army type
carpet 1.62 and the sixth one was the
cheapest a mere 76 000 a pittance 76 000
so that is the total that was spent but
it all comes down to 19 lakh 89 000 20
lakh rupees which are spent just on
copper just to put things perspective in
20 lakhs in a tier 2 City you would
possibly get an Lig flat 20 lakh Rupees
is not a small amount you could get an
entire Lig flat in a tier 2 City but
here we've got six carpets operation
sheesh Mahal already being noted all
over the country questions being asked
let's get in the first reaction that
we're getting right now from the
bhartiya janta party let's listen
area
um
all right again joining us live now
already we've got the first reaction
coming in from the BJP we are also told
that the local uh District president of
the BJP in the area where there is the
chief Minister's residence has also
reached the spot over to you pragya is
there any reaction yet from the ahmadmi
party from the BJP
we are here
also for a leader who got elected on par
on promise of not having Bungalows not
taking cars you know it seems to have
reached a point where he doesn't even
don't just only need a bungalow but he
need a palatial and upgraded one you
know there are charges of impropriety
ethical Behavior obviously not
misappropriation of money but unethical
conduct CM casual had harped on
austerity for a very long time and
putting other political parties in dock
over misusing taxpayers money we still
remember how he waived documents over
documents saying that Sheila the then
chief minister had 10 essays in her
Bungalow and how you know she he also
had named nitin gadkari for so many
reasons he had to apologize for making
unsubstantially charges on him and he is
the one who said we won't take Bungalows
cars or any luxurious items when voted
to par for the first time you know we
still remember the images padmaja when
their mlas for the first time came in
autos
scooters and other even cycles for that
matter to the assembly you know that was
the kind of the politics that he
projected himself for uh you know and I
let me just put few facts for you here I
was speaking to a very formal a former
Delhi government official who had lived
on the same road where kejriwa lives for
30 years and he told me that you know
against his uh just across his uh
Bungalow Palacio Bungalow is ambedkar
memorial it is the place where ambedkar
lived a very simple life exactly
opposite his residence that was in tata
still now and it was BJP government in
fact PM took initiative and repaired and
got it renovated and upgraded you know a
very stark contrast to the politics that
he has been propagating and also
promising the people you know the more
than all of the political parties it is
the arm army voter who must be in the
shock today because they voted them to
par on promise of a change
a different politics a politics that is
divide of corruption
misappropriation and the promised a
politics of welfare measures improving
the lives of poor people and all that
has gone down the drain today with these
starting facts I think these the voters
are the people who are cheated who must
be feeling cheated today and must be in
shock and also uh you know for to put
few facts in perspective
the the place where uh cm arvind arvind
kejriwal is I have been told that it
used to be Chief secretary's home for a
very long time and it has been renovated
expanded uh you know few of the officers
had to I think they had to clear the
space for the expansion and also where
the speaker lives sahib Singh Verma who
was the then chief minister former chief
minister of Delhi used to live and he
used to live in a very simple Bungalow
unlike the one Palestine that we are
seeing today so they have said but you
know this is the height of hypocrite see
that BJP is exposing today they are also
demanding resignation from Chief
Minister for divine for ditching their
people
and and here's the things that people
are held up to their own standards we
are saying this right since the
beginning that anyone
deserves to be in a house that befits
your stature but every single time the
Darwin kejriwal has spoken he has said
which is
and then to see that this expenditure is
happening in the time of a pandemic in
the time when questions were being asked
that oh what about pmks fund where's
that money going we need more money we
need more oxygen generators we need more
oxygen plans
that is what needs to be focused on stay
with me pragya now we're going to talk
about after the carpet the marble and
the curtains you come from the CC you
come to the K because the kitchen is
really the heart of anyone's house
anyone will tell you that when you've
done up your living room nicely you want
to go that extra mile in your kitchen
you want to have you know a nice little
fridge you want to have a nice kitchen
countertop you end up spending a lakh
maybe two lakhs when you do like a
modular kitchen for us middle class
folks we're like I want to set aside
five six lakhs just for a nice modular
kitchen with a nice marble top a veneer
finish let's take a look at what
happened in the chief Minister's
residence there
kitchen's there one is on the ground
floor the other is on the second floor
so off
31 lakh rupees
2000.
2000 rupees that is the ground floor
kitchen the second floor kitchen though
is slightly better it's at 32 000 32
lakhs natural instinct is to go into
thousands but sorry 32 lakhs 13 000
rupees that's as far as the second floor
kitchen is concerned which means the
total expenditure is more than half a
crore it stands at 60 3 lakhs 75
000 rupees metaphorically speaking
eating away at the taxpayers money more
reactions coming in right now from a
sitting BJP MLA the course now is going
is growing about an explanation
will there be an explanation was there
some kind of crime need of an immediate
refurbishment to be done that oh this
kitchen is falling apart it must be it
must be changed immediately at a at an
expense of 32 lakh rupees let's listen
foreign
foreign
[Music]
the first reaction now that we are
getting the big big news being watched
all over the country it's creating
Tremors all over the country because
this is not just about Delhi it is about
the kind of politics and the kind of
standards that are set and the hypocrisy
within those standards and that politics
first reaction from the Ahmad ni party
Member of Parliament
foreign
foreign
government asset foreign
foreign
Ty why
let's be very clear let's not compare
apples with oranges or apples with
watermelons
had no business spending 45 crores on
the renovation of his residence at the
expense of honest taxpayers Point number
one and point number two
project
the decision to have that up and running
has been upheld by none other than the
Supreme Court and let me also remind
raghav Chatta who seems to be
deliberately ignorant that way back in
2012 jerem Ramesh the then Congress
Minister had written to the death
speaker neera Kumar saying that the
existing Parliament building does not
comply with seismic zone for
requirements and the current central
Vista Building okay the renovation will
comply not only with seismic Zone 4 but
also seismic zone 5 required so that's
why rather is saying that is
foreign
foreign
legislative norms if your net worth is
only of fourth rows and you say
the only thing I own are 320 grams of
gold okay how is it that you are
renovating and spending on a house which
is almost 12 times your net worth okay
we'll take this one by one foreign
foreign
foreign foreign
foreign
foreign
[Laughter]
let's talk about the nitty-gritties
entitlement
I said journalist as a person who has
put in 40 years in the profession I
congratulate times now team for bringing
out the scope and it is a very she smile
operation my understanding is should
comment on this now not say this is
the times now should send one camera to
another to get his reaction second thing
we are expecting a reaction from him
very soon
but he should resign and he should come
out of the house he must give the house
to a private six thousand square feet
total and you spend 45 crore that means
every square feet how much it costs what
is that the Colossal wastage of money my
understanding is the entitlement may be
there but you are also entitled for
certain luxuries but why should the
entertainment go out of the gear second
thing my understanding is carpet your
engagement is for carpet why do you have
this carpet of 75 lakhs Your
Entertainment is for kitchen why do you
go for the egg roll kitchen Your
Entertainment is for 19 lakh 89 000
whatever that why do you go for the 82
lakhs kitchen is 63 lakhs 75 000 just to
quickly correct you 63 like 75 000. what
is what is the entertainment you know as
a chief minister reach it's only 80 to
100 18 200 addiction expenses and
kitchen why should sahib Singh Varma
also decided that I used to meet him
there sahibzing Verma house and the
opposite to that is ambedkar's house
ambedkar will you know turn in his grave
yeah because if we learned that it is 75
45 crore rupees spent on their old house
America who lived a very simple life
okay
but before that I want to quickly turn
the page on operation sheesh Mahal and
go to the next part because now we are
talking about
walls now again talking from a very
middle class point of view when you do
your walls what is your basic expense
you think okay I'm going to put one
waterproof paint or maybe something with
a satin finish and when you really get
fancy you say one wall will be a show
wall
that will cost us another twenty thirty
thousand now let's take a look at the
walls inside the chief Minister's
residence these walls are special walls
so you had two kinds of decorations done
over there decorative Interiors on walls
were worth 85 lakhs 76
000. so you had decorative Interiors on
walls 85 lakhs 76 000 that was part one
and in the second part you had more
decorative Interiors which were worth
three crores 51 lakhs now I'm just
wondering these decorative Interiors are
just what we in common people's language
called pop like there is one plaster of
Paris or a fall ceiling or does this
include paintings I have no idea because
three crores is a hell of a lot of money
and the total amount for prepare
fabricated artistic wood panel adds up
to four crores 37 lakhs 4.37 crore
rupees and then there is also artistic
Stone panel which cost an additional 58
lakhs 58 000.
houses and all of that what is this this
Cross of wall panels
what is this cross worth of wall
paneling
yeah
open up that house let the times now
camera five cameras go there and take a
picture that's all okay take a video you
cannot explain to this
I have also seen lots of I travel at
least several countries never seen such
a luxury Mr Robin you bro came to power
as me now you have become an Amir aadmi
this is not the way in which you should
you must come out of the house very
quickly tomorrow you must walk it as
Rahul Gandhi this is an open invitation
please I think more than us the people
of Delhi would love to see because it's
truly a thing of beauty if so much money
is being spent we should also get to see
Sanju Verma you should also get to see
everyone should get to see because maybe
you could pick up a few tips
version of this slightly cheaper but
maybe as beautiful Sanju Varma okay
I hate to say this but I have to make
one disclaimer here you know uh I stay
in a sea facing Penthouse in Mumbai in
one of the most expensive uh pieces of
property in India but I'm very proud to
say that you know I'm my multi-core
residence is entirely the work of my
hard-earned money having drawn
multi-million dollars worth of salaries
in mnc's before I joined politics so I
want to make one thing very clear
staying in a palatial house uh you know
decorating your house with the best
marble with the best curtains all that
is fine if you've been paying your taxes
legally and if you have that kind of
network which is built based on your
hard work and salary or business
when he joined politics I clearly
remember and I'm quoting from an article
written by Ellen Berry in New York Times
uh 14 February 2014 where he says I am a
very ordinary man I've decided to join
public life I Have Nothing by way of
savings or I do not have a single penny
I have not come here for power if I have
to give up the chief Minister's chair a
hundred times I will sacrifice it a
hundred times for the sake of my country
my only wishes
videos great lofty ideas he says he's
done you know an absolutely blemish free
brand of politics but this runs counter
to his own claims so we definitely are
expecting some kind of statement some
kind of clarification and at the very
least one sneak peek at these lovely
Interiors as well I have to take a very
quick break uh Sanju Varma both
Gentlemen please stay with me a very
quick break we're back in a minute

in time tonight to about 2012 August 3.
a time when arvind kejri was swore by
austerity
accountability and claim to Crusade for

uncorrupted by vvip culture kejriwal
vowed a New Politics
and he certainly talked the walk
Millions flocked to this new Messiah of
morality
no one believed kejriwal's gospel more
than kejriwal himself
he was the living embodiment of a simple
life the Muffler Man in unfashionable
square leg trousers and a bush shirt the
common man among common men a caricature
drawn by r.k lakshman himself perhaps
viewers
to real life perfection
he was
the living
antithesis of the VIP and VIP culture he
was the breadth of humility lacking in
Indian politics and among Indian
politicians
I told you viewers
that no one believed keijiwa's gospel
more than kejriwal himself and no one so
spread kejriwal's gospel more than
kejriwal himself listen to kejriwal in
his own words about his own Simplicity
austerity his own
simpleness listening
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I told you viewers I would take you back
I would take you back to a time when
arvind kejriwal swore by austerity
accountability and claimed to Crusade
for the ahmadmi
no one believed Casey was gospel more
than kejriwal himself
he was the living antithesis as I told
you viewers of the VIP
and VIP culture
but today that muffler man has been
seduced it would appear by the Creature
Comforts of the high life the latin's
life
or so it seems viewers
the fetish
for the drabness of a previan life have
long gone
today kejriwal prefers to spend a life
in the proverbial Ivory Tower given a
facelift at a whopping cost of rupees 45
crores all built to you the real tax
strapped care won ahmadmi viewers in
these pages
in these pages in my hand
is a record
is a record of this perk this 45
approximately 45 crore perk this perk
viewers is an old
is an Ode to insensitivity a Marie
antionet's proportion vanity project
undertaken undertaken at the peak of a
pandemic that left thousands of
delhiites gasping for oxygen begging for
beds and meds
it was even red flagged by a statutory
body the Delhi Urban Arts Commission
but kejriwal would Brook viewers no
opposition the perk was more important
it would appear
to him
than public welfare today it stands on
hundreds of square yards of Dior Pearl
marble walls causated in teak wood
customized with bathroom fittings and
closets and swaddled in curtains at a
cost that could have changed many lives
watch more viewers it isn't even clear
if this Ode to hypocrisy was ever
declared to the public viewers
I told you that this particular old
to ostentatiousness could have changed
many many lives I will walk you through
the statistics viewers I will walk you
through the statistics in just a short
while but let me first talk you through
the expense
I will talk you through the expense and
you will be shocked in these pages I
told you viewers the expenses are
detailed
and on your screens is the account
is the account the total money spent on
marble on this rare quality marble that
is imported viewers
this marble that is called Dior Pearl
marble
viewers a crore in 15 lakhs
the amount spent on polishing
21 lakhs
could have been spent viewers on
building
three homes
four homes
half a dozen homes under the Prime
Minister avas yojana but that money
viewers was spent on just polishing this
marble
this is a renovation we are not talking
about the construction of a new home
here 45 crores on a renovation
viewers
I'm not even sure
if the palace in which Marie Antoinette
lived
today
would cost 45 crores to renovate
what was this renovation it's completely
unprecedented
three crores 33 lakhs 88 000 spent on
installing marble
that's that's just the cost viewers of
the floor on which Mr kgwal now
walks on
luxurious
on viewers
this is not the only obscene expenditure
and all of these expenses were taking
place viewers when the ahmadmi party was
screaming about the fact that it had no
funds to supply you oxygen
to set up these accumulators
oxygen accumulators they said we have no
money we didn't even have money the
offset to buy vaccines
viewers this happened between 2020 and
2021 the two peaks
of the pandemic
the Delta pandemic viewers
the Delta pandemic left you
grasping
grasping
at any lifeline and gasping for the most
important one which is oxygen
and these people viewers were polishing
flaws at that time
so that Mr casual could walk
he could walk
into latin's ostentatiousness
this man viewers who said that he was
the very antithesis of it who drove
around in a wagon r
who was as I told you viewers
a common man among common men
that even r k lakshman
would have
been proud of drawing
this Muffler Man
in unfashionable square leg trousers and
a bush shirt
viewers
this was just the marble
let's talk about the next big Splurge
this next perk curtains viewers curtains
that most of us sort of change every two
or three years but no Mr keijiwal wanted
curtains 23 of them
how many have been put up eight have
been put up
curtains
for which the budget was sanctioned was
15 viewers total amount spent is almost
a crore
yes you as a crore
this beautiful palace that he lives in
is swaddled in almost a crore worth of
curtains viewers this was one curtain
raising Curtain Call
that even Amitabh Bachchan
would have been proud of taking
if you were acting in theater but this
is we basically viewers the theater of
the Absurd it really is
total amount of curtains that have
already been delivered 45 lakhs 58 000.
there are more to be installed viewers
how much more
how much more of the world you want to
block out Mr case you are
how much more of the world
do you want to block out sir
yes viewers
cost of the first curtain above 5 lakhs
second was six lakhs another one for
five lakh seven lakh three five six
three it just goes on and on
how much is being cloaked
well viewers
why would you want to cover a beautiful
marble floor with anything
why would you want to put any distance
between the soles of your feet and this
beautiful floor but for Mr kg while it
had to be it had to be six hand tufted
wool carpets were ordered carpets were
put on ground in the first floor total
cost was just 19 lakhs and 89 000.
viewers
six carpets were 20 lakhs the cost of
the first carpet was as you can see five
lakhs
the cost of the second almost four the
cost of the third four
it just goes on you can see the list 20
lakhs worth of carpets
viewers
let's now look at the kitchen
what's cooking in Mr kejriwal's
renovated Palace the sheesh Mahal as we
call it viewers
the ground floor kitchen
look at the money
31 lakhs the second floor kitchen 32
lakhs total expenditure 63 lakhs viewers
on two kitchens
these are all Renovations we'll have
several questions of course
there may be nothing illegal there may
be nothing illegal about any of this we
are not even for a moment suggesting it
is I don't know of course
if permissions were sought we certainly
can tell you that the Delhi Urban Arts
commission at Red Flag they're saying
that you shouldn't be spending this
but they were too late even they didn't
know
the renovation already begun
why it wasn't halted after the doac
raised a red flag I can't say that's for
the ahmadmi party to answer but right
now viewers they're hiding behind this
sort of species argument that look other
politicians spend a lot more no viewers
other politicians didn't go out there
saying that we hold ourselves to higher
standards that we are the arm among the
ahmadmi no viewers they don't say that
it can even be argued viewers that this
is a bungalow to be used in posterity by
our chief minister respect to what party
they belong to
but what is shocking is the timing of
this expenditure when Delhi along with
the rest of India was in the throes of
the covet crisis
the Delta moment money was spent on a
Swanky upgrade on Mr keizer's house at
the time when the ahmadmi party was
saying they don't have enough money and
where with all to provide oxygen and
vaccines for people of Delhi crores were
being spent on this Monumental frippery
viewers
the impropriety of this expenditure goes
here's what we mean
[Music]
accused of people seeking oxygen beds
and shots applied
migrants fleeing after running out of
money and food at the time something
else was happening in there
a renovation a refurbishment a redo and
it was being done for the man who runs
Delhi chief minister arvind kejriwal
what's shocking is that when Delhi was
suffering money was being pumped into
beautifying the Delhi Chief Minister's
official residence
on the 1st of September 2020 the Delhi
government sanctioned seven crore 91
lakh rupees for the cm's residents to be
renovated this is when the country was
battling the first wave of covet
on the 8th of June 2021 an additional
one crore 64 lakh rupees were sanctioned
this was when the second deadly covet
wave was at its peak remember it's at
this time when Delhi faced an acute
oxygen crisis and migrants exodus
a third branch of nine crores 9 lakhs
were allocated on the 22nd of October
2021 at this time also the fight against
kovid wasn't over
the party that has emphasized frugality
as its calling card splurge and its
timing is mind-boggling what was the
need for such major spending what was
the need for such expensive marble and
carpets what was the need what was the
urgency the question then is simple in
the middle of a pandemic what was the
priority of the Delhi government to save
lives of the ahmadmi or to upgrade their
own lives
build a report that's not
Mr casual somewhere along the line also
acquired a deep love for the fine things
in life viewers and therefore
decorations
on
on the walls
viewers
paneling wood paneling teak wood
paneling
and of course curios Antiquities Etc all
needed to be
put in and I can show you a picture
nitish Kumar recently called upon arvind
keju Allen they sat in what appears to
be one of the anti-rooms perhaps even a
reception room viewers I don't know
but all these decorative
Interiors this entire refurbishment
has caused three crores 51 lakhs
decorative Interiors
the decorations on the walls 85 lakhs
must obviously viewers include paintings
and the like and all sorts of other
things if you can just put the
photograph of that meeting on one side
it would be very good
uh we're also opening this up to you
viewers
kejriwal gets a car shop
and the question that we've asked is a
very simple one
it's not one of those extremely
complicated ones there's this 45 crore
perk tent kejriwal's
status it's very simple one viewers we'd
like to hear from you
you're our family times now is family
and I know you're tuned in tonight and
you would perhaps have an opinion
positive negative doesn't matter Bring
It On viewers
uh
there's also of course
this entire Four Color 37 lakh
expenditure on Curiosities and those are
the pictures and it looks I must say
quite swanky
I mean this really
is the as I told you viewers this is uh
these are fripperies
of a Mary Antoinette proportion
as I told you viewers a little early
in the show
I mean
this really is an escape from the
drabness of the plebeian life
then Mr kejriwal
really championed
so a lot has changed a lot has changed
in this Ivory Tower which has been given
this beautiful facelift
beautiful facelift
there are also of course viewers closets
yes there are closets there is other
Furniture I mean these closets
themselves viewers are stunningly
expensive
um
for public cars for
cars in the closet I don't know I can
come up with many puns tonight but the
dresser in the chief Minister's bedroom
is just about eight lakhs that's more
than the price really of two the cost
rally of two
homes that could have been built for the
poor under the PM awas yojana
so here's the dresser itself the
Wardrobe in the chief Minister's parents
bedroom
five and a half lakhs the dresser in the
chief Minister's parents bedroom five
and a half lakhs the Wardrobe in the
chief Minister's sun room 7 lakhs 92
000.
yes viewers
I mean the Wardrobe is that expensive it
must really be protecting
some very
some very very
clothing also
the cm's daughter at 3 lakhs 88 000
wardrobe in the first floor bedroom 4
lakh 66 000 wardrobe in the second floor
three lakhs into five so the five
wardrobe so that's about 15 lakhs total
spend is 40 lakhs now let me tell you
viewers had this money been spent on
other things what could it have bought
had had the chief minister really been
public spirited at that time of need
he spent 45 crores viewers working about
subsidies for 1685.
people
ews and low income group beneficiaries
would have got these subsidiaries I mean
you could have really changed their
lives transform their lives 1685
families could have been living
a very different life viewers
a six lakh loan to 750 people in ews in
low income strata and you know viewers
how these loans have been repaid so the
loans really set you upon a different
cost in life 4500 could have been given
one lakh for rehabilitation each
twelve thousand four hundred fifty nine
oxygen concentrators could have been
bought at the height of the pandemic
when the ahmadmi party was saying we
don't have the money
viewers 2 lakh 25 000 PPE kids could
have been bought to protect doctors and
other caregivers at that time
2710 oxygen ventilators could have been
bought
a whopping 22 lakh doses of Kobe Shield
vaccine could have been purchased by the
Delhi government 15 of Kovacs in 15 lakh
doses of covaxine could have been
purchased 4 500 hospital beds could have
been set up by the government viewers
you remember the positive beds at that
time
180 classrooms for 7 200 students in a
government School
7200 and students could have been
getting an education today viewers
there are some big questions and we're
going to pose those big questions but

point that I'm trying to make that you
know we have heard of home improvements
we have heard of lavix expenditure you
know at the taxpayers expense uh mind
you all of that happening from a party
as I was mentioning which calls itself
the Ahmadi party which had promised time
and again that its ministers would be
staying in flats and their frugality is
something that they have advertised time
and again but all of this happening in
the midst of kovid is really what raises
the entire issue of propriety when it
comes to this entire story and that is
the reason in public interest that we
are putting it out remember that this is
a time when daily eyes was struggling
for beds they were struggling for oxygen
they were struggling for flat plates
they were struggling for medicine and at
a time like this we have this kind of
lavish expenditure Tran chapter tranche
of expenditure seven crores one crore
nine crores all of these crunches that
are coming out for this kind of a luxury
Splurge okay as the chief ministers just
out of curiosity were there any
complaints raised about the condition of
the house which necessitated this kind
of overhaul mother
well that is normally the case of
padmaja that very often that they do
cite the fact that the house is not in
good condition but even if there was
some kind of reason for improvement what
can justify these kind of massive bills
that's a question that the Ahmadi party
will have to answer the people of Delhi
where they have been elected it is on
the basis of the public expenditure
public exchecker that this expenditure
has been occurred and therefore it is
incumbent for somebody who's a people's
representative to come and explain what
really necessary this kind of huge flood
because all of this happening in the
midst of covet raises some very very
serious questions yes a huge amount of
back and forth between the center
between the state about setting up you
know these massive temporary coveted
facilities there were a huge one at
chhattis
which had been set up and that too saw a
lot of back and forth between the center
and the state about resources about how
the state had only limited resources and
they need the center's help what about
the forces that were then being poured
into the chief Minister's residence and
was that not in a way taking away from
what could have perhaps got to the
Common Man in Delhi these are some very
important and some very basic questions
of the Ahmadi party will have to at some
point respond because it raises very
very serious questions about the kind of
governance about the kind of promises
that have been made and what has
ultimately been delivered by the rulers
of Delhi and here you have it here you
have it this is the document that shows
very clearly the kind of expenses that
were done on the curtains we've come
just to point number two of the kind of
expenses that we are talking about this
cannot be denied this cannot be Shrugged
off because it is all here in black and
white and at that time satyendra Jain
was the PWD Minister if I'm not mistaken
and that is the time it is the timing
really that's what we are talking about
you've seen the kind of splurge that was
done on renovating the chief Minister's
Residence at Six Flags staff Road in
itself and we're saying this again and
again there is nothing illegal but the
question raised is about the positioning
that the ahmadni party itself has done
time and again the same party has gone
out and said but
the same people can argue that this
Bungalow will be used by all the future
Chief ministers the shocking thing is
the timing of this expenditure when
Delhi along with the rest of the country
was in the throes of covet crisis it's
at that very time that this money was
being sanctioned and spent on a Swanky
upgrade all the time when the ahmadni
party was saying we don't have the
wherewithal to give oxygen and vaccines
for people of Delhi crows were being
spent on marble flooring on a dresser on
curtains the question is about propriety
and priorities",True,en,34242,233,592

thank you
good evening and welcome you're watching
this special edition of the nation wants
to know I am padmaja Joshi and this is
Operation
you just heard the Delhi chief minister
arvind kejriwal talking about how he
believes only in living the simple life
simple living High thinking
but what you are about to see is his 45
crore secret of how lovely Dior Pearl
marble was imported to Grace the flaws
of the chief Minister's residence of how
curtains were bought in the middle of
the covet pandemic some of these were
almost 8 lakh rupees each not eight lakh
for the whole house not eight lakh to do
up his entire office and house one
curtain was for just eight lakh rupees
shocked don't be because this
of the iceberg in operation
suppose to you of the next one are the
cause karcha of a Qatar imandar cutter
ahmadmi chief minister this is a times
now navbharat exclusive and layer by
layer we're now going to show you how
from floor
ceiling taxpayers hard-earned money was
splurged in the middle of a pandemic and
it's all here in black and white let me
first take you across to expose a number
one of operation sheesh Mahal we show
you how money was splurged and it's
right here let's
one by one first we have
the total amount spent on marble is one
crore 15 lakh rupees we've approximated
it one crore 15 lakhs 790 Rupees is the
actual amount which was spent on the
marble now when something is so precious
it's Dior marble it has been imported it
was brought in from Vietnam so naturally
to polish it honestly speaking perhaps
in this much amount which was spent just
on polishing you would perhaps do up the
entire flooring of your house 21
000 21 lakh 60 000 was spent only on the
polishing of this marble and that is not
all in addition to this there was extra
marble work that was done subsequently
here so the extra marble work
you had one crore 15 lakhs that was
initially sanctioned and then there was
extra marble work because it's a massive
house Six Flag Staff wrote the chief
Minister's residence so there was a bit
of a shortfall you thought all right
let's get in some more almost two crores
subsequently being spent which brings us
to the final expense that was done on
just the flooring just the marble
flooring that was done for six Flagstaff
house and it comes up to a whopping hold
your breath it comes up to a whopping
three crores 33 lakhs here you have
total spent on marble initially was one
crore 15 lakhs for polishing
21 lakh 60 000 was spent and an extra
marble work you had another one crore 97
lakhs being spent which adds up to a
whopping three crores 33 lakhs 88
000. can you even imagine three crores
simply on doing up the flaws now let's
show you in black and white where this
expense has come from here you have
right here the in visual
here the Dior Pearl marble can we please
show the document the Dior Pearl marble
stone for flooring 1000 square meters is
right here at one crore 15 lakhs you
have it right here one crore 15 lakhs
this is where we have it in the
documents and in the polishing 21 lakh
rupees right here has been done so this
is where you have it
in documents this was sanctioned by the
public works department of the Delhi
government in the year 2020. now that
year should strike a note with you why
because that is when the first wave of
covid hit and that is when all of this
money was being sanctioned this is just
part one of the amount that was
sanctioned for buying the marble
the question simply arises now think
about it all of us and nobody is
questioning whether the chief minister
should have good flooring of course he's
the chief minister of Delhi but if you
want to get a marble India is known for
some of the most beautiful marbles
Rajasthan makrana marble some of the
most beautiful mansions have got marble
on their floors and it is brought in
from various parts of India what was the
need to get this Dior Pearl marble all
the way from Vietnam was there a
specific audit that said that no only
Italian marble must be put on the floors
of Six Flag Staff house that any other
marble will not be perhaps safe enough
was there a structural audit that was
that these are questions that I'll leave
to you so this is part number one
now let me come to part number two and
we are talking about it's a curtain
razor of sorts because now we are going
to talk about the curtains that were put
in the house here you have
sheer curtain with fabric curtain track
and motor with track for both curtain
first floor plus balance of ground floor
that is middle room office room already
sanctioned this is the sheer curtain
that was sanctioned total curtains by
the way were 23.
curtains that were put up already in
2020 were it and the balance for which
already the budget has been sanctioned
is 15. the total amount
sanctioned for curtains is 97 lakhs so
for 23 curtains almost one crore rupees
had been sanctioned 97 lakhs of these
eight were delivered and these eight
were worth 45 lakhs 58
000. 45 lakhs
for eight curtains that averages out to
more than 5 lakhs per curtain
wouldn't you love to see if you are the
taxpayer of the country wouldn't you I
would love to see what a five lakh
curtain looks like five lakh plus 45
lakhs for eight curtains definitely the
taxpayer deserves to know or at the very
least see what these gorgeous curtains
look like only eight were delivered so
far a total of 23 worth one crore have
been ordered now take you each one of
these curtains because you will
understand the how exotic how Exquisite
these curtains are cost of first curtain
is above 5 lakh rupees the cost of the
second curtain is 6 lakh 22 000 rupees
the rest of third curtain which is 5
lakh 69 000 rupees now this fourth
curtain
should be really made of marble or you
know with like gilded with gold or
something because this curtain is 7 lakh
94 000 rupees in seven lakh you would
get like a whole I don't know you would
get like a whole drawing room done up in
like some very good Fabrics but this one
curtain is seven lakh ninety four
thousand the fifth curtain is three lakh
50 seven thousand
it's perhaps one of the most poorest
curtains I don't know how they've mixed
and matched maybe like a seven lakh
really pretty curtain is paired off with
the three lakh not so gorgeous curtain
and then a five lakh 84 000 rupees
curtain that's the sixth one
and the seventh one also costs about 6
lakh rupees so that's the breakup of
each of these curtains as they have been
delivered now we are talking about three
years ago and assuming that the rest of
the curtains would also have been
delivered by now keep this figure in
mind one crore rupees for putting up
approximately one crore slightly less
than one crore for putting up
23 curtains what was the logic uh also
remember that when you put in marble
flooring
you can argue that all right you know
everyone gets to use it this remember is
not to be occupied by Mr kejriwal alone
God forbid tomorrow somebody else when
some other party comes in power the next
person who the chief Minister's
residents will also make use of that
marble floor and you know the the
wardrobes if you will but curtains
everyone changes curtains people
sometimes change their curtain every
year to send one crore on curtains Alone

get answered joining us now is natural",True,en,95852,751,1730

students there and let me ask Dr Sanjay
jha Dr Sanjay jha
in the issues that it's picking up
uh navika just two short points number
one
the entire survey will be put to test in
a few weeks
we will get to get to know in Karnataka
on May 13th whether the people have
really stuck and I'm talking about
people at large the real voters not
those who have participated in this
survey as to what they really think on
all these issues and I can tell you that
answer is going to be a remarkable
contrast to what this survey company is
currently broadcasting and my simple
Point here is this when I look at the
data of 69 percent of people roughly
siding with the Gotham adani issue I
you that end of day in four
th adani went for being the SEC the sex
man in the world down to below 30s and
that was the people of not just India
but the people of people of the entire
world who agreed that there was
something very very fishy on the growth
of Gotham adani and its proximity to him
before you convince the rest of the
country
is entirely entitled to his own opinion
but I can tell you he cannot
unfortunately control the Indian or the
global stock markets okay that's that's
he's got his fundamental right to his
private yeah but that's what people
believe that it was a it was a strike by
the international toolkit aided and
abated by some people here to do this as
a strike to reduce an Indian's wealth
well adani adani may be a name doesn't
go down well with the congress party but
it is Indian wealth at the end of the
day that got destroyed how about that
question
well you know Navica I normally never
try and criticize any survey report
because it
has got its own merits in whatever they
have done but I need to say this very
honestly when I look at some of the data
points I hope the surveyor hasn't done
this entire shall we say sampling in
some secluded part of nagpur because I
think it looks ridiculously jaundice
unbiased defense
spectacular is a joke
smiling and as as is my friend tanveer
Ahmad both smiling you're getting Smiles
up from Hyderabad and from Bengaluru no
support only smile they'll give you
let's find out let's find out if the
support is accompanying the smile so
Karthik ready why don't you go first why
are you smiling do you think the issues
picked up by Mr Rahul Gandhi are
actually avoiding issues of the people
and therefore do not find traction
is somehow somewhere I believe too that
Rahul Gandhi picks up quite trivial
matters but that's not the matter I was
smiling about when you were discussing
the adani matter with Sanjay Bhai
um and quoting the survey which you just
mentioned about it kind of bought a
checker to my face because somewhere I
believe we Indians are trusting the
adani corporation more than gothan adani
himself the reason I say this Mr Gautama
madani has threatened to go to court
against the Hindenburg company and also
the Financial Times paper or whatever
article they have written until today he
has not filed any legal cases against
the two biggest hit jobs that we call
against Gautam adani we Indians somehow
trust the adani corporation more than
Gautama himself but again navikaji
coming back to the larger picture that
you were talking we were talking about
the coming elections let me tell you
history is pestered by a commonality
where men had been bought down defeated
by the fallacy of invincibility I can
give you multiple examples I can give
you examples of Hitler himself I can
give you examples of Margaret Thatcher
and recent examples I can give you
examples of trump when everybody and all
pre people surveys believed that Trump
would come back and we all know what
happened how Biden came back we also
know what happened in a few years before
when rajapaksheps used an election since
Sri Lanka before he came back now that
is where he lost an election to an
absolute nobody see navikaze I can also
give an example of vajpayji when the you
remember the India shining campaign
where everyone believed that BJP would
come back the NDA would come back see
now because history has is has many
stories like this where men have been
followed by the fallacy of invincibility

Mumbai finally came to an end on 26th of

the first Tata wpl trophy Drive was
conducted in the City of Dreams Mumbai
which commenced from Norman point and
saw a crowd of more than 200 people
present to support and share the data
Women's Premier League
[Music]
I think it's a brilliant platform that
the women are getting and we've come a
long way and it's uh it's like uh
something full of Pride that finally
it's your and it's motivating me to get
into Cricket personally I have been
waiting for this since very long and I'm
quite excited along with that I also
look forward to matches where uh men and
women play together so I would really
appreciate tata for the same because the
reason is they're giving an amazing
platform to the women's and which is
very very required in this time seeing a
lot of energy everywhere with so many
beautiful women so yeah woman power is
always there
[Music]
a former international cricket player
was present at the venue and interacted
with the crowd
so this has been a long long awaited
step and I'm so glad it's come at this
point because women's Cricket is taking
shape there are a lot of youngsters who
are choosing to play the sport and the
wpl has just gonna boost this um women's
Cricket to a new level and I think 100
plus cricketers from India and abroad
are competing in this wpl and I'm sure
it's going to be a massive success and
present a good career option for
youngsters who are looking to pursue a
career in cricket
[Music]
actress Vani Kapoor also made an
appearance at the event and engaged with
the audience
should women be empowered in every sport
I don't think that there's any field
that they lack behind they're just so
good at it
so I don't want to be biased right now
but I do believe from Mumbai Indians
because she's very good I've heard a lot
of amazing things about her
she then kick-started the trophy drive
by waving the checkered flag
the trophy Convoy was accompanied by 10
more cars all decked up to raise
awareness about the Women's Premier
League
I'm super happy to be a part of this
such a beautiful women's drive it's an
excellent feeling and supporting the
Indian team and supporting India women
itself is a great thing we're offering
top of the wall is for women empowerment
it is so empowering and enthusiastic
that you know these kind of drives are
being prominent and people are
participating early morning and Women's
Premier League I'm super excited for
this one taking partner rally like this
brings in the solidarity and the and the
strength of what women can really
achieve it's absolutely fantastic I'm
Feeling Fabulous
the cast departed from nariman point
drove past the pictures khaji Ali and
then sipped through the band roverly
ceiling
the Convoy then made its first pit stop
at Carter Road bandra
when everyone was greeted by RJ shardul
who showed a lot of excitement for the
coveted trophy along with the tournament
[Music]
[Applause]
I think uh anytime a league is you know
brought in like we all know what
happened with Cricket when uh
the small Max just started getting
played as a league and I think women's
Cricket finally now deserves uh the
money the endorsements and the
viewership the women players have been
doing a kick-ass job
the Convoy then made its second halt at
mallat's in orbit mall where a modest
setup was laid out for a fun interactive
session with the fans everybody was
invited from Young Cricket fans to women
more goers to play box Cricket wherein
participants not only got a chance to
score big but also win some exciting
prizes
we foresee more people to participate in
this and it should be as famous as men's
Cricket it's been an absolute Joyride
it's great seeing the excitement of
people everywhere we are going through
the streets of Mumbai with the trophy
and it's so nice to see people pointing
at it and saying
so really the adrenaline is giving us a
great high and I feel this is a
wonderful platform for women cricketers
to really put their best talent forward
and I hope this does fantastically for
women's Cricket not just for the Women's
Premier League which of course is the
stepping stone to even greater stuff I
had the experience today has been insane
the entire energy level all the way from
Marine Drive Kapoor coming in the crowds
there's so much excitement all along
when we were driving from Marine drive
all the way to Ali bands and there
were people who were following the cars
and people thinking you know rolling
down their windows and taking videos all
over people are actually stopping and
asking is this only the trophy today so
the entire excitement on the road was
insane I loved it I had so much fun I'm

much enthusiasm among the people the

large number of people participated in
the Box Cricket Challenge and a fun
Cricket based quiz to win tournament
merchandise
later the crowd was greeted by actress
ahana kumrah who had come to show her
support for Tata wpl 2023.
it's very important to have women in
sports I think for the longest time we
have shied away and I don't think this
can be honked only by men I think we
have to equally share the stage and let
the women take center stage now so I
think if wpl plays their cards right and
I I think if they encourage more and
more women I think a lot of parents will
feel like this is a safe place for women
to
build careers
the second leg of the trophy Drive of
the Tata Women's Premier League 2023
took place in Bengaluru
which began from kantirva Stadium

IPL has started will always support
every hour will come we'll cure for the
players we'll we'll just give our heart
and soul to the team even though we
don't win we've not won yet so I think
the same thing is carried on to women's
uh team as well as Ellis Perry and
Smithy Mandana remind me of Virat Kohli
and ABD so I've always wanted our RCB
women's team to have a door like that so
hopefully they play like that and get us

feel

in all of these pole bound States but
right now Mission Karnataka tops the
bjp's priority list and it's a battle to
validate the hegemony both in terms of
power and legitimacy and the saffron
party is gearing up to fire on all
cylinders leaving nothing to chance as
it faces a tough contest from the
Congress but before that let's decode
the factors that will impact these
elections while the Outreach to the 11
vocalica population is something that
the BJP has its eyes on the support of
at least two prominent lingard much
fears uh is already behind the BJP the
prime minister's back-to-back nine
visits in the last four months are
something that the BJP is banking on on
the other hand in fighting and desertion
over ticket distribution is a point of
concern even though the BJP may try to
downplay it two prominent lingayat
leaders Jagdish shettar and lakshman
savadi have been given tickets from the
congress party this time around and and
the BJP will have to watch for what it
can
really protect its own top from the
punch mostly lingayak leaders want a
bigger slice of the Kota pie plus 40
percent corruption taint which will be
challenges that the BJP will have to pay
but why the bgp thinks it has an edge
well the BJP is banking on its social
engineering which it has been working on
where it has hiked the reservation to 56
after scrapping the four percent Muslim
quota not only that over 30 candidates
from OBC and scst communities have been
given tickets 16 from the St Community
apart from this sources are also telling
us now that the BJP is planning a huge
campaign blitzkrieg 10 to 15 Mega
rallies of the Prime Minister including
road shows will take place and Union
home minister Amit Shah will just camp
in Karnataka for two weeks starting 21st
of April and will campaign the length
and breadth of the state and he's known
for
micromanaging every election from the
district to the Block Level to even the
Panna pramuks and a mega show of
strength by all BJP big guns who have
been fielded in the star campaigners
list so the BJP is reading its battle
plan and this has obviously triggered a
war of words between all the contestants
in the Karnataka elections listening

anti-hindu slurs references made to

anti-hindus laws and here are the
examples references to idol worship
this is uh and allow me to just read
this verbatim you don't know about your
own religion you have so many gods your
religion is Idle worship
even though they were corrected to say
deity worship and they continue to
insist that it's the same when teachers
say these things they undermine the
students and make a mockery of this this
is an example negative references to
polytheism negative references to
religious practices another example in

breaking news uh coming in this is uh
from national capital and we are getting
to know that multiple bats pads and
other stuff have been stolen from Delhi
capital's luggage after they landed from
Bangalore at the Delhi airport the
incident came to light a day later uh as
uh the bags from the cargo comes a day
after so say almost all the players have
lost bats and pads uh with Yazoo also
losing at least five bags the DC team is
deliberately currently how to go about
this issue and take help from the police
if needed Karishma my colleague on the
phone line with us Karishma bring us up
to speed with this latest breaking news
coming in
idea well it's absolutely you know this
is something that is very very shocking
and has happened for the first time in
the history of IPL and we are being told
that almost every player has lost that
syntax from uh you know their Kickbacks
now what happens is when the team must
have been traveling back from Bangalore
to Delhi the kid back some a day later
from the cargo area what we're being
told is uh that it's during that time
that the you know stuff from the
Kickbacks were stolen I can give you an
example your stole a very young player
of the Delhi capitals team five bats
have been stolen from him there are
other players as well who've lost out on
uh bats and pads and other material the
Delhi capitals is still to come out with
an official statement on this but what
we are being told from our sources is
that this is something that has happened
for the first time in IPL history uh
they are likely to file a police
complaint and the BCCI ASU is also
willing to help them if Delhi capitals
goes ahead and approaches them
right
is the team planning to approach the
police as well any details coming in on
that front because earlier of course we
had some info information coming in that
the DC team was deliberately on how to
go about this issue
well yes like I said the Delhi capitals
at the moment is keeping mom about this
issue there has been no official
statement from them but what we learned
from our sources is that they will have
to take help from others to actually
locate us where this incident has
happened because like I said the cargo
comes a day later and you know the
players are not there to look at their
uh uh what is their
reach the hotel rooms to the players and
they open their kit bags when they
realized that more than half of the
stuff from them is missing so they will
have to take the help of a Delhi police
to sort of understand who were involved
where exactly did this happen did this
happen at the cargo terminal or you know
who were in person they will have to
take the help of a Delhi police and I
also spoke uh to you know people within
the BCCI they said that one the
operations is the complete management of
the franchisees there's very little uh
that the basis or the IPL uh Council can
do in this but like I said they've
offered help if they do go and approach
the basic ACU to look into this that
also will be offered to the tele
capitals team but only and only they are
going to be responsible as to how they
deal with this entire matter
right and as far as you know the stolen
items can you give us a little more
details on the same multiple bats pads
and other stuff reportedly stolen uh
from the Delhi capitals luggage from
what exactly has been stored on anything
uh which you're picking up from your
sources far as DC is concerned
that from almost every kid has been
stolen one player has lost five bags of
very young players are losing size bats
you know these youngsters have emotional
connects to their back to dress or stuff
that is there in their kit that's
because it travels with them around the
world so it is a very very a shocking
incident that a stateful place during
the travel of a Delhi Capital scene they
were coming back from Bangalore after
playing the match against them and when
the combo came in half of the stuff was
missing and like I said there is
confirmation of about bats and pads
missing what the other stuff is we will
have to wait if the Delhi Capital uh
comes out with an official statement or
not but this is like I said a very very
unfortunate and a very shocking incident
to have happened in the national capital
the top players of the country their
stuff has been stolen from their kids
back when they were coming to the hotel
uh to the player so that they could
start their practice for the next match
remember the only place foreign
Authority the Delhi Airport Authority
rather or the airlines any other
information as to how something is
bizarre as this could have happened as
you yourself said it's quite shocking
and almost unprecedented that you have
stuff stolen uh stuff like bats and pads
belonging to top cricketers of our
country stolen uh while they landed at
the Delhi Airport
well it's absolutely it is very very
shocking and like I said the Jerry
capital is expected to take the help of
the policy it's not that charity on the
timeline of when this exactly happened
yes it happened a day later when the
Delhi team landed from thank the Lord
now whether it happened at the terminal
or when the stops leaving the airport to
the hotel Delhi we will talk for Clarity
on this from other Delhi Capital C which
is going to be impossible for the Delhi
capitals to solve without the help of
police or the concerned uh authorities
at the Delhi airport because Delhi
airport will also provide CCTV footage
of the set of unless to whether it
happened there or not so all of this
must be you know being decided by the
Delhi capitals management at the moment
as to how exactly to deal with this
because you know bad pads other stuff
also cost a lot of money apart
all of us know that all these players
have some sort of superstition
all of that keeping in mind it also cost
a lot of money to have these things to
have these uh Kickbacks so all of this
is going to be kept in mind when the
Delhi capitals deal with this entire
issue of what has happened at the Delhi
airport and how this could be stolen
from the feedback of the Delhi Capital
split right Karishma so what next
anything you're picking up from your
sources I mean uh far as a police
intervention is concerned that something
which is still under consideration uh
but is the team or the management of the
team is in touch or with the Delhi
Airport Authority or the airlines are
they still trying to look for the Lost
of um what really is the next plan of
action
well absolutely they are going to be
looking for the Lost stuff like I said
they are going to be seeking help from
the Delhi police as well to trace as to
how exactly this could have happened
because like these things
off
okay we've lost that line with Karishma
but Karishma of course was bringing us
all the updates as far as the latest
incident is concerned remember multiple

still said to be focusing on the active
gang members in the business that has
been still run by this gang as this gang
said to have been around 16 companies
that have been registered in their names
crime profile shows that he also entered
the world of crime in 1979 so it's been
over four decades now and it was uh
within if we take a look at uh ever
since that he has been brought from the
sabarmati jail to pragrat for the second
time around in the case of umeshpal
murder case uh he was gunned down by
these killers and within 10 years he
first became the independent MLA from
1979 later and from the area thereafter
there have been several cases when it
comes to murders and extortion and
kidnapping that has been registered
against him even the cases of rape and
sexual violence it was then later in
1984 that I think his rival gang member
as well Chan Baba to create havoc in
other state that time it was progressed
that was earlier known as alabada as
well because priyank the last four
decades and how atiq Ahmed built upon
his Empire this criminal Empire as he
was continued to be endorsed and
supported also and given that political
Patriots that's how the reason that he
became a sansad as well isn't it
uh yes uh I think started as a crime
history in 89 79 and within 10 years he
realized that he himself had to contest
for the election and he won that also
multiple times he kept on winning uh but
the crime graph really shows that just
because his brother Ashraf who's also
dead who was also killed in the in the
shooting which happened at the District
Hospital in prayagraj I started crying
in front of Atik Ahmed that I have lost
my election then he was an independent
candidate then I think promised him this
particular seat will once again be
vacated and open for you so that you can
win this election he eliminated uh the
then MLA pal and then later to that we
saw that Asha wants on that seat so
multiple things were happening but it
was a very uh alarming for us also when
we accessed these documents which was
showing that atiq managed to you know
rescue one of the person who was a
rapist of 25 miners inside a madasa into
their garage and this accused was freed
by Atik and he was you know given an
Escape Route so these kind of thing of
saving a rape is that too of uh miners
who were there inside the madassa uh was
something which was not highlighted in
public that's why uh then then
government did not allow these documents
to come out so that the people could
have actually realized that are they
actually gonna vote for them him uh the
kind of flower that he had was certainly
very important so a person who was
helping the rapist who was an accused in
the case of her children in madata was
being saved by Atik Ahmad was very
shocking but now onwards since I think
he's dead uh the agencies are now
looking at the list of 16 companies
Amita which were owned alishly by this
gang number 227 which is named by uh
atiq Ahmed his family members his wife
was still alive his brother who's dead
and all those uh
returned the politician priyank because
his crime graph something that my
colleague Deepu will actually help us
understand because Deepak even when he
was launched inside the jail he was
still feared
I'd write Amita this is the crime graph
that has been accessed by priyank farage
and if you if I could read out the
contents of this it says
1979 and after that it it lists out atiq
ahmad's family members
who's in jail Ali Ahmad in jail Asad
Ahmed he was encountered and then if I
could read out the operative part goes
on to show how Atik Ahmed wreaked Terror
in the area where he recited 1984
that means in 1984 five years after he
entered the world of crime he eliminated
his rival whose name was Chand Baba and
after that ever since that murder Atik
had wreaked a lot of Terror and in 1992
1993 uh
had planned a lot of murders in 1992 and
1993 and in the year of 2005.
but Ashraf who was accused of gang
raping about three to four juveniles in
a madrasa he was shielded by Atik Ahmed
by using his political Cloud he had
become a samajwadi party leader by then
and he had also become an MLA and using
his political Cloud it goes on to show
how Atik Ahmad got Ashraf out and also
shielded him from major allegations like
gang rape and in the Year 2005
that means in broad daylight Raju pal
was hacked to death in 2005 and he was a
bsp MLA uh bsp candidate and the crime
graph goes out to show that since Raju
pal was his rival political uh candidate
that's why atiq Ahmed eliminated him in
the year 2005. all right Deepak thank

maintenance I don't know exactly the
incident that has happened and what
exactly could have been the major cause
of the aircraft where it suffered a tail
strike
incident being reported on 14th of April
this was a this was an indigo flight
traveling from Mumbai to nagpur and that
is when a trade strike occurred the
flight has been rendered as grounded uh
uh the recovery process basically the
repair work on the concerned flight has
been initiated and the incident has been
thoroughly investigated by uh the Indigo
that is what indigo's statement
basically says what exactly is a taste
like you were also explaining that a
tail strike occurs when the tail or the
empanad of an aircraft hits the ground
or any other a stationary object so this
is a very serious incident basically
when the flight was supposed to land
when the flight was Landing the tail of
the flight of uh hit the ground that's
what we understand but Indigo has also
mentioned in a statement that all the
passengers on board are safe they
basically Allied

damage that has been suffered on that
aircraft this is a tail strike as arunil

there has been another leader who seems
to be jumping ship and deserting as far
as the BJP here in the case is concerned
this is coming across as a setback let
me go across now to Imran now Imran CV
chandrashekar joining the JDS what
exactly is the reason being cited
Member of Parliament had protested
saying that these speakers should be
given to either him or his family member
he had threatened to resign
from BJP and also wanted to result from
minister of parliament he had impact his
supporters
leader from North America wanted it in
order to establish him they have them
have given to yesterday
right but what is also being said that
uh Chandra shekhar had been waiting in
the wings to contest from the
constituency since 2018 but uh it all
happened and it all went in vain
how does it affect the prospects of the
BJP here now because the BJP just came
out with the third list of its
candidates and Mr Chandra shekhar has
been claiming that he was given the
promise to contest the elections so he
would initially contest as an
independent or drawing the JDS but now
he has officially joined the JDS in the
presence of HD kumara Swami
all right so the BJP which is facing a
spree of rebels ahead of the Karnataka
elections and the latest edition in this

a ticket as from the couple assembly

Terror came to be used frequently by a
section of politicians and their Echo
Chambers to suggest that some Hindus
have organized themselves into Terror
groups and pointed towards the malegaon
blast case amongst others however under
legal scrutiny 34 Witnesses in the case
have turned hostile they claim that
their testimonies to the Maharashtra ATS
were cooked up and coached under duress
by the investigating officers of the ATS
later the Nia took over the case and
facts started surfacing today another
witness has been dismissed from the case
since his testimony was to be against a
man who's already been discharged now
remember based on these very testimonies
several people like the much lauded army
man colonel purohit was thrown into jail
others like satvi pragya were eventually
given a clean by the ni in 2016
however the trial still continues today
question questions are now being raised
on who built this fiction to frame them
well after 34 coach testimonies now the
court has outed all of this and it's
important for us to understand what has
really happened in fact let's tell you
how times now today has Unearthed in the
sworn testimonies of these same
Witnesses which really suggests that the
agencies may not have been above board
when these testimonies were collected in
fact here for the first time from the
mouths of the witnesses how words were
allegedly attributed to them even though
they never really spoke to them in fact
some of them were also eyewitnesses in
the case let's get you some of the
testimony now this is very significant
this is witness number 288 statement
this was given on 19th of November last
year what did this witness say well we
have that testimony running there it
says that the laptop shown to me I don't
remember nor identify it goes on to say
that I cannot read write or understand
Marathi I had signed on exhibits on
behalf of my senior he was essentially
asked to sign it by his senior the
witness goes on to say don't recollect
signing of any of these handing over of
the certificate as well now these are
witnesses who have later turned hostile
in the case let's also get you another
such Witnesses statement which was then
taken off this is witness number 108 the
statement was given on 19th of November
what did this witness say that the
police did not inquire with me but
inquired the other so he was not even
questioned by the police as per the
retraction statement that he had given
in court he also said I don't know if
anybody visited purohit or not however
based on testimonies like this remember
colonel purohit was put behind bars this
witness also goes on to say it is not
correct to say that the police have
recorded my statement but despite that
he was presented as a witness remember
he also says that I had not stated the
contents in the portion which have been
marked out he went on to say it is not
correct to say that the statements were
recorded as per my say this is just 2
two of the statements that we are
getting here on times now we are getting
new not one not two but seven different
testimonies which were later retracted
what did the witnesses say when they
retracted that statement that is the
Mega times now exclusive that we are
getting for you this is yet another
witness this is witness number one zero
nine this is the statement that it had
given in court and it says that I
haven't visited the spot and do not have
any more knowledge about all of this in
fact he then goes on to say and we are
going to show you the rest of what he
has said as well he said that I don't
recollect if the police have recorded my
statement so what does this mean this is
a serious lapse in the probe which has
happened if a witness later on says I
don't even recollect giving a statement
to the police he goes on to say purohit
was a good officer was working in a good
manner he went on to say it is not
correct to say that the police are
pressurizing me to depose against
purohit however he does say that purohit
is a good man so there are these
conflicting testimonies which have now
been coming in a lot of these
testimonies now remember have been
retracted by the people who had given to
them so far till date
34 of these Witnesses have now turned
hostile let me go across to our
reporters who are joining us radhika
Rama Swami she is the one who's managed
to access all these testimonies for us
great job radhika because these are
testimonies which were retracted later
on when they face legal scrutiny the
importance of these testimonies radhika
will take our viewers through some more
but the importance of this because based
on these testimonies isn't it right that
several people such as Colonel purohit
even were all locked up for several
years
trial is concerned this was seen several
twists and turns over the last many
years we are talking about 15 years of
twists and turns be it eight years
investigating the case and then ni
taking over the case beat ATS chart
sheet which was completely in
contradiction to the NIH Chachi which is
file later mcoca being dropped by ni and
later of course and I are giving clean
 to several of the accused and so on
of course all the accused are out on
bail many accused were discharged as
well currently of course seven accused
out on bail but the fact remains that
this was seen seven uh you know twists
and turns and there has been a
consistent delay now coming to the you
know Witnesses statement themselves uh
so far more than 300 Witnesses have been
examined off with
when we talk about these 34 Witnesses
most of them as you already mentioned
most of them are connected to the main
accused which is Colonel purohit as well
as sadhi pragya and most of these
accused have in fact even contradictory
statements uh before the court while
they were deposing before the court they
said that you know as they already
pointed out many of them saying that
their statements were taken under duress
they were pressurized by the ATS uh the
last the latest a person who turned
hostile just last week saying that he
was also an army person he said that he
had to give statements at gunpoint so
atheists case completely weekend which
is one of the reasons why of course case
was handed over to Nia but at this point
many of these Witnesses turning hostile
and 34 Witnesses turning hostile is not
a small number and not just that of
these 300 Witnesses many have been
dropped by the prosecution as well today
a witness was dropped simply because he
was called in however he was irrelevant
because he was connected to a discharge
accused that is something that over the
years as well the question is why are
these weaknesses irrelevant Witnesses
being called because this is there is
clearly a delayed tactic also that we
are seeing uh something that had been
spoken by the accused time and again
many many petitions filed before the
higher courts uh so you expedite the
trial as well but that has not happened
uh over the last several years we'll
have to wait and see there are at least
about half a dozen more witnesses who
are to be examined in fact about 10 to
15 more of which many are going to be
dropped certainly and several may be
turning hostile as well well that's very
important because remember this is a
case which dates back to 2008 first it
was being investigated by the ATS then
it went across to the ni now this truth
which is coming to light is many many
decades later it is something which
makes one wonder what was the reason for
so many false Witnesses coached
witnesses as they are calling it a
course test is to be added to the see
those questions being raised let me go
across to pranesh pranesh why don't you
get us two more such testimonies that
radhika has managed to access for us
that's right let's uh put this in
perspective for our viewers and what
better than the witness testimony is
because these are people
who alleged that they were tortured by
the investigating officers during the
course of the probe forced assaulted to
say things that they know they had no
idea about let's come to witness of
witness testimony number 146 here it is
let's in fact begin with 149.
he says I can't say if Colonel purohit
is present in court or not
then he said it is not true that purohit
Saturn is vehicle and went away this is
the testimony this is the Highlight then
he went on to say it is not true that I
read out my statement and it is correct
as per my say so if he was not reading
out a statement who was and why was he
then forced to sign he's right I had not
stated so to the police so obviously
telling the court that they were under
duress to say something that was
prepared by the police and that's very
disturbing because then we have to
understand if the agencies itself are
not above board then what was this
larger
frame up as the BJP is calling it in
fact let me go across to a panelist
charu pragya is joining us spokesperson
of the BJP Subhash Shahs is joining us
and Advocates an Islamic scholar is also
here on our show I'm going to come to
you first for many many years it is over
a decade now that the term Hindu Terror
has been used but one after the other
the kind of cases which were associated
with this term which was coined by a
certain ecosystem have been falling flat
have been fizzling out hasn't it
we need to remember that any kind of an
ecosystem which is spreading a fake
narrative is going to come crashed in
down sooner or later in this particular
case I think we must remember that for
all the U.N cry that the opposition and
the left cabal continues to make the
court has acquitted uh
the court has taken a stand and we need
to respect that today as of today every
there was a lot of pressure for the
police also to act in a certain way
during that investigation that has
stopped now I'm so glad that it has
let me also remind our viewers about
2007 samjhota blast the accused of Simon
and then others they were acquitted in
2019 Mecca Masjid and others acquitted
in 2018. then you had the ajmer Sharif
and six others acquitted in 2017
malegaon and five others were given a
clean by the nif the trial still
continues but they were given a clean
shot by the amni in 2016. so I'll ask
you a simple question was there a hit
job on Hindu Pride
is saying that at that time the police
was course into the investigating
agencies were under the pressure of at
that time the government was why should
I believe that at this particular moment
the investigative agencies are not under
pressure from the BJP government why
shall I believe that the Witnesses are
not getting intimidated you know the
government changed what I want quick
sweep is the Justice being done to the
uh to the victims of the blast if they
have not done if the honorable uh our uh
was not involved if progressing thakur
was not involved
since he is a lawyer that in the absence
of the Witness Protection Law in India
why should we believe that britishes are
not being intimidated today because
the other side is now opposing that
after a regime change essentially after
year sarkar came all the witnesses one
after the other are turning hostile
well they would like to believe so but
uh you know meghna I want to remind you
of some investigation that your own
channel had done a few years ago there
was a case in Delhi where it was being
said that there's been vandalism in
churches Hindu groups have done it so on
and so forth later on it was found out
that it was basically a ploy to make
sure that Hindus has seen in a bad light
in the country there are so many
instances found like that that data will
investigated it turned out that this
entire ecosystem which has been
hell-bent on uh showing the the peace
loving very very tolerant Hindus in a
very different life it's been exposed
and it's been exposed many times I think
this is one more such thing okay is that
anybody who's practicing this religion
is the nation loving there is no way
that they will be involved in anything
which is going to go against what
solicit in detail and also let's remind
our viewers that when it comes
specifically to Colonel purohit he was
called a good officer he got one of the
highest ratings from the Army itself
right before his name suddenly came up
as an anti-national someone who was
carrying out acts of Terror allegedly
against Russian but subhasha there is a
very important Point has raised because
it's been about 15 to 16 years now the
trial has been going on it has gone from
one investigating agency to the other
from the ATS to now the Nia does that
take a toll when it comes to the quality
of witnesses testimonies over the years
many of them 34 in this case have turned
hostile
see look at the time span
the time span plays a very important
role the incident is of 2008 and the
Witnesses are required to Repose after
14 years and 15 years we may not have
the the the memory Fades away and that
is what the Supreme Court has also taken
cognizance off Note off
that you must try the accused as
expeditiously as possible now in 2017
decision
uh the support in the matter of Hussein
versus Union of India has laid down the
outer limit of two years if if the
session's trial cases are to be tried
the trials are required to be concluded
within two years but then that is not
feasible nothing happens even after
Hussain and so many host of other
decisions look at what happened in the
matter of nazeb K nazeb recently the
Supreme Court directed release of the
accused because of long incarceration
although he was languishing in jail for
a very very heinous offense let me tell
you as a lawyer I feel that in my
country the criminal justice system or
the trial delivery system that we have
the trial system that we have is
absolutely obsolete it is outdated it is
it is Antiquated and something which is
drastically needs to be done now look at
look at what happened in the in this
case an officer of the rank of Colonel
in Army who was was responsible for
Gathering sensitive information against
terrorist outfits now look here he
himself had to remain in jail for such a
long period of time and what is going to
be the demoralizing effect and impact on
the on the army or our defense Personnel
if this is the manner in which why see
problem is that why those Witnesses
should be disbelief or why if at all
those police Personnel who have recorded
the statements and the court possibly
has made some of them responsible he
should notice to them saying that you
come and tell us as to why so many
witnesses have turned hostile so whether
though either those Witnesses were not
of that quality which were required to
to be to be to have been examined or
those Witnesses have been really tutored
who give statements now unless and until
we enact our law right and make our
investigators responsible their yes it's
a time to fix accountability but also
those who may have caused as per the
witnesses to give false testimony and
indict people who may have been innocent

center former Congress Chief Sonia
Gandhi has alleged that there is
enforced silence on the actions of the
sarkar in a editorial she has in fact
written in the Hindu Sonia Gandhi writes
and I quote her here she said enforcing
silence cannot solve India's problems
prime minister silent on legitimate
questions on his government's actions
religious festivals have become
occasions to intimidate and Bully others
intimidation and discrimination over
food religion cause gender and language
prime minister ignores she says the
rising tide of hatred and violence egged
on by the BJP and RSS nathas prime
minister she says has not once called
for peace or Harmony acted to reign in
offenders let alone bring them to
justice well those are the words of
Sonia Gandhi in fact after Sonia
Gandhi's op-ed slamming prime minister
you have bjb leaders even the law
Minister tearing in to her mocking
Congress for lecturing on democracy and
illusionary statements of highest
probity
Sonia Gandhi
foreign
foreign
slamming the Prime Minister and saying
there is a conspiracy of Silence when
you question the actions of the
government now you have law Minister
Kiran re JuJu he's teared into Sonia
Gandhi's Congress for lecturing the BJP
on Democracy in fact he says it is
illusory statement of the highest
improvity let me go across to Mohit but
we've seen this back and forth what are
words between the congress party
specifically the Gandhi Rahul and now
even Sonia Gandhi regarding democracy
and the death of it as many have alleged
well in fact uh you see uh we have this
open written by Sonia gandhin which she
has talked about various issues she has
also talked about the misuse of the
agencies when he says that 95 of the
political cases were filed against
opposition parties she also goes on to
say that the institutions are under
attack the girl as she also goes on to
attack the government over the
disruptions in the Parliament and also
goes on to say that the opposition it
stopped opposition is not being allowed
to raise issues of grave concern and she
also goes on to say the PM Modi
government expanding unprecedented
measures of expanding speeches and
preventing discussion and disqualifying
Congress MP at the speed of the light so
this is perhaps the first time that
Sonia Gandhi had come out in the open
and spoken about uh the Rahul Gandhi's
disqualification she has also attacked
prime minister Narendra modishe also
goes on to uh gets into the debate
between the Judiciary versus while she
says that Union Minister has called some
retired judges anti-national and warning
that they will be paying a price and she
goes on to say that this language is
deliberately chosen to intimidate server
solving judges and to that we have a
response coming in from Union Minister
kirinda where she has planned uh
basically the statement that has come in
from Sonia Gandhi in this particular
open and also he goes on to say that
Sonia Gandhi is lecturing about
democracy congress party talking about
independence of Judiciary is an
illusionary statement of highest in
property so we see that how uh Kiran did
you the union law minister right Sonia
Gandhi on this particular issue and we
see a strong attack very strong attack
coming in from Sonia Gandhi we all know
for a fact that she doesn't come out
much in the media given her ill health
but in this particular OPEC she has
attacked prime minister she has also
stated that the government is not having
opposition to raise their voices in the
Parliament and she also goes on to say
uh she also goes on to speak about the
disqualification of Rahul Gandhi's mpb
right as an MP because he's rape voice
against the government
well of course very interesting first it
was Mamta Banerjee and now it is Sonia
Gandhi both of them essentially saying
the same thing which is that there is an
entire Rising tide of hatred and
violence which is being spurred on by
the BJP and the IRS is something which
hasn't gone down too well with the
saffron party well after Sonia Gandhi's
op-ed understandably Congress and other
opposition parties are in full agreement
with her saying that there is yes indeed
and in four silence when it comes to
questioning the actions of the center
listen
yeah Sonia Gandhi is very right and our
government whether it is central
government or other governments of
bharti janta party they are always
silent and every time it happens and
every political leader in a position
they blame RSS and BJP in spite of that
nothing happens RSS BJP
and their leadership they are totally
silent soniyaji has very rightly pointed
out this problem
meanwhile let's tell you what exactly it
is that Sonia Gandhi had said which has
led to this massive war of words between
the Congress and the BJP well Sonia
Gandhi has said and I'm going to quote
her enforcing silence cannot solve
India's problem and the prime minister
is silent on the legitimate questions on
his government's action religious

good evening ladies and gentlemen ahead
of the 2024 high voltage election the
opposition might just be facing con
within and not from the BJP at all the
reason I say this is because often
referred to as the chanakya of the
opposition ranks
has taken the wind out of the sails of
Mr Rahul Gandhi and the opposition sales
the back to back Friendly Fires from Mr
sharat pawar have left the opposition
stunned
and have raised serious questions on the
durability and efficacy of a Unity if
they have to manage to achieve it Mr
Rahul Gandhi who has spearheaded the
attack on the central government with
modani Jai was counted by NCP boss when
he said in an interview with a leading
channel that the Hindenburg report
seemed to be a targeted attack on
industrialist Gotham adani he also went
on to say that a JPC would not solve any
issues of resolving this controversy
because the JPC would have more members
of the BJP itself and that the Supreme
Court coming which was looking into the
matter was probably enough
that was Point number one of Mr Rahul
Gandhi's attack
going on to the second big pillar of
Rahul Gandhi's attack when he alleged
that rupees 20 000 crores suddenly
arrived in Gotham adani shell companies
hinting at fpo that was called off Mr
Rahul Gandhi has been asking what is the
source of this money
today the adani group has issued a
rebuttal to the financial times and
taken on Rahul Gandhi's charge head on
and given a detail of how this money
came in and was reinvested by the
promoter entities to support the growth
of new business while asserting that the
transactions were completely legal and
above board the group has also slammed
the opposition for indulging in politics
in this entire issue
even alleged that the adani group was
linked to Chinese firms that was his
attack number three but what really came
out was the fact that it wasn't Chinese
at all it was actually a Taiwanese
National who had
something to do with the company
so three attacks of Rahul Gandhi from
Hindenburg
two the Chinese company all blunted not
just that the issue of savarkar vaishad
pavar not only punctured Rahul Gandhi's
attack but also dented the ahmadni
parties campaigned to Brand Prime
Minister Modi as somebody who's not well
educated in a tourist message he said
that somebody's degree cannot be a
political issue putting team kejriwal
also on the back foot even former
Congress loyalists someone who's worked
in the Congress and worked with the
Gandhi family for 50 long years
today hit back and revealed that Rahul
Gandhi's secret meat abroad with several
industrialists clearly who belong to the
undesirable elements list
it is shame
is saying I have never any association
or with any businessman whereas their
entire family held all along the
association with businessmen including
him
I still want because I have a great
respect
I have a great
respect for the family
I don't want to speak anything otherwise
I can give 10 example where where he
would he would go and meet even outside
the country to meet even
people who are undesirable businessmen
it is turned for the BJP Now to turn
around and demand that Rahul Gandhi
comes clean listen in to former Minister
Ravi Shankar Prasad
foreign
and that ladies and gentlemen brings me
to the legitimate question on the
NewsHour tonight
Corner opposition Unity facade busted
completely that's the question and the
debate coming up on the other side
you're watching the NewsHour at night
debate number one on times now super
Prime Time
[Music]
and joining me on the debate tonight Dr
sudhanshu Trivedi Member of Parliament
and National spokesperson of the BJP Dr
Anand ranganathan author and scientist
Dr Sanjay jha suspended leader of the
congress party also an author joining us
in just a bit Mr brij Mohan srivastav
National spokesperson of the NCP Karthik
Reddy spokesperson of the BRS joining us
live from Hyderabad and Mr Kishore
tiwari spokesperson of the
udhav camp of the shiv Sena and it is to
Dr Anand ranganathan that my first
question goes Anand ranganathan the
three main tenets of Mr Rahul Gandhi's
attack on the congress party were really
about number one the Hindenburg report
on which Mr sharath pavar has made his
stand known it was a targeted attack on
the adanis by this short seller company
uh the second tenet of his attack was
the 20 000 crores of which a statement
has been issued by the adani group in
response to the financial times and
number three he also raised the question
of the links because Modi is linked to
adani and adani is linked to China so
Modi is linked to China theorem that he
had put forward uh that also busted
because it's not China at all it's
Taiwan so where are we as far as Rahul
Gandhi's adani attack on the prime
minister's concern
good evening to my fellow panelists
there are three issues here number one
the way it is going the way people are
leaving the Congress
I think the day is not far when the only
entity left with Rahul Gandhi or beside
or adjacent to Al Gandhi would be is pet
pity
congressman
is
opening this Pandora's Box the latest
one being Mr Azad I mean these are
really scandalous allegations that have
to be answered not by the male Au pairs
as I call them of Rahul Gandhi and there
are a couple of them but by Rahul Gandhi
himself what is this businessman in the
business deal that Mr Azad is talking of
that Rahul Gandhi indulged in when he
went abroad this is a serious matter
remember it's been more than a decade
and we still do not know the details of
the mou that Rahul Gandhi signed or the
Congress signed with the Chinese
Communist Party those details are not
there in public so you know let us be
very honest here there are two issues
now remaining the third the third one
I've already talked of which is that
slowly the the so-called or the
opposition is disintegrating
and as for the Congress it has to wake
up to reality in avika the opposition to
the bjb vermouth would be actually led
by credible Congress let's be very
honest about it well they also lost
their the problem is they also lost
their National tag today uh the
trinomial Congress and the NCP are no
longer National it's me party which is a
national opposition party
yes but the thing is you know Congress
doesn't want to wake up rational or
Regional doesn't matter as long as you
actually sequester enough MP or you know
enough Lok Sabha seats so the problem
with Congress is if I can use a metaphor
it is like that car that met with a
crash in 2014 the chassis was crumpled
the seats got torn off the roof was
crushed the engine got blown off the
tires burst but miraculously one tire
got detached and rolled off away from
the crash site rolled off and bounced
and jounced along the road that is what
the Congress is alone whether beaten
wheel that is still rolling along it is
miles away from the crash site but
expects the destroyed car to somehow
magically assemble itself to its
pristine glory and come hurtling down
and meet with a lone meal well that's
not going to happen what can happen is
that an Innova driven by Didi will come
along and the best the wheel
can do is to become innova's technique
is Congress prepared for that is Raul
Gandhi prepared to be a Stephanie well
Dr Sanjay jha Dr Sanjay jha the question
uh is straightforward to you three
tenets of Rahul Gandhi's attack all
punctured up not by anybody else but the
Maha vikasa the mentor and Senior
politician Mr sharat pawar and now you
have a question that's uh staring you in
the eye who are these undesirable
businessmen who Rahul Gandhi used to
meet when he used to travel abroad why
did he always want to duck his SPG
because he was meeting these people
these are questions that people today
are asking and not just that as a party
that brought the right to Information
Act don't you think you should make the
mou with China absolutely public
what is there in that mou
uh problems uh are his own and I don't
think the congress party is at all
obliged to kind of adhere to whatever he
said and to be honest with you I
astonished and I need to say this very
publicly that I think Mr pavar is
clearly not fathom the enormity of the
shenanigans that have been committed let
us wait for the Supreme Court committee
let us hopefully wait for the JPC to
pass a verdict on it but I think it was
rather presumptuous on his part to
believe that just because he gave an
interview to a TV channel which is owned
by Gotham adani that becomes a Holy
Grail Point number two as far as Mr
gulab Nabi azad's comment on Rahul
Gandhi's meeting or proximity with
businessmen during his travel abroad is
concerned I'll again be very upfront
with you gulab WG has been very good to
me and I have enormous respect for him
but I disagree with this whole approach
of even veteran Congress people like him
and I repeated once again I probably
even talk to him after this program is
over but I do not appreciate you know
rubbishing people in a manner which
almost amounts to slander I would say
if there is any insinuation being made
that Rahul Gandhi's you know
relationship with these people abroad uh
tantamounts to some kind of a supportive
Financial embezzlement or a threat to
National Security name them but you know
these kind of very uh cryptic at the
same time very definitely language I
don't think it it does Mr gulam Navi
azad's stature any justice and I repeat
once again I'm enormously fond of the
man I'm also distressed that the
situation has become so irreconcilable
your third point I think that you asked
me about was the Congress people leaving
the congress party and where does it
leave the future of the grand old party
I
foreign problem is is formidable but the
Congress seems to be at this point
despite all these recent I would say
headwinds on a on a slow path to
recovery the bharaja has been exactly
like really uh
playing out in the open siddharamaya
versus DK shiv Kumar playing out in the
open and and uh Mr bhupesh bhagal and
tia Singh is part of folklore and you're
saying it's making a recovery I must say
that you're a very very very optimistic
congressman and you know after your
Revelations on your friendship with
gulam Nabi Azad I think you're going to
remain suspended for a while but Anand
ranganathan is showing something I'm
going to Dr Sudan Shu Trivedi but what
is it that you are playing Anand no
navika just because my good friend
Sanjay said that I I really have deep
respect for Mr Ghulam nabial but I don't
appreciate this chief political points
and you know these Shenanigans and
slander well will Mr Sanjay jha
criticize Mr Rahul Gandhi for tweeting
this
what is this if not Slender these are
all five congressmen and look one of the
letters of each of their names is
spelling adani so Sanjay you need to
counsel Rahul Gandhi first in not
talking about well said slander uh
obviously Dr Sudan Shu Trivedi seems to
be reserved as a right for Mr Rahul
Gandhi and the congress party and not
for others uh after what Dr Sanjaya said
how do you how do you respond
to this whole crashing down of the ship
ship that was being made by the
opposition with all these issues adani
evm degree uh Pegasus edcbi it is
actually I will give the response now
because you on two aspect one is a
purely technical another is a political
or the technical aspect I would like to
ask that if Hindenburg which is facing
charges in its own country for
manipulating the shots so one person
facing allegation in the U.S court now
getting support for the one person who
is facing allegation of corruption in
National Herald case in the Indian
course so birds of same feather flock
together and now they have becoming the
champions of probity Chastity and
disrespecting discarding all the
agencies Regulators institutions and on
and on but they are saying that the one
company which is being strictly
prohibited by the U.S court not to
publish any report regarding any company
because it is being found that they were
consistently getting profit by Short
Selling and Mr Sanjay jha is it not fact
that the Hindenburg has bought the
shares of adani
is this the work of a media house
is this the Chastity it is the true
journalism and you are trying to buy the
shares and get and and buy just one
story they couldn't have managed to
bring down the share market but with the
true Association of the uh opposition
parties here then they created a
situation by virtue of which Hindenburg
has gone crores of rupees by doing the
short selling now I am coming to other
aspect why it happens that always a
company from outside gets so much of
support and affection from congress
party since last 40 years I would like
to remind Mr Anderson of Union Carbide
the Bhopal gas strategy frame from 1984
then another foreign company beauforts
that supported by Congress hobitzer
supported by Congress Augusta Westland
supported by Congress now BBC or
Hindenburg and whenever a tainted person
emerges from outside is having linked to
the first family of the Congress even
during their regime the Volker report
Mr Volker had put a report in 2006 that
that Saddam Hussein given the oil
coupons and direct money to the congress
party based on it Mr Network saying that
then foreign minister has to resign and
he has written most of the thing in this
book the name of the book is one life is
not enough and if Congress is having
audacity they can challenge him and then
whether it is gaido HK connected to the
first family Christian Michelle
connected to the first family
connected to the first family Andre
Anderson so I want a clear technical
answer can you name a single instance
into the congress party has taken a
stand against a foreign company
it's always taking the side of the
foreign firms and foreign institutions
and attacking the Indian institutions
and on the political side
foreign
foreign
why don't you come out clean about that
at least at that time a party was in
power why don't you want to come clean
on that is all transparency only
required of the Modi sarkar and none
from the Gandhi parivar well in Africa
once again a short answer but before I
answer that I need to need to correct a
a very blatant lie being spread by Sudan
shuji today and he's a friend but I need
to call him out the Hindenburg report
Sudan shuji it's a short seller company
it owns bonds and stocks and sells them
that is the way Financial transactions
are done all over the world and by the
way
150 billion US dollar car market
capitalization Wipeout cannot be done by
Rahul Gandhi in consultation or in
conspiracy with Hindenburg Resorts
the fact that you uh decided to ignore
my question on the Chinese mou but Dr
sudhanshu Trivedi ball in your
has honestly accepted that Hindenburg is
a short selling company it's a neither
media house nor an investigating company
so I am exhausted by the logic that a
short selling company which is Under
Suspicion for doing doing unethical
business practices are considered to be
the symbol of ethics
and morality here in India
and on the issue of other on the issue
of adani I would like to say Sir let me
complete the sentence then you can
respond on the issue of adani if there
are so much convinced that the adani has
done fraud adani has done uh taken a
money from illegal sources so why your
chief minister is not acting on that the
biggest power project with adani has got
in the last six months is 60
000 Core Power project can run and in
Institute of withdrawing or putting an
inquiry Rajasthani government has given
hundreds of acres of land
keeps raising again the issue of JPC
Mr sharat pawar and his experience is
unparalleled his experience in
Parliament and parliamentary procedures
I mean the man knows it the man knows it
all and he said in his interview he said
very clearly that making a JPC is not
going to answer too many questions
simply because just because of the logic
that the JPC will have a greater number
of BJP members of parliament and a
lesser number of the opposition so
basically saying that whatever the
ruling government ruling party wants
will be passed in the JPC now given that
fact do you think
the entire tirade of Mr Rahul Gandhi and
the congress party was unfounded and
ill-founded on on bad premises as far as
this issue is concerned
no I think it is not like that Madam
has expressed his personal views
on the channel
but he has not imposed his opinion or
his wish on the Congress he
it was his views and
and when
when he is saying this thing he was
telling the facts that because he was a
chairman of a JPC at the Coca-Cola issue
so he was having that experience
regarding that JPC community so he was
telling those things it is up to the
Congress and the other our colleagues
whether they are they are angry or they
are not angry if those peoples are not
angry sure power chairs is spoken in his
nashik press conference very straight
way that if our our colleagues are not
agree with My Views no doubt we will
withdraw that thing so overall the unity
of the unity of the opposition is not
affected by his uh statement or his
interview it's very clear second thing
is this that Dr Trivedi was asking
regarding this relation of the congress
with the Union Carbide one question I
also want to raise
then why they have taken this decision
why you your party has not stop him by
not ask him why you are taking the this
Anderson case the Supreme Court
answer the question
is not here to defend himself please
respond I will answer
no no no I think either with mohanji is
unaware of the fact or he is
deliberately trying to deceit the people
never gave any advice to Union Carbide
it for the Dow Chemical Company which
has taken the Union Carbide so he had
just given an opinion that the criminal
proceedings on the chairman of the Union
Carbide doesn't transfers to the Dow
chemicals
[Music]
are different so Anderson
Financial liabilities
foreign foreign
foreign
there are so many issues that the
opposition picked up from adani uh you
know we gave you the three premises to
EVMS to degrees which were questioned by
Mr arvind kejriwal to Pegasus you know
Ed CBI some of these have been responded
to by the courts and some of them that
remained I think Mr sharat pawar has
busted and taken the wind out of the
sales of the evm
you know question of the degree question
I want to now ask you what is what is
really the premise and what is the
common minimum program of the opposition
to unite itself and go Whole Hog against
Modi and Modi sarkar
good evening firstly let me answer your
question
if the opposition ever comes together
and any issues the Prime Minister
himself says
and if the opposition doesn't come
together then the BJP is propaganda
machine kind of throws mud at the
opposition saying see opposition never
come together on any aspect
coming to the matter of CVM now coming
to the matter of Education I think we
can agree on certain facts or certain
matters but when it comes to the matter
of adani I believe it is his own
personal matter or its Party stand that
should not be stuck to all opposition I
was just listening to Sudan shuji and he
is one of the favorite BJP spokesperson
of mine not like all the new people who
are right right now owning a BJP or
national television I've been seeing him
for a long time and one of the few
people I really like to listen to from
the BJP and I like to disagree with him
when he made a point with about
Hindenburg I am no spokesperson of
Hindenburg I have no association I am
not into stocks Hindenburg is a short
seller their business is to own stock
and make sure they file a report on a
company and their company collapses
sudhanshuji they have filed reports on
many companies in the states and outside
the states let me tell you all the
reports that they have filed did come
into fruition and they have reaped many
profits I want to also challenge do you
think the same Hindenburg if they file a
chart if they file a report against TCS
or Wipro do you think the same the
market should react the same way no
another point I do not know what case
right now or what investigation is
running in the America
in the United States against Hindenburg
but you know what is not happening in
America adani not suing Hindenburg
navigate one thing is very crystal clear
whether there is an inquiry around
whether there is a JPC Port whether
there is a proper investigation run
against adani the people of this country
are convinced conveniently completely
convinced that adani is the biggest scam
in this country and it is the prime
minister of India who is clearly
protecting him okay without proving any
point uh people of this country will
believe that Dani is the biggest camp
but will people not then ask the same
question that Mr Ravi Shankar Prasad
asks today the BJP is asking today that
who are these uh so-called characters
from various
undesirable lists who were meeting Rahul
Gandhi won't that question be asked and
won't people believe that
without substantial basis
I mean why should anybody else even
speculate who those people are and I
think that's extremely nasty on his part
to be very honest no no no no no nasty
because we raise the question
what character assassination are you
talking about Mr gulab Nabi Azad is a
well-respected person and Sanjay you
have tremendous respect for him you just
said so can you please answer nothing he
says right please please
yeah you don't agree but that doesn't
that doesn't mean everybody because he
says something I respecting him in
everything else but this issue
I'll ask a very simple yes and no
question to
a friend of Rajiv Gandhi yes or no
simple answer the case has been closed
by both the Delhi
that's not the answer that's not the
answer
yes has been closed so what cases there
is
been closed because no no why has the
case been closed is it a clean Dr
sudhanshu Trivedi on the buffers issue
and and that the you know now you cannot
raise the question
ever again because the case is closed
says Dr Sanjaya
that was the evidence they tried very
hard with letters again I would like to
remind to the listeners
let me complete the sentences I would
like to remind the listeners your
viewers millions of viewers who are
watching this that the otoviochi was
having a red car notice in the
concluding days of UPA one government he
entered into Argentina from where we
were having not a repatriation
and instead of issuing against
account and by that time our government
again so what happened then again it was
your government
you have not done anything it's like
another example
foreign
you'll be over here stands for the
entire money back to
contemplated
the report
no no but then but then his question to
you is about
his question to you is about me
foreign
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign foreign
foreign
can you quote a single clause and power
of the Indian constitution by which a
JPC of Indian Parliament can call any
foreign company
to appear before it as a witness when
the company is not working in India if a
company is working on Indian soil then
definitely parliamentary committee can
come up if the company is not working on
Indian soil to just tell me by which
clause a company can call a company like
Hindenburg can be called by JPC to put a
witness because this is the only source
which you people are quoting because you
are denying the LIC you are denying the
SBI you are denying the Savior and you
are saying all else I am not having
faith I am faith in the report so just
tell me the cloth then I will try to
convert to our superiors kindly tell me
which rule which clause can authorize
and compile the foreign company to
appear before the Indian Parliament
response
Unity of opposition
but that is what we'll have to wait and
watch it seems like there is of course
the beginning of some amount of disarray
till the opposition finds another issue
that can bring all the parties together
this issue clearly facing rough weather
for the moment
let's leave it at that thank you very
much to my panelists for joining me on

actually sequester enough MP or you know
enough Lok Sabha seats so the problem
with Congress is if I can use a metaphor
it is like that car that met with a
crash in 2014 the chassis was crumpled
the seats got torn off the roof was
crushed the engine got blown off the
tires burst but miraculously one tire
got detached and rolled off away from
the crash site rolled off and bounced
and jounced along the road that is what
the Congress is alone whether we turn
wheel that is still rolling along it is
my miles away from the crash site but
expects the destroyed car to somehow
magically assemble itself to its
pristine glory and come hurtling down
and meet with a lone meal well that's
not going to happen what can happen is
that an Innova driven by Didi will come
along and the best the wheel
can do is to become innova's technique
is Congress prepared for that is Rahul
Gandhi prepared to be a Stephanie well
Dr Sanjay jha Dr Sanjay jha the question
uh is straightforward to you three
tenets of Rahul Gandhi's attack all
punctured up not by anybody else but the
Maha vikas sagari mentor and Senior
politician Mr Sharad pawar and now you
have a question that's staring you in
the eye who are these undesirable
businessmen who Rahul Gandhi used to
meet when he used to travel abroad why
did he always want to duck his SPG
because he was meeting these people
these are questions that people today
are asking and not just that as a party
that brought the right to Information
Act don't you think you should make the
mou with China absolutely public
what is there in that mou
uh navika I'll try and answer you in
brief uh Point number one uh Mr sharat
pawar's comment on the Hindenburg
research or his views on Gautam
buddhani's uh problems uh are his own
and I don't think the congress party is
at all obliged to kind of adhere to
whatever he said and to be honest with
you I was astonished and I need to say
this very publicly that I think Mr pavar
has clearly not fathom the enormity of
the shenanigans that have been committed
let us wait for the Supreme Court
committee let us hopefully wait for the
JPC to pass a verdict on it but I think
it was rather presumptuous on his part
to believe that just because he gave an
interview to a TV channel which is owned
by Gotham adani that becomes a Holy
Grail Point number two as far as Mr
gulab Nabi azad's comment on Rahul
Gandhi's meeting or proximity with
businessmen during his travel abroad is
concerned I'll again be very upfront
with you gulam WG has been very good to
me and I have enormous respect for him
but I disagree with this whole approach
of even veteran Congress people like him
and I repeat it once again I'll probably
even talk to him after this program is
over but I do not appreciate you know
rubbishing people in a manner which
almost amounts to slander I would say
that if there are businessmen who are of
a very interesting
if there is an if there is any
insinuation being made that Rahul
Gandhi's you know relationship with
these people abroad uh tantamounts to
some kind of a support of financial
embezzlement or a threat to National
Security name them but you know these
kind of very uh cryptic at the same time
very definitely language I don't think
it it does Mr gulam Navi azad's statured
any justice and I repeat once again I'm
enormously fond of the man I'm also
distressed that the situation has become
so irreconcilable your third point I
think that you asked me about was the
Congress people leaving the congress
party and where does it leave the future
of the grand old party I
the problem is is
formidable but the Congress seems to be
at this point despite all these recent I
would say headwinds on a on a slow path
to recovery the bhara yatra has been
exactly like really like really uh such
a silent versus
DK shiv Kumar playing out in the open
and and uh Mr bhupesh bhagail and tia
Singh is part of folklore and you're
saying it's making a recovery I must say
that you're a very very very optimistic
congressman and uh you know after your
Revelations on your friendship with
gulam Nabi Azad I think you're going to
remain suspended for a while but Anand
ranganathan is showing something I'm
going to Dr sudhanshu Trivedi but what
is it that you uh are this playing Anand
no navika just because my good friend
Sanjay said that I I really have deep
respect for Mr gulam Nabi Allah but I
don't appreciate this cheap political
points and you know this shenanigans and
slander well will Mr Sanjay jha
criticize Mr Rahul Gandhi for tweeting
this
what is this if not slander these are
all five congressmen and look one of the
letters of each of their names is
spelling adani so Sanjay you need to
counsel Rahul Gandhi first in not
talking about well said slander uh
obviously Dr sudhanshu Trivedi seems to
be reserved as a right for Mr Rahul
Gandhi and the congress party and not
for others after what Dr Sanjaya said

the it Ministry on Thursday notified a
new rule that will give powers to the
Press information Bureau to fact check
any fake or false or misleading
information about this central
government and thereafter ask it to be
taken down by the social media platform
such as Facebook Twitter and Google Now
if these companies refuse to abide by
the order of the pib fact check they
will lose their Safe Harbor immunity
that guarantees them protection against
any illegal or false content posted by
the users on their platforms now the
changes which had raised a lot of
controversy earlier as well when they
were proposed as part of the amendments
to the it rules 2021 would see the
creation of a fact check unit within the
pib that would keep a check on any
misleading or fake information with
relation to the workings of the central
government this new Amendment of the I.T
rules means that the platforms will no
longer enjoy legal Immunity on content
posted by their users so platforms can
now be called as a party in the court
proceedings as well
all right our reactions also coming in
from the congress party after the
decision was taken now the congress
party saying that the history of this
government is Tainted and the congress
party has also reacted to it saying this
is curbing of freedom of speech this is
a way of targeting the opposition
leaders that's the reaction coming in
listening
foreign
leaders from making their points this is
the reaction from the congress party but
the BJP has clarified that this is not
going to curve freedom of speech this is
only uh going to be a fact check
loading the decision of the government
saying this is the uh Crackdown on the
fake news Peddlers listen
foreign
let's go across to my colleague Krishna
joining us on the broadcast this
decision that has been taken by the
government has already sparked a lot of
controversy with the opposition saying
this is curbing of speech but the
government's clarification that has come
in says this is just going to be a check
on fact this is just a fact check that's
going to happen so why is the opposition
rattled
well you know these are two there are
two versions as you rightly put it and
really the subject of the discourse if
we get into it a little deeper in terms
of what each side is saying we have the
government for instance which says that
yes rejoenders have been issued for
instance in the past when wrong stories
have come out but because of the
proliferation of fake news out there in
the public domain particularly with the
Advent of social media it is very
important and imperative to debunk any
false claims of myths that will be
propagated and that is why this kind of
uh you know a fact check is something
that is required and very much the need
of the r to keep up with the
technological changes that are there
which could possibly spread you know
wrong news you know across various media
that is the version of the government
what the opposition is saying if I can
elaborate it a little further is that
their point is that when it comes to you
know any story any journalistic story
for instance the government is uh not a
party that is completely above very
often those stories are about
departments related to the government so
if another wing of the central
government is going to decide what is a
fact and what is not a fact then that
becomes problematic because there could
be people who have an alternate
perspective and that perspective will
then be considered as completely false
therefore they are saying this is a
curbing of freedom of speech and is not
appropriate for the government to be
doing it's a controversy that we've seen
several times in the past in this
particular context so uh with The
Branding of a fact check it makes it
problematic securely the opposition says
because it does not leave scope for any
kind of questioning any kind of
alternative perspective of you and that
certainly is a problem with this kind of
a policies what opposition says how they
will further take up this entire issue
and protest on it remains to be seen",True,en,5530,13,23

well you heard Donald Trump and he is
saying that there is a conspiracy to
stop him from contesting the 2024
elections now for more on this I'm being
joined by my colleague shrinjoy srinjoy
how will this case affect Donald Trump's
2024 election pitch
well first of all we'll have to see
whether he will he can actually contest
this election or not that's the first
thing secondly this is only one case
first you have these tax cases then you
have the hash money that was paid to
Stormy Daniels the porn star but the
most important part is really relating
to his encouragement to his supporters
to enter the U.S Congress and uh cease
and Destroy property and so on now that
is the biggest one if he is inducted on
that one it would be very difficult for
him already as far as contesting
elections is concerned at least even
among Democrats and independents in the
United States he doesn't have much
support it's only his core supporters
among the Republicans not all the
Republicans but his coach supporters
among the Republicans who believe that
he should contest elections now whether
the law allows him to do not we will
have to see because it's his tax cases
it's this Stormy Daniels hashmani case
and also this encouragement to attack
the U.S Congress all of these cases have
lined up uh have lined up and there is a
lot against him now all he is saying is
that he's done whatever he's done for
the good of America and that the Biden
family of Peace but beyond that he has
to defend himself in court and he has to
clear his name now whether his lawyers
will be able to do that or not we will
have to see
thank you shrinjoy for all these inside
details and yes the 2024 elections in
the U.S and in India as well will be an
interesting event to keep an eye on",True,en,667,4,29

denied bail in the case filed by the CBI

this means the sesodia will have to

leaving the Ahmad party high and dry

observed that the payment of advanced
alleged Kickbacks of around

20 to 30 crores out of them were have

permitted to be tweaked and manipulated
by the applicant to protect and preserve
the interests of the South liquor Lobby
and to ensure repayments of alleged
Kickbacks to the said Lobby the court
order also reads that the evidence
collected so far clearly shows that the

Visionary was in contact with the South
Lobby and the formulation of a favorable
policy for them was being insured at
every cost and a cartel was also
permitted to be formed to achieve
Monopoly in the sale of certain liquor
Brands and favored manufacturers it was
also permitted to be done against the
very objectives of the policy the court
also having observed that it is not
inclined to release the applicant on
bail at this stage of Investigation as
his release May adversely affect the
ongoing investigation and will also
seriously hamper the progress thereof it
said the role played by the applicant
cannot be equated with or put at par
with the roles of the other three
accused to have been granted regular
bail by the court earlier the court also
said that there were serious
apprehensions of Destruction or
tampering of evidence or of influencing
the prime goodnesses as well

find anything incriminating against the

well yes the court was of the opinion
that there may be serious apprehensions

therefore it was stated that uh is not
going to be released on bail and
therefore it was denied
it was also stated that his release in
adversity affect the ongoing

stated that Saudia played an
instrumental role and the most important
role in this criminal conspiracy it was
also stated that advanced Kickbacks of
approximately 90 to 100 tours were meant
for Manisha sodia and his colleagues at

get asked is
why should I not get angry
if I'm not angry people will take
advantage of me
calmness is seen as weakness not
strength also anger gives me the push to
take powerful action
do you feel the same way does this
question resonate with you
do you believe in using anger to search
forward in life should you or should you
not
let us go into it today
namaste
travel with me today only if you have
the courage to see the truth
every one of us knows an angry person
and this angry person could be one of
your parents a friend a child a neighbor
or a colleague sometimes this angry
person could be yourself also
and remember
I am not equating anger with the outward
expression of picking fights shouting
violence
breaking things road rage walking out on
people yes these are definitely signs of
anger but there is another kind of anger
also one that simmers inside you like
steam in a pressure cooker
of course all anger bursts out it can't
be contained
and when it bursts out it takes everyone
around you by surprise including
yourself suppressed anger usually takes
three forms one it becomes a chronic
disease over time
anger is destructive energy
that energy will hurt you and other
two it morphs into an addiction
very strange addictions like stealing
anorexia or bulimia or video gaming
substances or quitting
this is because your repressed anger is
so unbearable you want to run run as
fast as possible
that is why you quit people
quit relationships jobs
places
and it is in trying to run
you are escaping into addiction
three
your anger changes shape and becomes
bouts of crying and depression
do you think any of these are
constructive
no not at all it is destructive to you
and others did you know that two hours
after an angry Outburst the chance of
having a heart attack doubles
did you know that there was a three
times higher risk of having a stroke
from a blood clot to the brain or
bleeding within the brain during the two
hours after an angry outburst Harvard
University scientists have found that in
healthy people
simply recalling an angry experience
from that past
a six hour dip in levels of the antibody
immunoglobin a the cell's first line of
defense against infection
do you still think your anger is serving
you
now let us address the frequently asked
questions
why can't I use anger to create change
in society
why can't I use anger to bring change in
my family
why can't I use anger to take solid
action
why can't I use anger to push myself to
progress
agreed
agreed that anger is energy it has a
force to move things you can scare
people with your anger and get things
done
momentary anger or irritation is natural
and it subsides
there were moments when Buddha and SRI
Krishna were angry too
but when you sustain your anger and try
to use it
it will destroy you
it's not merely an emotion it is a
stupid state that alters your brain
chemistry and neurology your brain's
chemistry becomes such that
you can only perceive the object of your
anger as being negative
you simply forget anything good about
the other
perhaps you are able to create some
change some change in the behavior of a
person with your anger
but know that such a change is temporary
and superficial
your anger energy has become part of
theater
please understand
that the means cannot be separated from
the end
that is why Bloody revolutions built on
anger have only resulted in bloody
endings
study history and it will show you proof
changes brought in a system with anger
violence and hate
spreads like an infection throughout the
system
it can't cause well-being you might use
your anger against someone who insulted
you as a fuel to rise out of poverty to
achieve something in life it is possible
but what have you become in the
meanwhile
have you ever brought attention to that
you have become a monster
crude or sophisticated is the only
difference
expressive or suppressive is the only
difference
the Buddha once said using your anger to
hurt someone else
is like holding a burning coal in your
hand
with the intention of throwing it on
others not realizing it is burning your
hand first
you are mistaken if you think you are
using anger
no It is anger that is using you
over the years you have become an
intolerant impatient and fault-finding
human being
you would have lost loved ones or become
distant from them because your anger
would have provoked that anger anger
provokes further anger
don't ever imagine that you will give
into your anger and say what comes to
your head While others have to take it
sitting
it does not work that way
your anger will make the other angry it
does not end in peace or any form of
realization
anger is the wrong fuel
it is like using crude oil to fly a
plane if you want to fly you must use
Aviation gasoline
only when you shift your fuel from anger
to beautiful states of passion clear
thinking Joy love for learning desire to
make a difference only when your fuel
changes can you fly higher in life
otherwise you will have to make
emergency Landings
what I am telling you is the hard truth
reflect on it deeply if you have the
courage reflect on your anger if you
have the passion to change yourself and
live an enlightened life
in the meanwhile I will share an
anecdote with you in rural India there
is a way of catching mischievous monkeys
that come to steal from homes The
Villages deliberately leave some very
aromatic desserts in a tiny hole in a
tree
the monkey gets excited smelling the
desserts and squeezes its hand through
the tiny hole and gets hold of the
delicious dessert
but the whole is too small for it to get
its closed fist out the monkey struggles
to get its hand out of the hole
but will not let go of the desert and so
is stuck and The Villages easily Come
and catch it and give it some nice
thrashings
they keep the monkey tied for a day or
two and leave it in the nearby forests
the terrified monkey does not easily
come back into the village
that's how it is with anger you hold on
to your anger and refuse to let go of it
until you commit enough wrong actions
and utter enough wrong words
that lead you to getting a beating from
life
sadly an angry mind is exactly like this
monkey's mind the more you are thrashed
by life the more tightly you will cling
on to your anger because each time you
receive a blow from life like losing
your respect losing a job losing your
health losing an opportunity or losing a
friendship losing a girlfriend or
boyfriend because of your wrong actions
your anger only grows towards the person
with whom you are originally angry you
go on blaming that person for all of
your problems you refuse to see that it
is you are holding on to anger and your
wrong actions
that is giving you the beating not what
the other did to you years or months ago
remember anyone can hurt you once can
hurt you 10 times over a hundred times
but what hurts you the most is yourself
it is you who hurts yourself every time
you move into Angkor
unless the monkey chooses to let go of
the desert it has no freedom similarly
unless you make the decision to let go
of your anger habit of blaming the other
there is no freedom for you
you are not free to be happy you are not
free to love again our ancients said
that your anger is your greatest enemy
they also said your anger is the most
difficult enemy to defeat
sounds so true isn't it because if you
looked into yourself and asked who is
hurting you the most
in an awareness your fingers would only
point in the direction of someone else
they would never point in the direction
of your own angry might for a few
moments
stop blaming someone else
stop blaming yourself too
calmly reflect on how much you have lost
because of your angry thoughts Angry
Words and angry actions
it does take courage to see yourself
you cannot stand in front of a mirror
and live in denial of what you see
but it is in only seeing your own inner
truth that you can become free I don't
teach anger management I teach the way
to freedom from anger if you're up for
the challenge
start the practice of Syrian mind
meditation
it will surely break the anger circuits
in your brain
the past is always there in your mind
you can never be free of your past
from the day you were born till today
you have all the memories that you
remember they're all from your past
so past is a part of you the good things
of the past the bad things of the past
but for some reason
if you are constantly feeling sorrow or
sadness
then it need not be from the past that's
happening to you from this life
your past is just not from the time you
were born your past moves beyond that
your past is in your mother's womb
your past is your past life
your past is your parents flowing
through you
your grandparents flowing through you
your great grandparents flowing through
your ancestors
so there's a lot of past that is flowing
through you and you are experiencing
your life
today with that fast flowing in you
now is it possible to become free of
that sorrow that is Flowing from the
past we don't know from where it's
exactly flowing but from wherever it is
Flowing is it possible to become free of
it the answer is yes it is possible to
become free of this past today science
proves that
for three generations
destructive emotions can pass on into
your cells that is if you feel fear
today
you can pass it on to your children your
children to their children and their
children to their children that is why
it is so important that each and every
one of you in this room
become enlightened because if you feel
loved and if you feel compassion that is
what you will pass on as genetic
information to your children their
children and their children
just imagine how important it is it is
not how much wealth you are going to
pass on
it is not what power and position you're
going to pass on
it is not how much of beauty or height
you are going to pass on all that is
least important
if you understand how important what is
the information you are going to pass on
to your next generation
many of you have heard the painful Cry
of young women in Afghanistan
saying
by very born women
even animals have freedom to go where
they want to go why can't we walk on the
road freely
why can't we drive freely
why can't we talk with a stranger freely
why can't we get educated
why can't we shine
it is a Calamity to a nation if half its
population is going to be oppressed
how can your children be wise
if their mothers are frustrated
uneducated
and miserable
theories of so many women wetting the
Earth can only mean disaster
to that country
these are karmic laws you can't escape
families
Nations and cultures are proof to this
law
Humanity irrespective of religion or
culture has to wake up has to wake up to
honor and respect women
a woman is a force of nature
she's like the Earth
she Birds she nurtures she inspires
and you cannot Crush her
today let us discuss the power and
potential of
women
us
our mothers our daughters siblings
partners
bosses colleagues and Friends
join me in this exploration
thank you
namaste
who do you think is greater man or a
woman
who do you think is wiser man or a woman
who do you think is designed to be a
leader
woman or a man
this very question of Greater and lesser
inferior and Superior
is an erroneous concept that has gripped
Humanity we can say only over the past
few hundred years
if you looked at three of the most
ancient cultures of the world the
Chinese the Indian and Egyptian
this only spoke of harmonizing
they never spoke of one dominating over
the other the ancient Chinese spoke of
Yin and Yang the ancient Indians spoke
of prakriti and purusha ancient Egyptian
spoke of new and now not
and history is a proof
that so long as Harmony existed Society
was beautiful brains came children were
born healthy the world was more peaceful
the day this balance and Harmony was
lost
today women became suppressed and
Society became male dominated was broke
out between people between nations
diseases rules youth became Wayward they
lost their purpose
that is why ancient Hindu Secret
yes
which means
in whichever family organization
or a relationship
a woman is respected and is happy
there the Divine is pleased
and gives blessings of abundance
so men must respect their daughter
mother wife sister and friends if they
want abundance
and women must learn to truly become
whole and happy
I want every woman to remember this
please do not think that a man can make
you feel whole or a man can make you
feel loud if you continue to remain in
an unhappy consciousness it is only a
woman who feels whole in herself it is
that woman who can give love
it is that woman who can feel loved
I see women as having four major
Dimensions to herself
every woman has a potential to be yogini
or a Mystic
janani or a mother
a dhangini or a partner
I or a leader
let us talk of women as a yogini or a
Mystic how many of you feel you are your
guineas how many of you feel your
Mystics
a Mystic is someone who can access a
reality Beyond logic she can experience
transcendental states she can access
intuition she can connect to her High
herself she can connect to the universal
intelligence
do you know that for most men the neural
connections run from Back to Front in
the same hemisphere of the brain
the left hemisphere standing for logic
and the right hemisphere standing for
intuition but in a woman's brain a large
amount of connections run laterally
between the right and the left
hemispheres that means
the woman has the potential to easily
move from logic to the mystical she can
quickly move from analysis to intuition
for you to awaken to the Mystic
dimension of your Consciousness your
penial gland which is located
right at your eyebrow Center that needs
to be awakened
when your pineal gland is activated or
your third eye is activated you receive
guidance from the universal intelligence
for Century spiritual dimension of women
was suppressed they were told
that to become enlightened they have to
be reborn as a man
but Krishna ji and I are disproving
these assumptions at akam we have
created so many women mistakes who are
impacting the world today
the second attribute of
janani or the mother
Nature has blessed a woman with a
special body chemistry a woman naturally
secretes huge amounts of oxytocin
which makes her child very precious to
her
when oxytocin flows a mother is willing
to forget her sleep her Comfort she's
willing to sacrifice herself for her
baby and it's unconditional love
how many of you have experienced this
love for your child
not only your child but also for
anyone's side
the truth is
this love often disappears between a
mother and child as the mother begins to
live more and more from stress and
anxiety around one's children
you cease to be a loving nurturer but
instead become a complaining and a
judging parent
do you know why
a state of consciousness
our body chemistry they're closely
connected
there is one state which the mother
gives into it stops the secretion of
oxytocin
can you guess what that state is
it is the state of aggressive ambition
when as a mother you become obsessed
that your child has to become number one
when you become obsessed that your child
has to be greater than another child
then competition sits in
sits into your own mind and that stops
the oxytocin flowing in your body
because your child becomes yet another
tool for your greatness
that is when you disconnect from your
child's beauty disconnect from what your
child is actually feeling Within
and then you judge your child
whenever you compare your child with
another or judge your child your child
begins to feel lonely
even though they are with you
and a disconnected child with withdrawal
into say a world of video games or
addictions and bad friendships
and the stress of being judged by you
shrinks their hippocampus in the brain
destroying their memory only when your
heart comes awake with sensitivity for
what your child is feeling and if you
can accept your child's weakness and
strengths with love that is when your
child truly awakens to his or her
potential
that is when your child truly will
fulfill one's destiny
as a mother do you take the time to feel
what your child is feeling
it is no talk of woman is a dhangini or
a partner
do you know that the human heart has 40
000 neurons that exactly functions like
another brain in the body
the heart can feel it can decide
independent of the brain and then
communicate its decision to the brain
the heart just intuits while the brain
goes through Loops of reasoning back and
forth while both the brain and the heart
are necessary
when a woman wants to choose her life
partner it is the heart neurons that
needs to be awake most partner
relationships do not endure do you know
why
well there are numerous reasons such as
say infidelity or family pressure or
health reasons whatever
the fundamental reason why partner
relationship fails is
the shutting down of your heart
why does the heart shut down
most women have built all walls around
their hearts because of the numerous
hearts in cells and humiliations that
one has accumulated from one's parents
when they have looked down upon you
because you were a girl child
accumulated from your in-laws house
because they have not considered you as
being part of their family Hearts have
accumulated because of the society that
has judged you as not being wealthy
enough trendy enough
beautiful enough or smart enough
there are also the Heritage accumulated
from your partner until you become free
of these hurts you cannot connect to
your partner from a beautiful state of
trust you will always be suspicious of
their intentions
and you will withhold love
in Sanskrit means half the substance
half the body half the soul
as a woman please do not give in to
feelings of superiority over your
partner if you think you're Superior you
will judge the other and not love them
if you think you are inferior again you
will feel judged
and you will feel unloved
the day you become free of your hearts
that is when your heart becomes capable
of deep compassion and respect for your
partner and yourself
let us now move into the fourth aspect
of Womanhood nature or a leader
the name of the lead character in Avatar
emerged
as a woman you could be a business
leader a leader in a family a leader
who's creating a social change
or a leader in your community or your
organization most people ask me
how can you play so many roles as a wife
as a as a mother as a daughter as a
daughter-in-law as a spiritual teacher
and as a leader of many organizations
and that's a Mystic I would say you two
can do it if you lived in a state of
connection if you lived in a state of
connection you will be present to people
be it your team your family you'll be
present to your problems and your
challenges you'll be able to
experience immense guidance from the
universal elements
if you do not come from a beautiful
state of connection and presence then
every role will become a burden you will
feel overwhelmed
you will either sacrifice your family
for your career you would sacrifice your
health for a career or you would
sacrifice your spiritual growth for your
family or your career
that is the most important teaching I
want to give Every Woman
if you aspire to be a leader don't make
your success or your failure about
yourself
you must have a bigger purpose your
business your career must have a larger
purpose of making a difference
it must cause greater good in the world
it is only when your career has a higher
purpose only then you'll be able to be
completely present
and flow with
profits
flow with the problems if not for this
greater purpose you will lose your
femininity
you will become masculine aggressive and
ruthless
and this will bring dissatisfaction in
other areas of your life

RKokNcjdHB4,Congress Digvijaya Singh Thanks Germany For &#39;Taking Note&#39; Of Rahul Gandhi&#39;s Disqualification,Congress leader Digvijaya Singh has thanked Germany for 'taking note' of Rahul Gandhi's disqualification from the Parliament ...,2023-03-30T04:48:29Z,TIMES NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RKokNcjdHB4/hqdefault.jpg,"now the congress party has also reacted
after Germany's statement has tweeted
saying thank you Germany Foreign Affairs
Ministry for taking note of how the
democracy is being compromised in India
through persecution of Rahul Gandhi
that's the latest uh first and perhaps
first reaction coming in from the
congress party after uh Germany reacted
over this democracy debate which has
erupted here in India previously it was
the United States which waded Into The
Rao uh wherein the BJP also responded
saying that this is the internal matter
of India let me go across to my
colleague Mohit was joining us over the
phone line first reaction from congress
party after Germany uh weighted into the
Democracy debate all right we'll try to
open the my colleague back on the
broadcast for more developments on the
story but of course it is only going uh
going to add fuel uh to the fire because
uh already the Congress and the BJP are
at loggerheads uh when it comes to Rahul
Gandhi's remarks back in London which
was uh made just a few weeks back which
also opened a political war of words
between the two parties who are in India
and uh Mohit with Germany now also
wading into this debate Congress has
welcomed the uh statement which has been
made by the country uh saying and
perhaps thanking the country for taking
note of how the democracy is being
compromised in India as what they say
well you see you know the BJP has been
saying this that it has been uh what
Rahul Gandhi wanted that the U.S and UK
to enter into Internal Affairs of India
that has been done when we saw the
statement coming in from uh United
States Deputy spokesperson and after
that we saw that how the political part
uh uh erupted between the BJP and the
congress party while the Congress has
been saying this that Rahul Gandhi did
not want intervention from U.S or UK in
fact he asked for the their media to
look into the matters of India but we
see again that Germany has also German
foreign Ministry spokesperson for the
first time perhaps I've commented on the
issue of the Rahul Gandhi's
disqualification where they have stated
that they have taken note of the vertex
of the suspension of Rahul Gandhi from
the parliament now appeal will show
whether what extent and suspension has
basis and they also say that they expect
the standards of judicial Independence
and Democratic principles will be
applied now we see that how big Vijay
Singh a senior Congress leader has also
welcomed uh the statement that has come
in uh from Germany Foreign Affairs
Ministry uh and he has also stated that
he thanks the Germany Foreign Affairs
Ministry for taking note of how
democracy is being compromised in India
through persecution of Rahul Gandhi so
again a strong statement coming in from
the congress party leader where he says
that the Democracy in country is
compromised in India too persecution of
Rahul Gandhi so we have to wait and
watch how will BJP reply to this because
BJP has been saying this that Rahul
Gandhi on foreign land has defamed
demean and insulting our democracy and
here also asked for the intervention of
foreign countries like U.S and UK to
intervene into the internal affairs of
India and perhaps uh the BJP will say
that this is what is happening
yes of course and we also heard uh the
BJP when the U.S also made similar kinds
of uh remarks just a few days back only
were in the congress party also came in
defense saying that the world will of
course react as uh they see what is
happening here in India so uh let's also
listen in to what exactly in fact United
States also said in terms of this entire
debate
respect for the rule of law and judicial
Independence is a Cornerstone of any
democracy and we're watching Mr Gandhi's
case in Indian courts and we engage with
the government of India on our shared uh
commitment to democratic values
including of course freedom of
expression in our engagements with our
Indian Partners we continue to highlight
the importance of democratic principles
and the protection of Human Rights
including freedom of expression as a key
to strengthening both our democracies
of course it is to be seen how the bgp
is going to react to the latest remark
coming in from Germany because
previously also when United States made
such remarks questions were being made
as to the local standard of the country
making this remark also the party said
that this is our internal matter
well yes in fact and when this question
was being asked from Union Minister
Smith Irani who was addressing the press
conference she stated that this is not
what Rahul Gandhi wanted when he asked
for UK and U.S intervention into the
internal affairs of the country but you
see Congress has been saying this that
Rahul did not ask for the intervention
of U.S and UK into the internal matters
of the country or the Democratic
institutes in the country in fact he
highlighted the issues that were that
are prevalent in our country so again we
see that the German foreign Ministry has
stated that they have taken note of the
disqualification of Rahul Gandhi and
they have also stated that they hope
that the judicial process and appeal
will be followed so clearly again we see
the whole lot of political words uh will
come up from the BJP because BJP has
been saying this that this is happening
because of Rahul Gandhi going to London
demeaning insulting our educational uh
constitutional institutes demeaning and
insulting our democracy and seeking the
foreign intervention that first it was
the United States and now there reaction
has come in from Germany and we see that
how exactly which are saying senior
Congress leader has welcomed it and he
has also say that he also said that the
Germany has taken note of the
persecution of Rahul Gandhi and the
democracy is being throttled in the
country so this might turn into another
fight between the BJP and the congress
party over the issue so we have to wait
and watch how exactly the BJP will
respond to this because BJP will surely
come out as earlier they said that this
is what Rahul Gandhi wanted that the
foreign powers should also talk note of
what is happening in the country yes of
course and it also seems Mohit that with
Germany also now wading Into The Rao it
is somewhere going to put Rahul Gandhi
once again at the top spot because
previously also he came forward
defending his remarks saying that he did
not seek any foreign intervention while
making that statement back in London
however with now two countries
commenting over over uh the democracy
and the rules of law that should be
applied in the case of course it is
going to put somewhere the Congress
leader at a tough spot
now he goes on to say the thank you
Germany Foreign Affairs Ministry and
Richard Walker for taking note of how
the democracy is being compromised in
India through persecution for
interrupting I come back to you",True,en,1187,22,16

coming back with some more updates
Sparks flew at a parliamentary
consultative committee meeting which was
shared by external affairs minister SJ
Shankar and what exactly happened is uh
that at the meeting SJ Shankar gave a
detailed presentation on the G20
presidency to the committee members and
Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was among
the opposition members who were present
at the meeting navasca sauces uh the
issue of political leaders trying to
score brownie points by talking about
Indian democracy on foreign land was
raised and after which a heated
discussion took place let me go across
through my colleague Sab srg who is
joining us live in the broadcast what
exactly ensued when his presentation was
being made and Rahul Gandhi's uh Speech
in London was indirectly rigged up
during this speech
well absolutely uh see another
controversy had sparked surrounding uh
Mr Gandhi and it happened at the mea
committee meeting uh where as Jai
Shankar was uh was coordinating this
meeting with other political party uh
leaders and he was giving a detailed
report on India's G20 presidency uh
where Rahul Gandhi was present and in
that particular meeting as per sources
and MP had indirectly attacked Mr Gandhi
stating that some leaders in the
parliament are trying to score brownie
points by uh stating India's name in
foreign soil and that's why Mr Gandhi
reacted he's stating that this
particular statement has been indirectly
hinted towards him and he said he also
said that his particular attack is
against an individual not against the
government and why the government is
agitated so much and on the other hand
as we know that from the sources that Mr
s Jai Shankar was also Furious because
this was particular meeting was focused
on the detailed
inputs on India's G20 presidency but the
entire meeting was uh sparked by
controversies surrounding Mr Gandhi's
statement uh several BJP MPS who were
present in the meeting clearly stated
that this was not the platform for this
sort of discussion this sort of
discussion can happen inside the
parliament but it is about g20's
presidency and some uh information some
important information was being given by
the uh Minister and this particular time
Rahul Gandhi once again sparked the
controversy whereas the Congress MP have
come in defense has said that Rahul
Gandhi has the right to clarify himself
because he's been not allowed to speak
inside the parliament so he has a right
to clarify himself when the government
has been attacking him over his
statement in in the UK
yes of course that exactly what happened
because at the meeting as the Shankar
was giving a detailed presentation on
the G20 presidency uh when an indirect
reference to Rahul Gandhi's speech in
London uh was being made during the
meeting in Rahul Gandhi interjected
saying that the remarks made in London
were about a specific individual and not
the government however later on is what
we're learning as resources that one of
the bgp members countered saying that
this is not a right platform to discuss
this issue but sabasachi of course we
have been seeing what has been happening
in the parliament with both the Congress
and the BJP at the loggerheads even in
fact 18 opposition the latter remains
adamant saying that they have not been
given a chance to give a clarification
over the comments and the uh the the
entire issue that opposition is being
silenced Still Remains is what has been
claimed by the congress party
is going to uh continue in the
parliament as well uh the BJP has been
mounting attack on Mr Gandhi stating
that Mr Gandhi had to uh had to
apologize uh in the house for demeaning
India's democracy and raising question
on India's democracy in the foreign soil",True,en,2688,7,23

we're deeply grateful to our Indian
partners for the way they have led the
G20 to date and as you alluded to there
is a lot more work to be done over the
course of this year but India is off to
a very promising start with its
stewardship of the G20
swept in to drive their agenda G20
foreign ministers met in New Delhi on
March 1st and 2nd under India's G20
presidency with the theme was
as the voice of global South India has
been busy trying to balance the East and
the West with the air of acrimony at G20
India managed very difficult balancing
act in a typical display of the thrust
and Barry of world politics
we have a relationship with Moscow we've
had a long-term relationship with Moscow
I think it's important to look at that
history of the relationship it was a
relationship built in a period when
Western democracy is used to arm a
military dictatorship called Pakistan
and deny India defensive weapons so we
are talking about principles let's talk
a little bit of History out here India
has long tried in itself on its
strategically independent foreign policy
as the Russia Ukraine war escalated on
February 24 2022 a major geopolitical
crisis erupted India is among the few
democracies in the world that have
abstained from U.N resolutions during
the Ukraine war however one must not
forget that Russia and China are
excellent friends with the Moscow
backing Beijing since 1962. India and
China Russia's most consequential
strategic partners and geopolitics is a
lot like playing chess
Russia has never sacrificed its ties
with India to please China also Moscow
has never backed New Delhi against
Beijing while maintaining its neutrality
uh you know we we have a difficult
relationship China
we're perfectly capable of managing it
it's uh if if I get Global understanding
and support obviously it is of help to
me but this idea that I do a transaction
that I come in in one conflict because
it will help me in Conflict too that's
not how the world works
so a lot of our problems in China have
nothing to do with Ukraine have nothing
to do with Russia they predict it
volunteer bought weapons from Russia
Pakistan is dependent on Ukraine for the
same Russia's special military operation
in Ukraine has already become a classic
example of power games and forgotten
commitments the war of propaganda has
exposed many relations there are no
permanent friends or enemies in the
international relations as China
Pakistan relations strengthened it
Pakistan's weapon trade with Ukraine Got
reduced back in 1950 West co-opted
Pakistan into the Western military
system through a series of packs such as
Sito and Cento and in an exchange the
U.S France and Britain among others
poured military aid into the dirt poor
country
foreign
partner of toys for the United States in
a in a number of spaces and that
includes uh trade cooperation uh it of
course includes security cooperation uh
it also includes technological
cooperation as well
as often in the middle of geopolitical
States China and Russia Russia and their
relations are undergoing a major change
India's long economic relationship with
Russia has become increasingly
problematic for the United States
however New Delhi wants to remain a
Eurasian power swinging between East and
West according to its priorities amid
Russia Ukraine war and China's agenda to
position itself on the world stage to
manage Global Affairs Biden's America is
placing modi's India at the center of
its ambition seeking to cement ties with
one of the world's fastest growing
economies
the United States may not like India's
ties with Russia but it seems willing to
accept them as the necessary price for
keeping India on board in dealing with
the rising China
India will buy oil from wherever it has
to for the simple reason that this kind
of a discussion cannot be taken to the
consuming
population of India
America not only needs India in the
indo-pacific but also like
East Asia however India has always
remained Guided by a principle of
strategic autonomy which sought to
maximize its policy making freedom of
movement New Delhi avoids commitments
like formal alliances and maintains
Partnerships based on issues rather than
on a particular ideology

thank you
if you look at the whole article 370
issue I mean let's be honest other than
the politics of the day what was the
reason for a temporary provision to
continue so long it was really the
politics of the day and the fact that we
had such a uh sort of messy issue there
I mean the entire world used it for the
last 75 years Kashmir situation is often
misrepresented or misunderstood in
Washington what is the current
understanding of U.S lawmakers about
Kashmir and terrorism there if there is
a terrorist incident
and it doesn't matter what faith the
person you know who's killed
if there are Indian soldiers or Indian
policemen who are abducted or killed
if there are people working for the
government
or you know citizens going about their
business
who who lose their lives
how often do you hear people talking
about it you know
announcing on it there's a big song and
dance about internet uh being cut okay
now if you have reached a stage where
you say an internet cut is is
more dangerous than the loss of human
lives then what can I say

g-u3LhLkduY,"BBC, Soros And Now NYT, &#39;Fiction&#39; Peddled As Fact | Why Fan &#39;Anti-India&#39; Hate? | Newshour",In this episode of Meghna Deka's Newshour centers on the recent negative attention India has been receiving from various ...,2023-03-11T04:41:43Z,TIMES NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g-u3LhLkduY/hqdefault.jpg,"well after sorrow strike and the BBC
Blitz now comes the nyt attack
repeatedly India is being bashed and its
democracy maligned by the non-state
actors and agenda-driven foreign
ecosystem but why and to what end well
this time once again it is the New York
Times an opinion piece written by Andra
Basin of the Kashmir times has sparked
this controversy in her op-ed she says
that the repressive media policies are
destroying kashmiri journalism and media
Outlets are being intimidated into
serving as Government mouthpiece she
also says that the government is
creating information vacuum in the
region of Kashmir of 13 million
inhabitants and Kashmir may not survive
Prime Minister Modi the op-ed also
alleges that digital media Amendments
have been made to block content that the
Modi government does not like that these
are just some of the claims being made
against the Indian government however
the opposition has wholeheartedly
endorsed this propaganda as it has been
called out by the BJP hailing it as the
absolute truth
if a line or two or a paragraph
something get
published in any newspaper media and
they say that
and if the uh the things go against them
then they say that it's a propaganda
is such a contradiction now when the
truth is being covered with them because
they are not in they don't accept the
truth what they accept is that one side
that there should be praise and praise
and uh
no negative side or real size should be
shown yeah
but is the nyt trying to paint fiction
as facts let's put out some of the data
it has hailed the separatists leader
Sayed Alisha gilani as one of the
Towering figures of separatism what it
does not say is that NC had accused the
gilani of being on isi's payroll in fact
he was charged with sedition in 2010 a
case of FEMA violation was also
registered against him in 2019. this
article also equates the BBC survey to
suppression of facts what it does not
say is that the income tax department
sources had said that the BBC was
non-compliant with its rules of India
also there is non-compliance in the
transfer of pricing rules and deliberate
diversion of amounts for profit was the
allegation on it it also says that
thousands of innocent homes were
bulldozed and they were left homeless
however what it does not say is that one
of the homes belonged to ashik nenru for
example his home 2 was demolished Nengo
was unaccused on the Pulver attack
John's house was also raised kulam Navi
was designated a terrorist under uapa
these important parts are also not
pointed out in this article but let's
remind you of nyt's rather checkout past
as well should it be the goal post when
it comes to what truth is remember NYIT
was called out for its political bias
for not adequately reporting on
allegations of corruption against Joe
Biden's son Hunter Biden nyt gave an
open platform to assafali sardari in
2008 the then president of Pakistan to
distance his government from the 26-11
attacks nyt gave an open platform to
Imran Khan to attack India's abrogation
of article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir
something which was completely an
internal matter nyd had described Jammu
and Kashmir as living hell of anger and
fear in August 2019. nyt had claimed in
May 2021 that India's covered death toll
is the worst in the world and could be
more than 10 times what was officially
reported nyd was also forced to
apologize for its cartoon mocking the
Mongolian in October 2014. but let's
also remind you of the antecedents of
the author of this article and rather
have a scene well she is a frequent
attendee of isi sponsored events as per
some of the agencies also she has opened
me back to isi operations led by gulab
nabifa he's of course one of the
convicts and firmly absolved Phi in the
receiving funds from isi invited to
event where 5 was also presented as one
of the speakers he of course is the
daughter of Wade Basin who is a stance
supporter and known supporter of isi
operations in Kashmir Phi even had
written a piece on Ved bhasin after his
death in that orbit he had glorified
Basin made bhasin remember had also
attended isi-funded events all of this
is part of the facts you're watching the
NewsHour first debate number two on
times now super prime time
is also joining us a political land list
my first question is going to be for you
we have seen after Soros there's been
Hindenburg there has been Washington
Post articles now there is New York
Times yet again is this a concerted
strike of non-state actors
actively maligning India and its
democracy when they are far removed from
it
Magna cyber firstly what you forgot to
tell were the viewers about the New York
Times is that on Gandhi jayanti in 2019
there was an article
why India and the world need Gandhi and
that
you can buy none other than
that but you didn't tell that because
that day in Europe times was supposed to
be a good paper the other day is
supposed to be the bad paper and I'll
seek a reply to this from Dr ranganathan
but second Point yes verily there's
ruthless corruption in Jammu and Kashmir
Administration modiji's funds are being
rooted but the newspaper whichever
rights against corruption is denied
government advertisements and any reason
who speaks against that corruption which
is
wanted to highlight because maybe she is
also a victim that she is not getting
her share of advertisements the
government advertisements because
government advertisement has become a
new conspiracy against the Modi
government that the one who writes
against corruption is denied government
advertisement the general speaks against
corruption is highest so it is something
for modiji to check what is wrong with
jnk Administration it's not me to blame
anybody but yes one important point when
you talk about New York Times
victim you use the word victim let me go
across the sushil pundit also who's
joining us he is an activist so she'll
pundit because
you two are a representative of
kashmirandi who decides who is the true
representative who is the fake
representative do you share the views of
Anuradha Basin by simple questions
I'm far from it
is the daughter of a father with Basin
and as they say the fruit doesn't fall
far from the tree gulanda Bai wrote a
fawning obituary when Wade Basim died
was arrested by United States of America
for spying in U.S on behalf of isi and
he served time there he is the one who
organized conference circuits junkets
for Indian journalists retired
bureaucrats and busy buddies in ngos to
come and conference on jnk on Kashmir on
occupation of India in Kashmir on human
rights violations in Kashmir in the Garb
of representing people
this is who Anuradha bhasin is show me
one article she has written all her life
about the genocide of Hindus in Kashmir
Valley show me one article about human
rights violations of kashmiri Muslims
within Kashmir at the hands of jihadris
she is and has always been a hurry up
representative in media debates she has
always represented she is a separatist
point of view
she has never let us feel the absence of
guriath in media debates
she has always represented a separatist
point of view
and this is a continuation of the Legacy
she represents in the newspaper and her
own father
that Legacy continues and one of the
things and I must point this out to Dr
Anand ranganathan also I'll come back to
you
one of the things that she had said that
her own newspaper office was stormed
then they locked it up again one of the
selective things which was not pointed
out in this article was that building
was sealed in question was allotted to
Wade bhasin her father by the government
her father in 1994 then the government
reserves the right to take it back after
the death of the allotti that is what
had happened do you think that you can
look at Anuradha Basin as a neutral
Observer and unbiased journalist
reporting the facts on the ground as nyt
would have his belief
maybe not she is as much a neutral
Observer as Pakistani empires of the
1980s look where else would a
propagandist write but in a pamphlet
produced by a propaganda Factory called
the nyt
I wouldn't even honestly wrap my
kachoris in New York Times for fear of
all that toxicity bleeding on to them to
paraphrase Kennedy ask number one this
is what he said verbatim India is a
bigger enemy of Islam and Muslims than
even Israel two Muslims are a calm
wholly separate from the Hindus the
basis of the unit is Islam and Islam
alone three accession to India would
result in the kashmiri Muslims having to
live perpetually under Hindu slavery for
Kashmir must become an Islamic State
unquote these are the same journalist
meghna and their children who were
silent when refugees one of the two lakh
West Pakistan refugees who ran for their
life and settle in Kashmir when melu RAM
and his children were barred from local
jobs and Welfare schemes when dalit
radhika Gill her family was brought to
Kashmir to work as sweepers in 1957.
radhika cleared the BFS entrance exam
but radhika could only get a job as a
sweeper because she wasn't a domicile
when for 70 years the human rights of
lacks of
delighted in saying and I quote him they
want to abolish 370 and will remain
silent inshallah we will fight we dare
them Allah would want that vegan
independence from India unquote these
are the same Journal which is 30 seconds
who were silent when they three years
ago Supreme Court diabolically rejected
reopening cases of criminal doesn't
against Kashmir Hindu because God too
much time had elapsed and these same
journalists are silently seeing now
because while three years to 2019 3686
law in order incidents three years since
2019 the number is only 430 Terror
attacks have reduced by 14 in 2018.
sorry 10 seconds but there is one thing
one has learned over the years it is
that you cannot cure these propagandists
they are like the rat Beach their every
drop of blood spawns more on the same
final 10 seconds there are three
parallels you have right now I pose one
question I will
article foreign
is a terrorist he wants to ask if you
will openly call him out today
what I know is that there are newspapers
in Jammu which are Modi box which says
but they are denied advertisements
because they write against Corrections
you want me to repeat the same question
should I keep repeating the same
question I'll ask you a second question
I'll ask you a separate question you
really don't want to answer that I'll
ask you a different question I'll change
the question you're not giving me an
answering you say that she's Fair
impartial she's talking about the
kashmiris how much of investigative work
has she done about the Hindu genocide
which has happened in Kashmir tell us
about list us the mha has never taken
what has she done for the Hindus who I
think all of us have accepted have they
victimized their face one of the longest
programs in the world what is the
investigative word which has been done
what is the fight for justice
organization here's another question for
you is the separatist organization
more than you can chew
you have bitten more than you can choose
okay you got exposed by brother my
brother you got exposed tonight is not a
Muslim please understand it please thank
you I am honestly speaking I don't
understand why her religion has anything
to do with it
go ahead
was inaugurated by meghna's father in
Jammu
20 years ago can you believe this
stands banned today whose leadership is
in the jail today
has not been banned please don't tell
lies on the national TV please please
don't support yourself
leadership
is in jail
foreign
leadership by successive governments
have been patronized from the heads of
the states to even former Prime
Ministers they have been patronized
they've got and given this Long Leash so
what if today one person comes out and
says that you have the Towering figure
of Syed Alisha gilani what's wrong there
are prama prime ministers who've met him
can I please
away from answering questions and and
that is that is how I'm built so I'll
answer all the three questions I
completely condemn and castigate the bgp
I have for not Banning PFI which they
did I have been Banning I've been
creating a free I condemn it for not I
have declaring huriyath as a terrorist
organization I condemn it or not uh you
know declaring as a terrorist number two
I also condemned Narendra Modi for
writing for New York Times but I know I
have already said that this before it is
for him candid very fair very candid
answer by Dr ranganathan unfortunately
we are running out of time but the big
question continues to remain who and why
has been fueling the anti-india hate
especially in the international
ecosystem I leave it there thank you so
much all our viewers for joining us all
our panelists for putting your views
forth here on NewsHour at night
thank you",True,en,6947,48,104
kOLbfHFrLCo,Newshour Live | ED Submits Sisodia Dossier In Court; Will AAP Pay The Price In 2024? | Padmaja,India Upfront Lve | ED Submits Sisodia Dossier In Court; Will AAP Pay The Price In 2024? | Rahul #englishnewslive ...,2023-03-10T17:50:33Z,TIMES NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kOLbfHFrLCo/hqdefault.jpg,"yeah you are today basing this entire
allegation that you have made against
the enforcement directed on the fact
that no money has been recovered in any
of these raids
but as I have brought out and even
punawala today
is not standing
Toe to Toe shoulder to shoulder with the
ahmadmi party you may have a general
Grouse against the Ed because after all
the Ed has gone after his sambandhan but
you have invoked a very interesting
very interesting argument no money
recovered so you must be innocent
now I have shown you examples in the
past
where the ahmadmi party hasn't given
this benefit of doubt
to either Modi or Dr Manmohan saying
or several others like Arun jaitley who
the app had to apologize to
so why should there be a different
yardstick for sisodia and a different
one from Prime Minister Modi
the former prime minister
Dr Manmohan saying
for the late
venerable Mr jaitley and a completely
different set of yardsticks for Mr
sisodia why
all right
like uh as as we have in the panel gvl
sir 2
and is the discussion about accusation
and the corruption even sir from the BJP
panel accused suchna Chaudhary and CM
Ramesh and termed them as Andhra malias
and uh I I uh I want to ask how many
times he got uh
like got into the jail and uh what
happened to the case and everything
because you're talking about some 210
crores Camp which Edie referred as
six percent of the turnover of
all the companies
or around the 3500 crore of indoor
spirits and everything turnover it's out
of six percent will be given to up every
year is the irrigation
and you termed it has already the money
was sent and used
and even the lawyer said there is out of
58 pages of application there is no
money trail that was linked to sisodia
and if you see after the new policy has
happened
uh there is a rule that there is no need
of
selling it MRP price which means out of
the 12 percent where the retailer have
the margin they can even sell it
with very Less Price also if you
consider this I want to know where uh
how they are able to generate the money
without even the margin and give it to
Mani sisodia which that was alleged
because it's always said a six person to
twelve percent was increased the other
six percent is directly go to the
pockets of sisodiaji yeah
funny bhushan I didn't ask you that
question maybe you misunderstood my
question my question was straightforward
I wanted to know the yardsticks that
have been used by the app I'll get to GB
and nurse tomorrow don't worry I have
his letter in fact the one that he wrote
uh
um
I have that here who is The Honorable
chairman of the Ethics Committee of
rajya sabhai it's right here and he
wrote about the malias but that I'll
come back to I just want to ask you Mr
bhushan it's a very simple
straightforward question
you have said that no money has been
recovered from money to sodia so he must
be innocent he's our Ram he's mariada
purush
but no money was recovered in the Sahara
birla Diaries accusation
from Narendra Modi the current prime
minister
neither was it recovered from Dr
Manmohan saying who you said played a
stellar role in the Colgate Scandal
neither was it recovered from Arun
jaitly the late Arun jaitly
who you said was corrupt and was
carrying out all sorts of underhand
practices in the ddca so I just want to
ask you sir
why should Manisha sodia
be judged by a different yardstick and
the others not
you didn't answer my question can you
answer this
can I take that Rahul no it's okay I'll
come to you in a few moments yeah I want
to answer like uh there is one there is
one easy narrative that's keep going on
uh if you are in BJP and get cases on
you telling me you will be so you are
also making you were also making shoot
and Scoot allegations like the BJP makes
against it's like no against prime
minister Narendra Modi and against the
former prime minister Dr Manu Singh just
answer me that if you think that it's
okay to throw Kitchen on everybody it's
fine that's okay exactly who have CBA
and Ed in their hand let us talk only
about investigation in this case
let us restrict ourselves to that yeah
yeah but he's not you see the point is
the point is Mr bhushan believes that
we're all fools
that the app can go and demand people's
resignation sack them hang them but when
it comes to their own leader we
shouldn't because they are Ram
or their prahlades so I want to ask you
funny bhushan again please I'm badgering
you a little bit you need to come clean
on this you say others should resign but
your leader is rum
when corruption allegations are made why
and if you see the fastness of the case
in this just sisodia Case by the time
CBI is uh bail trial was about to start
answering my questions
we can go into this all night I can I
can ask you this and you will Dodge and
the viewer will realize that there is
something wrong here we can do this the
whole night I have a lot of time on my
hands but I'm going to open this up
investigation they had a solid proof it
is
they have depositions sir they have
WhatsApp messages they put them here
this is the big
document that has been submitted you see
how thick it is how many pages it is
should I read out the material they have
collected you see my point is that they
are claiming solid proof
there WhatsApp chats
several of them not just one
they have depositions of people
uh so I want you to explain now money
trail of Kickbacks received on page 40
views on page 40 the Ed claims people
and other South group
sir here it is Raul shall I simplify it
for okay ready wants to step in former
Bengaluru who was with the Ahmad sorry
uh
sorry bhaskarao steps select Mr Funny
bhushan be clear yeah if if anybody is
called for investigation by an
investigative authority over there if
they are not able to answer the
questions and give evasive answers at
that time and the investigation officer
has got
sufficient information to see that he
can throw light on that but he is
evasing giving evasive answer such a
person is sent to judicial custody and
which brought back so that he comes back
once again to give proper answers over
there and the amount of evidence that is
already there on paper not created by
anybody else created by the Delhi
government by making a U-turn on that by
making a correction and by unilaterally
with the drawing Etc because there are
two three aspects to it the first aspect
is the flaw in the policy and later
making you turn out of it and then
trying to bring about a policy in such a
great hurry trying to see that a bigger
evil is controlled but actually what has
happened the government abdicated its
responsibility and things just went
absolutely out of control and
the proceeds the proceeds for completely
privatizing went to the southern
group or Southern chapter which you have
been mentioning over there yeah but
these are all allegations I want to ask
you Mr bhaskara one second you were with
the ahmadmi party
you were a vice president of the ahmadmi
party in your state and I want to ask
you this question it's a very important
question
has today the ahmadmi party
lost the moral High Ground on corruption
and that to a year before the 2024
elections the Congress lost it in 2014
it cost them will they are pay I want to
ask you since you quit the app why did
you quit the app
because there was total lack of
transparency in the decision making and
what they say and what they do there is
a lot of variance in that
I had thought that this is going to be a
straightforward thing in fact in this
liquor case itself when we were doing
door-to-door campaigning people used to
ask what is happening over here we
expected at least I sent information I
wanted information that put out a white
paper at least give an example of what
your innocence is that come out clean
and say what exactly you did and what
has gone wrong if a white paper was
there highlighting what all had happened
over there people would have got
convinced so if there is such a kind of
a cloak of secrecy over there how you
have taken decisions over there now
calling yourself from one of us and
making an emotional appeal to Children
Etc that doesn't cut eyes our
when I was in Ahmad the party the
workers used to say how do we answer
such questions when people ask us sir
get us some information from Delhi how
we can answer so many times we brought
it to the notice of our local president
to bring the answers from there in fact
there is a Ravi Shankar committee which
is a wonderful committee which gave
recommendations earlier also over there
he was a joint Commissioner of excise
here and how government of Karnataka
does this over there but they never
brought out anything of that kind so I
would yes I would say that yes the moral
High Ground is lost
its USP that's the charge very quick
response from tehsin punawala very
quickly
in corruption
well to lose High Ground you have to be
on High Ground these are a bunch of
people who came in who preached morality
to the entire world and now the roosters
have come home to roost as the same goes
so for me from the time of Anna hazare I
think that this particular movement and
these this party had no moral High
Ground so there are a lot of questions
as Bhaskar Audi said rightly that needs
to be answered which is but there are
more important questions which The
Honorable MP is not going to ask and The
Honorable MP will never be able to
answer these questions then how sir is
it that under the CBI 124 rates are
taking place 118 on the opposition and
just six on BJP in its allies how under
the enforcement directorate 121 rates
takes place 115 on the opposition and
just five on the BJP and it's allies
with a magically easy rate because
and it's become an instrument of Magic
The Magic is I can give you three names
the BJP right
investigation is going on he comes
miraculously to the bgp investigation
stops he goes back to the TMC
investigation stuff and so is the case
with Ajit why does the EB act like an
arm of the BJP even with regards to
Manisha who I think has a lot to answer
with the jlbt ACT 1991 the transaction
of Business Schools 1993 Delhi excisex
2009 daily excise rule 2010 all of these
questions needed to be asked but why
couldn't he be summon him before today
only Eve when his bail is going to be
decided Indie now comes and decides that
Manisha so there should be taken into
custody why does the EV act as an arm of
the bhartiya janta party okay it's the
simple question okay let me ask because
this is what I anticipated now Mr
bhushan began by saying I'm seeing the
Member of Parliament from the bharatiya
janta party jivial he said I have a
letter and I have that letter also in
that letter sir you say as a champion of
public issues leaders like you have said
high standards for people entering
public life I am writing to bring to
your kind notice serious breach of
ethics on part of two members of rajya
Sabha namely CM Ramesh and Mr Vayas
Chaudhary both are involved in
allegation the massive financial
bungling and fraud the IDI also put out
a tweet with the number on it the amount
that wise Chaudhary has supposed to have
basically usurped
5700 crores and diverted them into
several shell companies etc etc and you
have attached documentary proof yet sir
Mr Chaudhary was taken in by the
bharatiya janta party and not prosecuted
so number one
the Ed therefore seems to have or maybe
the government that reports that the Ed
reports to which is your government has
lost credibility to make this case even
you can't take the moral High Ground
today
thank you Rahul for the opportunity let
me make three points I'll come to the
point your question you asked as the
third Point okay because it's uh it has
a particular flow Point number one
office what is money laundering because
Mr Mani sodia is being charged under
pmla Act offerings of money laundering
which is described in the chapter two of
the pmla ACT it says it doesn't talk
about the recovery of Hard Cash and
things like it says this is the only
definition of money laundering whosoever
directly or indirectly attempts to
indulge or knowingly assist or knowingly
is a party or he is actually involved in
any process or activity connected with
the proceeds of crime and projecting it
as untainted property shall be guilty of
office of offense of money laundering
so they have already talked about 100
crores having been paid through the
hawala road I'm sure Edie will
substantiates its own findings and if
that is established I think you don't
need to recover hard currency from the
bed of Manisha sodia or from his uh
drawing room
as long as
it has been done with his knowledge or
with his uh uh with his complicity or
knowledge indirectly or directly he can
be punished under this particular answer
sir sir you are giving me a lecture
I'm coming to your point just give me
give me 30 seconds
okay go ahead sir hello yeah go ahead
I'm listening to you Rahul just 30
seconds I'll take second
why are so many cases uh the second
question was
testing asks why is Ed and CPA why are
the most cases against opposition
leaders we have been in government for
nearly nine years now
have you been able to charge
modiji's government even with one case
of corruption
has there been any attained or any
involvement of any minister in any
misread or or misappropriation but sir
investigators one second if you control
the investigating agency
one second if you control the
investigating agency's uh then how does
anyone look for anything
why am I looking the opposition is
making false allegations and that's the
end of the case this is what is
happening well I'm giving you no no why
you have to answer my questions so all
this Prelude is great
a preamble we are not writing the
Constitution here I am only asking you a
simple question one individual one
individual why is Chaudhary yes of
corruption could you level against us no
no one second one second I'll tell you
why is Chaudhary one second why is
Chaudhary the living example
one second Mr Mr Rao one second I'm
dealing with uh jivial narsima Rao one
second
why is Chaudhary you said
was involved in a scam coming to it no
to the tune of 5700 crores and that the
Ed has found this and the Ed has found
that but you take Vice
Chaudhary into your party first of all
why did you take a corrupt person that
you accused of corruption into your
party number one number two then the Ed
goes away
there's been no arrest he is not keep
showing in jail hasn't gone away no no I
you please get your facts right
get your facts right any any charge that
existed as of that day I said he has
gone away
I'm not saying the case has gone away I
said the Ed has gone away they have not
arrested him why is he not arrested this
is the amount 5700 crores sisodia has
taken 290 you will have to you will have
to get your law Rahul I can tell you
there has never been any any let up or
any reprieve given to anybody but we
have admitted him into the party that's
a fact I will have to admit why do you
take a person
A Member of Parliament from the BJP said
is corrupt there is never been any these
are the words
the case of Ys Chaudhary is even more
dangerous as his business operations
remain shady and it seemed thousand
crores have been borrowed using
political clout and patronage
this is your letter yet sir your party
took him in
such a dangerous person which are
dubious sources of money it could be
dawood's money who's to know you
yourself have made these claims dubious
money Shady why is he in your why is he
in your pocket
sir this is uh this is amazing no no no
no I I think don't question he he
whatever whatever he borrowed was from
the banks for business purposes there
were certainly allegations there was an
answer
have been borrowed using political clout
in patronage
if he's borrowed sir from Banks
withdrawn my statement or has the Ed
withdrawn the case to the best of my
knowledge
there has never been any reprint okay
listen is he in custody sir in fact no
he has got public money no Mr one second
let me bring in Mr Rao Mr Bhaskar I was
trying to this is out to you let me ask
you Mr Bhaskar why has why is Chaudhary
not been arrested no investigative
agency yeah I will answer your I will
answer their questions see when the
allegations like this fly or that
letters are written etc etc by someone
then then they are taken to a party Etc
you said that the allegations have
brought been have the case remains but
that Ed has gone away no it is not back
there no investigative agency has got
parmadika or sarvadikar saying that they
are the end all and B all over there the
same Supreme Court gives relief to
everybody who has approached it over
there if you have found that such and
such a person has had such a kind of
allegation against them you
come to a conclusion over there
foreign
it is not the question of individuals
I'm talking about institution that
institution has gone away over there you
bring back the institution by a
constitutional order over there from the
Supreme Court over there
out of God
this is the most hilarious argument
there is no point
because he's not making any sense he's
leaving the owners not on the agencies
not even on the BJP but on others now to
file cases to arrest Mr Chaudhary look
at the ridiculous roughness of all of
this please don't make a joke out of
things sir please you're a responsible

because this is not the BJP
you need to respond everyone is saying
that there is something wrong here
if you ask me to react to a party like
srtp we do not take them seriously and
their allegations are baseless and what
they said is completely not related to
what we are speaking please
spokesperson speak Mr Eddie they're not
silent no please this is not fair let
him speak he never interrupted you
please let him speak yes we are a
spokesperson go ahead see coming to the
larger picture rahu we are talking about
Ed and the opposition leaders of this
country you spoke at at a length of
regarding money
you spoke at land the allegation made
against the Ed against Kavita and all
see you have to realize there is a
saying
when the king himself becomes a Jed jury
and executioner even the God can't help
you today the BJP which is the ruling
party of the country has become the King
which wants to become the Judge Judy and
the Executioner we want to file
fictional cases some got stories against
our leaders then you send out your troll
are we your social media your
spokespersons on television then you
also brand us you become the judge jury
and executioner the hypocrisy of the of
the BJP and the ruling Elite has become
such they have briefed such hikes is as
Rahul as we have a respective one second
round based on facts as presented by the
one minute one minute one minute as
there is today I want to also show you
the video of Mr jeevil nasmara who what
he spoke today about sujina Chaudhary
foreign
there are enough Telugu speakers in the
panelists and there are many Telugu
speakers in your in your uh in your
viewership you know what you were saying
he was directly questioning Mr sujana
Chaudhary the ill-gotten wealth he got
and today Mr jeevan nurse you can let go
of a good length Ball but this is a
Yorker you cannot let it go sure
we have established sir you will
appreciate Mr ready that I ask these
questions
but you're not answering the fundamental
question tonight and I want to come back
to you no Mr Eddie please I'm asking you
this yes please you see fine the
enforcement directorate you say is uh
you know a cage parrot it is doing the
bidding of the government fair enough I
let's go with that for a moment one
second but the charge that is being made
is not being made in isolation the Ed is
quoting Mr Buchi Babu
now can I ask you first of all what is
the relationship between Mr Buchi Babu
and K Kavita
okay you have to spare me a few minutes
here Rahul just because you asked me a
specific question yes see when the
allegation is made by an agency it is
the owners of the agencies to prove what
is the relationship how does Rao shiv
Shankar or Karthik Reddy know what is
the relation between two people now that
the Ed has said these guys are related
somehow in some business or not what not
it is for the investigation agencies to
prove rahu who are you or who are me
okay so this is this is completely see
this is what I said let's not become the
executioners here I have loved your
debate you have taken one of the most
unbiased weights in the recent times
please don't tarnish this you have to
ask the question I'll tell you a simple
fact Mr Gerald that's where Algarve
should also answer this this is the Ed
action in the last 24 hours right
Abu rated by Edie
enforcement directory or is this
enforced BJP rule directorate what is
this okay
but let me still ask you fair enough I
think we have I've asked those questions
of Mr jivial this is okay one second one
second I just want to ask you this this
is Mr Buchi Babu and I'm just going to
elaborate on the relationship in just a
few moments Mr Buchi Babu
in his statement dated 23 2 has
disclosed that there was a political
understanding between Miss K Kavita and
the CM and Deputy cm of Delhi in that
process K Kavita has also met Mr Vijay
Nair on 19th and 20th of March 2021
Vijay Naya was trying to impress Kavita
with what he could do in the policy
vijayanar was acting on behalf of the CM
I was working on the excise policy on
their behalf the understanding was that
the exchange of the favors that can be
done in the policy and the Delhi liquor
business for K Kavita some funds will be
given to the up
now this is a statement made by Mr Buchi
Babu
and siddharthalia is going to elaborate
for us viewers the exact relationship
between Buchi Babu as the Ed claims and
K Kavita now I want to ask you that
question why would she Babu implicate
himself
in this matter
by saying yes I was there this is what
happened if anything he would have said
this all lies that Kavita would have
said I don't know why is he Rahul
implicating himself see I want you I
want to take you all back to very
Infamous cases this country knows pretty
well the 2002 rights which was against
the Prime Minister himself and the
shorabudin encounter case Futures was
against Arun amitsha in those Witnesses
you will see multiple people giving out
alleged statements against the Prime
Minister and our honorable home minister
What did the what did the court finally
do see now the allegations are only
limited to what these people have said
the the the Judgment or these
allegations level which has to be
grounded the responsibilities the onus
is on the agencies or on the court
saying I want to withdraw my statement
given to the Ed one of these Gentlemens
is involved in one of those cases so I
am allergic maybe the Ed and CBI are
fabricating evidence maybe they are
scaring the weaknesses okay otherwise
why would Mr one run so much
kavita's former auditor is playing
any Innings at the best of the
enforcement director that's what you are
seeing number one Manoj Rai parno record
employee Vijay and I had acted on
behestal sesodia casual is also someone
who has been gamed devinder sharma's PA
bought mobiles that were used by sesodia
he is also of course lying uh Arun
pillai Hyderabad businessmen
alleged binami of BRS mlc Kavita also
partner indo-spirit group also gamed
witness you are saying all of these are
game people and now they are all turning
Turtle okay fair enough here's look look
at the end of the day
corruption is returned
to the mainstream of Indian party okay
wants to quickly respond yes and there
is of course the scene yes yeah very
quickly sir foreign
none of the parties the prime actors
involved have they have not said that
they there is not uh they have nothing
to do with this particular scam I have
not heard Kavita say this Miss Kavita
has not made this statement I don't know
uh these individuals that are friend on
on the panel the BRS spokesperson is
saying Kavita has not said I have
nothing to do with liquor scam there is
no one who is saying all the allegations
are absurd and there is absolutely no
hanky panky then why were phones
destroyed why were the SIM cards
destroyed is this not a fact of life is
it not a fact that Kavita met with the
deputy chief minister and and people
like Vijay and I have what was she doing
with them what was being discussed with
them what was the messages being
exchanged so I think you cannot this is
this is an opening shut case just by
making counter allegations against the
BJP you cannot get away if you have
charges against JP please do uh
politically fight them go to the courts
go to any institution where you can
establish those cases
can you not say the irct
this Railway scam did not happen there
is evidence
you said all the all of you all all of
them we are all corrupt ions
Lalu was convicted but but why are you
saving some people go ahead and help
Lalu has connected multiple times
viewers in the Ford Escape these are
convicted individuals
we have evidence a case against BJP MLA
Mr mandal Guru paksha was launched by
none other in a constitutional body
called his son was caught red-handed
with money money was found from the hand
from the house of the PJP MLA Mr uh just
said on your show where was money found
on the bed money was found on the bed
you know what happened the courts came
in and said look you cannot even discuss
this case
Channel and then the court said just
merely because
corruption and the BJP gave the same MLA
the cast of songs
welcome the BJP is misusing agencies
where the Constitutional body finds cash
in your in an mla's house they are not
suspended here
okay look one second one second I can't
get into this case because viewers the
courts have put a gag order on anyone
even discussing this now why they have
done it in their great wisdom I don't
know viewers I thought light was the
best antiseptic but the courts of course
in this country are alone unto
themselves
so they have decided that no media
should talk about this case where
allegedly money was recovered from
a very powerful individual so I don't
know why they've done it but I'm not
going to be holed up and thrown into
jail because they're seeing punawala has
decided to rake this matter up take it
up no no take it up in the Supreme Court
tell your courts how to behave whatever
you want to do sir don't do it here I'll
go to jail I just want to make it very
clear viewers but I just want to also
point out one basic fact set aside
everything else corruption is back front
and center
as one of the key issues
that is going to decide the 2024 race
viewers
and the enforcement directorate that is
copying so much criticism on being
selective
the CBI Etc
all these agencies will need to will
need to ensure that these cases reach
illogical conclusion because if they
can't there's going to be problems for
them because for the second day we're
going to have to discuss another very
important stories
very important story The priorities of
the galot government in Rajasthan are
clear day before yesterday the chief
minister shed tears rain compensation in
sarkari jobs on the families of Junaid
and Nasir they are the two suspected cow
Smugglers who were allegedly killed by
gaurakshaks while there's nothing wrong
in compensating anyone
especially under these circumstances the
question is why is this empathy
selective
while chief minister Gallo lent his
shoulder to the families of Nasir and
Junaid at 3M his police detained the
widows of Pulver Martyrs they had been
on a dharna outside Sachin pilate's
residence for the last 12 days Sachin
pilate of course
a big face in the Rajasthan government
the Congress government that demanding
an audience with the chief minister not
only did the chief minister have no time
for them they were forcibly removed from
the site times now has met the families
of the pulwama Braves they are
inconsolable the mother of Mata rohitash
lamba she broke down and cried
but the chief minister can't see her
tears in fact these individuals who have
been detained have disappeared we don't
even know where they are
viewers they've been robbed of their
dignity and I want to quickly open this
up and I want to quickly go across and
ask some very basic questions tonight
and my first question is to meghna
Girish mother of Mata major Akshay
Girish
now miss Girish thank you for speaking
to us
what do you make of this entire case
this episode The pulvama matters widows
and the way they are being treated
you know I'm
I've ever
extremely sad basically what I feel is
that a soldier never lets down his
Nation but a nation seems to somehow let
down the families of those soldiers who
gave their role defending the country
you know fighting for the country so
whatever is happening
um everybody says we stand with the next
thing we stand with the families of the
martyrs they've made a supreme sacrifice
we are there you know we will take care
but when when it actually comes to doing
what they need to they're pretty good at
forgetting what promises were made and
they're also very good at uh you know
finding some loopholes or the other to
deny the to deny the family the kind of
support that they had promised but what
do you put this down to this lack of
empathy sympathy Etc
so that you saw what was happening you
know I mean the the below the V naris
they went with a memorandum to the
governor and then they wanted to meet
the chief minister they had certain
grievances it is four years since
pulwama and if there are unfulfilled
promises and they have blue answers why
were they treated the way they were why
should the police be pushing them and
you know mishandling them they haven't
come begging for something that was not
promised to them what kind of treatment
is this that the cm's uh office you know
the lease that they need to do is they
need to uh hear them out can't they seat
them they have no space in their office
to listen to the Vietnamese
is is this the way any any citizen
should be first of all treated in that
too the wives of our matters yeah it's a
total lack of insensitivity and then you
hear them going see-sawing back and
forth almost trying to put the blame
back on the Family itself as if it is
their fault you know the the the I mean
I don't know what to say but governments
are always trying to say that they are
they're doing everything perfectly and
the fault is always of the the citizen
who's actually the sufferer
well let me bring in thank you Miss
Girish for speaking to us let me just
bring in uh Mr Madan who's a pro
Congress
uh Advocate Mr Madan now you're hearing
a martyr's mother speak this is grossly
insensitive I mean and it's also
selective
why why are you doing this these people
have served our Nations
they have sacrificed their everything
all they want is a dignity
yes yes you know I agree with you and I
will start from where you left and you
know I would you mention a work called
selective and you know I would like to
highlight that what in the context of
what is happening here I will just like
to remind you and your viewers that back
in 2019 a private bill was introduced by
the leader of opposition where a leader
of opposition wanted to have a law on
the subject where you should have a
codified law that will govern how you
will take care of the people or soldiers
Market don't throw this for one second
I'm only asking you a specific question
we can go into the law and all of that
I'm only asking a simple question you
have such a problem with that particular
person take it up why are you why are
you detaining let me bring in general
bakshi does this how does this square
with you General bakshi this is unfair
Rahul this is this is absolutely unfair
I'm making a validation
we are also no hang on is that your
point Mr Madan because they didn't do it
so you see we are also exempt from our
responsibilities no no absolutely what
is your point absolutely not I will I
will I will never for a minute what is
your point
my point is why you know the incumbent
government they are very bad they are
very bad results
the fact I will never I am not
supporting I never so then come out and
say please detain stop detaining these
people why can't you just take a
position in the interest of humanity
whole you are not letting me speak I
would have said the same thing I am not
supporting any mistreatment to any of
the you know
I am not supporting that but this is so
much Point here I mean he'll just walk
the highway
discussion time the larger Point here
don't make a larger Point make a
specific point one minute let me bring
in general
viewers by an attempt to buy up time he
knows that we are at the end of the show
so let me speak and speak and speak and
time out everybody General bakshi very
quickly I am sorry ridiculous you're
detaining you're detaining people you're
detaining children
have you know shame want talk substance
general for a minute depending what is
happening there then then if you don't
want to defend it keep quiet
General bakshi
Rahul in less than a month this is the
third incident of an outrage against the
Armed Forces personnel and their
families we had the Tamil Nadu incident
the media went ballistic you know
thereafter very shortly we had the
incident in Bihar where one of the
martyr's
father's recent memory you know the
father who was trying to install a
statue of his son quite obviously the
state government won't do it they only
do it for netas you know he was thrashed
he was put behind the bars
the chief minister of Rajasthan high and
mighty on his pedestal he refuses to
even meet absolutely excuse for it there
is no excuse I'm leaving it at this
we've run out of time but not viewers of
attention we will come back to this
story day in and day out
till these
naris get Justice I promise you this
[Music]
[Music]
I think I really can't comment on public
transportation in general but what I
would definitely want to say is that we
as a platform are trying to be as safe
for women Riders as possible in fact
very recently uh we hit the Milestone of
training more than 100 000 drivers on
the platform for gender sensitization uh
in fact as the number stands right now
we have trained more than 130 000
drivers on the platform uh especially on
gender sensitization so uh I mean we
from time to time obviously uh work on
such initiatives which are industry
first which make sure that women
experience is safe right on the platform
[Music]
foreign
more and more women drivers on the
platform in fact in the US we recently
launched a product called woman Rider
preferred wherein our woman drivers uh
will get the option to be paid only with
woman Riders and that's something which
we believe is going to be very
empowering for our women drivers to feel
safe on the platform especially if
they're taking let's say nighttime trips
Etc so uh that's something which we are
evaluating for our market and which we
would definitely want to see if uh we
can launch it here for India and yeah we
are partnering with multiple
organizations to uh get more and more
women drivers on the platform and
something which we constantly Endeavor
towards
[Music]
is not just about drivers being
sensitized towards woman Riders but it's
also about sensitizing a bit dull not as
vibrant as the perks are probably all
the top stories on the show tonight
viewers
at least six YouTube channels have been
blocked by the central government for
allegedly promoting Pro kalistan
sentiments in India
in a Crackdown against Pro Kurdistan
sympathizer amritpal Singh the cisf has
nabbed gurinder Paul Singh at the
airport he looked after amritpal's
social media
travel mounts for gurmeet Ram Rahim and
fr has now been registered in Jalandhar
he has been accused of inciting
religious sentiments
Ed conducted searches in uttar Pradesh
and Mumbai including the properties
linked to Lalu yadav and his family
members
our drivers against uh sensitizing our
drivers for all uh genders so that is
something which we will definitely work
towards and get done
[Music]
it's a very interesting idea and
something which we have ourselves
discussed and deliberated quite a lot I
think the challenge here would be to
have a service which is very reliable
because the last thing that you would
want is someone trying to book a pink
cab but then not having vehicles
available right so that's going to be a
challenge that we are going to solve uh
again it's not an easy challenge because
the number of women drivers is on the
platform really low and in general also
commercial women drivers the numbers are
fairly low so it's going to be
challenging for us to do that at this
point but what we are doing is that we
are part-time drivers
discounts or juice
so let's start the story BMW
tgl
[Music]
[Music]
IDE
foreign
from the second row of BMW 3gl Arm story
well hi there warm welcome you're
watching NewsHour at nine with me make
nadeka well in this show we are going to
tell you how unfortunately it's not new
to have tunnels by political parties
when their top bosses are faced with the
test of probity but remember when the
enforcement director at summon the
gandhis for questioning in the National
Herald case or when Mamta Banerjee and
TMC Carters laid Siege to the CBI office
in Kolkata or when Cena supporters hit
the streets over Sanjay routes arrest
but the question is is thamki of tarna
being used to deflect scrutiny well
today the day before brs's mlc Kavita
was summoned by the enforcement director
it's supposed to join in tomorrow she's
of course the daughter of Chief Minister
kcr as well she's held a dharna today at
jantan Mantra while she is going to be
quizzed about her alleged role in
influence the Delhi liquor policy she
was protesting against the center for
delaying the woman's reservation bill
now this bill of course is very very
serious it is very critical it seeks to
reserve 33 of the seats for women in Lok
Sabha and assemblies
accused the BJP of forgetting their
promises
foreign
[Music]
well the string of other opposition
leaders including the CPM General
Secretary Sita Ram Yeti have appealed to
all the parties to unite for the cause
while some others have raised questions
on the enforcement director's action on
the opposition leaders asking why
central agency's Footprints are only
present in opposition rule states
well I want to ask the CBI as well as
the Ed only one question
um is your footprint only limited to the
states where the opposition is in power
or the political leaders are in the
opposition how is it that in the 924
investigations that you have launched
and I'm talking about the Ed now
115 relate only to opposition leaders
foreign
[Music]
being implemented in Telangana first
before they target the center over it
the fight that she's taken up in Delhi
for 33 percent women reservation is not
implemented in our own state in
Telangana her own father is the chief
minister in Telangana and he this BRS
party doesn't Implement 33 reservation
in Telangana itself in 2014 kcr Mr kcr
gave only six seats to women in out of
119 constituencies
in 2018 he gave four seats to women out
of 119 constituencies even to this day
there are not more than two or three
ministers women ministers or women MPS
or women mlcs and then what right have
you got to fight for this cause in Delhi
why has Miss Kavita taken this cause at
this moment and not earlier why hasn't
this party implemented this cause while
they could in Telangana the only reason
is they are using this 33 percent
women's reservation as a diversion
tactic they are using this to save her
skin tomorrow because tomorrow day after
her arrest is imminent in the Delhi
liquor scam there they have resorted to
this farce is what I believe
well of course this isn't the first time
that political parties have hit the
streets in protest when they face the
heat of investigative agencies let's
show let's remind you how tarna and
protests have been staged in face of
paint Charters let's look at the
national Herald case in June 2022
enforcement directorate had quizzed the
Gandhi Sonia and Rahul the follow-up
three days of Nationwide protests which
were held by the congress party in
guwahati you had Congress Carter's even
attack an ACP level police officer in
the Narada sting case of 2021 CBI had
arrested two of the TMC mantries and one
MLA The Fallout the chief minister Mamta
Banerjee and her supporters tried to
storm the CBI office there were Stone
pelting also which happened the chief
minister sat outside demanding release
of her nathas in the Patra chol
pre-development case in August 2022
enforcement directorate had arrested
Cena's Sanjay Rao now Cena workers the
other faction raised slogans they
blocked roads the women's wing also
attempted to Stage Rasta Roku so here's
why Rivals are calling out brss fight
for women's reservation in Parliament a
complete sham well data has shown that
while BRS has ostensibly supported the
women's reservation bill they even held
at her nine its uh favor today but they
have given a raw deal to women when it
came to Distributing tickets for state
and Lok Sabha polls sample this on your
screens you can see this data there
speaking for itself Telangana has 119
seats but BRS had fielded only four
women candidates in 2018 assembly polls
and six in the 2014 state polls talking
about Lok Sabha the party field at two
only two women candidates in 2019 and
just one in the 2014 polls of Lok Sabha
so here's the legitimate question here
on newsr at night
is it to deflect scrutiny
[Music]
you're watching the NewsHour at night
debate number one on times now super
prime time
let me grow crossword pandas joining us
today Mr RP Singh spokesperson with the
BJP doctor Anand ranganathan is joining
us and author kailash adhikari is
joining us MD of governance now Ravi
srivastava a political analyst here on
our show ravola sridhar Reddy is joining
us spokesperson with the BRS lokesh
Jindal of the Congress parties here with
us as well Mr ready I am going to come
to you first I'm going to start by
uploading the efforts that your party
has had to try and push for the women's
reservation Bill
representation of women in positions of
power is extremely important for a
democracy to ensure that there is
equality it is a very important issue
however it should not be politicized
this is one of the issues incidentally
the draft has been on the back burner
since 2008. is it mere coincidence that
the day before your Chief's daughter is
summoned by the enforcement directorate
in the liquor gate probe that this voice
for women equality women's Liberation
and the women's quota bill is now coming
up today
who kept it in the back burner Modi
promised in 2014
again they have uh promised in 2019 and
they have not implemented the human
reservation so who has kept it in the
back burner Congress you know misled
this country first they have promised
they did something of course but they
could not be successful in making it
happen now modisi promised twice and you
know they have not done it so what is
left for us as a political party we
support women reservation Bill we want
this is my question my question was
about the timing of the dhana
it is nothing to do with the Ed
questioning or these cases basically we
have been you know fighting for this for
a long time in our state in local bodies
we have implemented 50 reservation to
women so we wanted this to happen at the
national level the women reservation
bill so we are fighting for it when it
comes to the Lok Sabha polls how many
women candidates the the BRS feel when
it came to your state polls
see we in in our state I already have
told you in the local bodies that no I
asked you a different question
we have two ministers in our cabinet
there are you know mlas there are
Corporation chairmans there you know as
you said local bodies 50 so we have
Mayors Municipal chairmans you know at
every level we have a proper
representation of women in every elected
and even nominated positions so
Telangana state today has done enough
you know on the women empowerment issue
now we want Narendra modi's government
to keep their promise and what they have
promised to this country we are not
asking would you like to come in it is
something that BRS claims it has always
stood for and there is no such suspect
timing when it comes to the Dharma one
day ahead of the Ed summons for
keikavata
well our
other promises to ensure that we clean
up the country from the corrupt
political people or political bosses
the Bears spokesperson should speak
about but but
before talking about anyone else
and then let them explain what is the
relationship of Kavita ma'am with these
two gentlemen and did Kavita Madam took
a chartered plane to Delhi for a meeting
at a prime Maiden with Vijay Nair or not
and why did she destroyed her SIM cards
and her voice that's a bigger question
what is this and then as per woman
reservation let me quote you another
figure
this 17 increase in women atrocities in
their state is almost twenty thousand
plus women who are suffering who has
suffered atrocities in Telangana last
year I mean they shared a little much
more
so that's the state of the affair as a
woman reservation but the bigger issue
today is the chair tend to deflect they
are trying to take this other sealer
cover from the what's going to happen
tomorrow and and since she is the she is
going to be confronted with the uh all
the key accused in this uh this case
that's why this cover-up has happened
tomorrow she will say that oh I'm being
victimized I'm to play play a victim
card they will doing this that I was
trying to pick up women issue and that's
why I've been victimized by the Ed and
I've been arrested I don't know whether
they'll arrest him arrested or not but
if they do then oh I have been arrested
by IDI for doing uh taking over the
woman cause
is that what's happening lokesh Jindal
because the congress party has also said
yes it's great however an invitation was
extended to your party as well is this
playing as per the toolkit if May one
may call it of the opposition dharnas
that we have seen across that first you
hold a protest if anything happens then
later on you always have the caveat that
you can add that you are being targeted
because you are part of the opposition
party and it's not about probity at all
you should be let out of any kind of
lens or any kind of scanner being put or
any kind of property test being put for
any of your leaders we've seen another
time of your gandhis as well
hi beginner in fact the entire nation
knows that right from the independence
it has been Congress that has stood for
women's right whether it was in the form
of Hindu Marriage Act whether it was
1993 Constitutional Amendment act
whether it was the Indian succession act
in 2005 and it was only Congress which
brought about these changes after 1993
2010 also it was passed by rajya Sabha
now all other political parties now they
are trying to reach out to Congress
because they are they are themselves
corrupt they have indulged into corrupt
activities they have at one point of
time they were counting mlas to Congress
that okay out of 500 600 these many mlas
that they have as small regional
political parties and now they want to
have some form of a helping hand from
the Congress the point is if you are
corrupt if you have indulged into such
scams Congress is not going to come to
your support
to try and deflect attention from
arrests and questionings and probes and
interrogations
ah Magna you cannot compare the national
Herald case with what is happening now
that's entirely different it is you
cannot compare apples and oranges in in
the National Herald case it was the CBI
and Ed's high-handedness and atrocities
but right now what is happening is
entirely different
I mean
it happens to others that you may not be
alive right now then it's probably there
are a group of political parties which
have indulged into tampering of proofs
they have they indulged into tampering
of evidences and all such forms but was
that there in National Herald case no a
National Heritage I can see you look
very amused apparently that was all a
Witch Hunt when it came to the National
Herald case perhaps you should remind uh
Jindal for some of the facts of the case
a good evening meghna I don't know it's
one of those days
are rotten
sir please if both of them happened in
the same Hotel is what Mr RP Singh Is
reminding our viewers Dr ranganathan
come in
yes no as I was saying it's one of those
days where there is absolute hypocrisy
overload you know you and I request you
to tell me whose hypocrisy should I
expose first there is the BRS it's
hypocrisy there is the BJP is hypocrisy
there is the congress's hypocrisy and
last uh please don't trash me there is
your hypocrisy as well if you don't mind
myself right so so please let me know
which has been lying on the back burner
since 2008 it really hasn't seen the
light and it doesn't seem anytime soon
despite the dharnas it's likely to see a
light because different things on camera
and different things happen inside the
parliament as we all have seen
will cool absolutely let me start with
BRS because they are the ones who are
who are holding this almost rally
protest rally call it what you may and
you know the facts of its previous two
elections that it fought the women
contested this the tickets that were
given were six percent and seven percent
the women's reservation Bill demands 33
reservation for women so please Practice
What You Preach Mr ready as far as BJP
is concerned Mr Singh should realize
that they these women reservation bill
has been a poll promise Manifesto
promise not just a poll Promise by in
2014 by the BJP 2009 by the BJP Mishra
advani and 2019 it is in their Manifesto
yes
as far as Congress is concerned with the
hypocrisy
you know Congress is saying that Rahul
something on one hand says that India is
not a nation but a union of States so by
Union of States
reservation and as for congress working
since Independence about women's rights
and lastly please don't curse me when
you say when you applauded the BRS for
standing up for women's reservation I
just want to ask you is there a women's
reservation amongst the anchors in times
now
each and every successive party
successive government has shown the same
apathy towards a women reservation bill
is it today simply being exploited to
meet other political ends and agenda
first of all Anand is almost an
investigator and he has found out that
everybody is a hypocrite and uh there
are no issues as such but they are just
trying to Pro beat the other one because
the fact is that I want to I mean I I I
can't comprehend that by making a dharna
today how the Kavita is trying to evade
the questioning tomorrow I mean
ultimately the fir has been filed the
agency as the Monday summoned our agency
at somebody also agency has demanded
system also agency Maryland uh Kavita
also no what is what is a big deal about
it why should it be called somebody is
trying to threaten like Congress did a
dharna for three days but did the CBI or
the Ed stock no did it interrogate they
took that elderly lady
some 75 PS plus year old for the
questioning in the office
yeah I'm sorry to interrupt I don't like
to interrupt but sorry to interrupt you
just to interject here the CBI as you
know very well in the Rouse Avenue Court
had said that by constant dharnas at the
time in the in the context of ahmadmi
party and the recorders the constant
dhanas which were being held is
intimidating the eyewitnesses it is a
show of strength and of political
strength by a party which intimidates
eyewitnesses at times it can influence
them as well and hence impact the probe
that's what the CBI has said
have any kind of impact no no I can I
can
I can also constantly doing the dharna
and making the you know cartoons for the
app and all that are they trying to help
the CPI and TD for that matter which are
their agencies because the agencies are
behaving like a security guard Watchman
or a helper for the BJP so are they
trying to take their strength their
hands by making a Dharma in Delhi why
are they doing it
nobody is interfering with the process
of the law let it carry on let it do it
they are doing everything now seven days
I'd like to take that point across to
you is it usually a calculated what for
example a woman's reservation bill it
was not even in the right every party
very conveniently doesn't practice it in
their own State regardless of the scope
that they could have within the powers
that they have within their own state
for example the BRS but today one day
ahead of the Ed you suddenly have the
bahana of women's reservation Bill uh
now there is a protest at dharna which
has happened one day
is happening all of that has happened
incidentally just one day ahead of Ed
probing the BRS iron
absolutely you know what has happened uh
these days is that over the past two
years you can see a lot of opposition
leaders it has become a fashion for them
to just spew their anger on the
government and the bhartiya janta party
or our investigative agencies if they
are under any proboard scanner and now
what has been done by Miss Kavita is
that she has taken that entire fashion
to the street you know by doing this
dharna now the woman's reservation bill
is just I would call as a shagufa she's
just using it as as a means to deflect
from the real issue now today when uh
the enforcement director was in the Rose
Avenue Court asking for the custody of
uh Manisha it very you know pertinently
pointed out certain issues that how the
entire conspiracy was done however Mr
Aurora was involved how Mr Met uh uh the
entire corporate structure of the
company held by uh uh one Mr Aurora how
certain Kickbacks were received at then
and how the entire South company uh you
know corroborated and were there the
part of that foreign
thank you migna thank you so you know uh
the enforcement directors as well as the
CBI has kindly pointed out that why do
they need the custody I mean our
investigative agencies they are very
they run by competent people they're
competent agencies and they don't have
the time to just go behind anyone I mean
if there is a predicate offense in the
case of an enforcement director there is
a chart sheet and there's an FR filed by
the Ed so why would they be influenced
even the conversation
then why why would you be scared over
there now let the learner happen if it
is independent
sorry that question is to me
foreign
let me take one of the questions that Mr
adhikari had pointed out and it's
important that we have your views one of
the charges what the Ed is going to be
looking into and the allegations against
her is that she had controlled the South
cattle and 30 percent of the delhi's
liquor Market as per the central
agencies also that she is part of the
group which had allegedly paid 100 crore
rupees Kickbacks to some of the topmost
party leaders officials and other people
in the entire liquor gate policy while
it was being drafted allegedly she also
bought 32.5 percent stake in Indo
spirits and this via some of her proxies
these are very serious charges and Mr
ready if you really feel that there's
nothing wrong in what in the conduct of
your mlc Kavita then why not welcome the
probe why go around on cameras calling
it Witch Hunt if you have nothing to
hide then let the broke continue
see we already have told you and told
many times these are all false
allegations it's a fabricated case they
are trying to implicate our leaders in
these cases till now in Telangana this
is the election year the Ed and it has
rated more than 13 ministers and mlas
MPS together and kardashi is the 14th
one so we know BJP will be hunting our
leaders bjb will be sending EBA Ed CBI
after our leaders because this election
year and this will go on but the problem
this is
we we never said don't come we have
answered CBA in the past again she is
appearing before ed tomorrow we never
went to court asking for a stay like BJP
leaders there were four people on the
basis of BJP tabra has come to tell
Hyderabad to bribe and purchase our mlas
after power police booked them BJP
fought for them took the case to CBI so
the charges against BJP are true Target
against BRS are false absolutely
absolutely the cases are false before
you know going to the next thing and Mr
ranganathan was questioning me how many
people have contested what is the
representation of women in your state
let me give you some stats give me 30
seconds
yeah 13 Municipal corporations eight
women eight are Mayors women Mayors we
have 125 Municipal you know
municipalities out of its 72 Municipal
chairman are women we have 661
corporators 351 or women we have 2849
councilors 15520 women we have 32 Jilla
chairmans out of which 20 are women out
of five
[Music]
let me know if I'm wrong you must
correct me if I'm wrong but as per the
statistics in 2018 Telangana assembly
polls out of the 119 only four women
candidates were fielded which is about
3.3 percent
it is
2014 only five percent were women
candidates fielded by your party am I
right or am I wrong also in Lok Sabha
polls 2019 there were two women who were
fielded by our party
foreign
[Music]
because that is again
the variables want to fight for so
please let me show some kind of curtsy
to the others Dr ranganathan finish your
point first of all thank you and just to
I have not completed my statement
Please Mr Eddie you've given us a lot of
facts I lived a lot of stats now listen
to the other panelists as well I'll come
back to you
next time please go
for the next time just a suggestion
there are six panelists you should have
17 time reserved for each one of us
yes go ahead no just two points you see
I've made uh because I come prepared
with data I talked about the previous
two you can replay what I said previous
two Telangana elections and you
corroborated that data I said far from
33 reservation Telangana I had seven to
nine percent in fact you even less five
five percent reservation for women and
Mr Reddy talked about every other
counselor Zilla parisha panchayat but he
missed out two data points and those two
data points were for MLA assembly
elections so he is being selective
nonetheless I do applaud I do applaud Mr
ready when he talks about the panchayat
and the counselors it is worthy but the
fact remains what I said is correct now
number two there this is nobody's Grouse
that the BJP control
yesterday also I said that 95 percent of
the people investigated are opposition
leaders it is true Mr Reddy is also
alleged that true what I want to ask is
that there is a Telangana vigilance
commission how I want to ask Mr Eddie as
is so good at statistics I want to ask
him how many BJP politicians has the
Telangana vigilance commission probe in
the last seven years name tell me how
many do you see the number Mr ready give
me the number we have nothing wrong
whether it is Telangana vigilance
commission so they are not corrupt
I wanted to tell you only one thing
through the whatever probe agencies of
the state we have never gone beyond you
know behind everybody
can you give names and says these are
the names can you give him names give me
the numbers how many PJP you said
everyone is corrupt so I'm asking you
for numbers how many BJP leaders has the
Telangana vigilance commission
one thing is
I will tell you only one thing
we allow the ACB we allow the vigilance
commission to function independently
without any political questions
about the EDM the CBI also so that one
is really good but let me take that
point across to MRP Singh because these
are charges again and again that your
party faces that Ed is caged and so is
the CBI why is it the enforcement
directorate which wants to summon K
Kavita tomorrow has a conviction rate of
less than 0.5 percent is it true that
ahead of killing on a polls BJP likes to
lock up as a ledge look up its political
opponents at the end of it nothing comes
out of it so they are let go you're not
ready to listen you know in a MLA
bribery case just three months back we
have booked four culprits or ACB book
and BJP lawyers have automated on their
behalf in the court they tried for bail
and bjp's National secretary Mr BL
Santosh was also you know booked in the
case okay
slightly higher than 0.4 but less than
0.5 percent tomorrow it has
Mr Reddy's got 33 percent time
well it was Zero
well it was zero percent during up
regime and don't go by percentage I mean
address
can I can I complete can I complete okay
okay
please complete you are saying that up
also did it Commerce also did it
extension of
Congress thank you and it's not
yes Mr RPC Mr srivastava please go ahead
whatever you have to say please complete
because he will keep interrupting isn't
bad happening no no he'll not do that
he'll not do that Mr RPC please complete
let me let me me quote you and then let
me give me some time this uh in European
regime there are five cases against
Congress by the by the 80 three to
against the BJP seven against TMT two
again bsp one against bjd one against
Case uh uh YSR four against gmk in India
game there are six cases against BJP 24
is BJP TMC 19. so it's not that it's
only uh only for opposition parties I
mean whoever is under under scanner will
be will be taken care or will be
investigated okay and also uh Mr Eddie
was talking about some data about uh the
reservation give me a second reservation
in the state that is mandatory it's not
it's not as per their will it's not that
their party is initiative it's just
mandatory as per law yes
you've not done us any favors by having
that minimum amount of representation
but serious charges let me go across to
Mr location
today the congress party talks about how
easy and cbi's inflow influenced by the
center you have Mr RP Singh quoting how
is the Congress different
who was charged of corruption suddenly
when he comes to BJP he becomes the
chief minister now these are not corrupt
anymore
the point is if you really want to
strengthen the credibility of CBI for a
ordinary person for Ahmad me at least at
least don't be shamelessly using it or
not using it for people who were
previously charged with corruption
he was one of the person accused in the
sarada's camp but the moment he comes to
BJP he is he's got free now the point is
when the party members are protesting
they are I need to answer that against
his selectivity this manner of
functioning and this arm twisting that
BJP indulges into to gain some brownie
points
otherwise it is
question did
movement is on Power and who's on the
receiving end of it and that's the
biggest problem for people like us who
go out and vote and we are not sure who
is going to be better than the other
foreign
is a pillar of our democracy and it is
independent you can definitely approach
the courts I mean what's wrong in that
you cannot
on the streets that there is a vision
behind me there's a vision behind me
there's a Judiciary you are a citizen of
this country you are free
but they are exactly the same they all
seem to be running along the same
parallel lines you'll have your dharna
You'll Play of which uh your victim card
and at the end of it all we get is a lot
of politics very little convictions
coming out of it
exactly that is the point because the
BJP does not want to convey they only
want to make a show of it they just want
to show the days people are as corrupt
as we are they are not different
they are doing exactly the same thing
what we have been doing for the last
nine years exactly the same corruption
they are doing so this is what they want
to show to everybody that's all that's
all but although they have been beaten
severely in Delhi and Punjab and other
places but still they have not learned
their lesson and they still want to try
with this
over the women's reservation when none
of these political parties have showed
the gumption to come out and push for it
if not push for it even in their limited
Scopes within their own states to
implement it if you all really had the
conviction it would have been
implemented it is still lying in the
back burner unfortunately being used
today for political mileage we're
running out of time so thank you so much
all the gentlemen for joining us here on
the show hopefully this dharna dhamki to
deflect scrutiny is something that we
can all avoid that's one of the stories
we are going to be looking out for here
uh news hour at nine but here's the next
big story well after a sort of strike
and the BBC Blitz now comes the NIT
attack repeatedly India is being bashed
on its democracy maligned by the
non-state actors and agenda driven
foreign ego system but why and to what
end well this time once again it is the
New York Times an opinion piece written
by an Rada Basin of the Kashmir times
has sparked this controversy in her
op-ed she says that the repressive media
policies are destroying kashmiri
journalism and media Outlets are being
intimidated into serving as Government
mouthpiece she also says that the
government is creating information
vacuum in the region of Kashmir of 13
million inhabitants and Kashmir may not
survive Prime Minister Modi the op-ed
also alleges that digital media
Amendments have been made to block
content that the Modi government does
not like that these are just some of the
claims being made against the Indian
government however the opposition has
wholeheartedly endorsed this propaganda
as it has been called out by the BJP
hailing it as the absolute truth
if a line or two or a paragraph
something get
published in any newspaper media and
they say that uh
and if the the things go against them
then they say that it's a propaganda
is such a contradiction now when the
truth is being covered with them because
they are not in they don't accept the
truth what they accept is that one side
that there should be praise and praise
and uh
no negative side or real size should be
shown yeah
but is the nyt trying to paint fiction
as facts let's put out some of the data
it has hailed the separatists leader
Sayed Alisha gilani as one of the
Towering figures of separatism what it
does not say is that NC had accused the
gilani of being on isi's payroll in fact
he was charged with sedition in 2010 a
case of FEMA violation was also
registered against him in 2019. this
article also equates the BBC survey to
suppression of facts what it does not
say is that the income tax department
saucers had said that the BBC was
non-compliant with its rules of India
also there is non-compliance in the
transfer pricing rules and deliberate
diversion of amounts for profit was the
allegation on it it also says that
thousands of innocent homes were
bulldozed and they were left homeless
however what it does not say is that one
of the homes belong to ashik negro for
example his home 2 was demolished negro
was an accused on the Pulver attack Hans
house was also raised kulam Navi was
designated a terrorist under uapa these
important parts are also not pointed out
in this article but let's remind you of
nyt's rather checkered past as well
should it be the goal post when it comes
to what truth is remember nyt was called
out for its political bias for not
adequately reporting on allegations of
corruption against Joe Biden's son
Hunter Biden and Whitey gave an open
platform to assafali zadari in 2008 the
then president of Pakistan to distance
his government from the 2611 attacks nyt
gave an open platform to Imran Khan to
attack India's abrogation of article 317
Jammu and Kashmir something which was
completely an internal matter nyd had
described Jammu and Kashmir as living
hell of anger and fear in August 2019.
nyd had claimed in May 2021 that India's
coveted death toll is the worst in the
world and could be more than 10 times
What was a officially deported nyd was
also forced to apologize for its cartoon
monking the Mongolian in October 2014.
but let's also remind you of the
antecedents of the author of this
article and rather scene well she is a
frequent attendee of isi sponsored
events as per some of the agencies also
she has openly backed isi operations led
by gulab nabifa he's of course one of
the convicts and firmly absolved Phi in
the receiving funds from isi invited to
a event where 5 was also presented as
one of the speakers he of course is the
daughter of vedasino is a stunt
supporter and known supporter of isi
operations in Kashmir Phi even had
written a piece on Ved bhasin after his
death in that orbit he had glorified
Basin made bhasin remember had also
attended isi-funded events all of this
is part of the facts
you're watching the NewsHour at nine and
debate number two on times now super
Prime Time
joining us today on the show Dr Anand
ranganathan
is also joining us a political land list
my first question is going to be for you
we have seen after Soros there's been
Hindenburg there has been Washington
Post articles now there is New York
Times yet again is this a concerted
strike of non-state actors
actively maligning India and its
democracy when they are far removed from
it
firstly what you forgot to tell were the
viewers about the New York Times is that
on Gandhi jayanti in 2019 there was an
article
India and the Bugatti and that
attacked by none other than
but you didn't tell them because that
day in Europe times was supposed to be a
good paper the other day is supposed to
be the bad paper and I'll seek a reply
to this from Dr ranganathan but second
Point yes verily there's ruthless
corruption in Jammu and Kashmir
Administration modiji's funds are being
rooted but the newspaper whichever
writes against corruption is denied
government advertisements and any reason
who speaks against that corruption which
is
because maybe she is also a victim that
she is not getting her share of
advertisements the government
advertisements because government
advertisement has become a new
conspiracy against the Modi government
that the one who writes against
corruption is denied government
advertisement the general speaks against
corruption is highest so it is something
for Modi ji to check what is wrong with
jnk Administration it's not me to blame
anybody but yes one important point when
you talk about New York Times
victim you use the word victim let me go
across the sushil pundit also who's
joining us uh he's an activist so she'll
pundit because
you two are a representative of
kashmirandi who decides who is the true
representative who is the fake
representative do you share the views of
Anuradha was seen by simple questions
I'm far from it Anuradha machine is the
daughter of a father with Basin and as
they say the fruit doesn't fall far from
the tree gulab Nabi Phi wrote a fawning
obituary when Wade Basin died
was arrested by United States of America
for spying in U.S on behalf of isi and
he served time there he is the one who
organized conference circuits junkets
for Indian journalists retired
bureaucrats and busy buddies in ngos to
come and conference on jnk on Kashmir on
occupation of India in Kashmir on human
rights violations in Kashmir in the Garb
of representing people
this is who Anuradha bhasin is show me
one article she has written all her life
about the genocide of Hindus in Kashmir
Valley show me one article about human
rights violations of kashmiri Muslims
within Kashmir at the hands of jihadis
she is and has always been a hurry up
representative in media debates she has
always represented she is a separatist
point of view
even when
she has never let us feel the absence of
guriath in media debates
she has always represented a separatist
point of view
and this is a continuation of the Legacy
she represents in the newspaper and her
own father
that Legacy continues and one of the
things and I must point this out to Dr
Anand ranganathan also I'll come back to
you uh one of the things that she had
said that her own newspaper office was
stormed then they locked it up again one
of the selective things which was not
pointed out in this article was that
building was sealed in question was
allotted to Wade bhasin her father by
the government her father in 1994 then
the government reserves the right to
take it back after the death of the
allotti that is what had happened do you
think that you can look at Anuradha
Basin as a neutral Observer and unbiased
journalist reporting the facts on the
ground as nyt would have us belief
maybe not she is as much a neutral
Observer as Pakistani empires of the
1980s look where else would a
propagandist write but in a pamphlet
produced by a propaganda Factory called
the nyt
I wouldn't even honestly wrap my
kachoris in New York Times for fear of
all that toxicity bleeding on to them to
paraphrase Kennedy ask not how these
journalists became frauds Mega ask how
these frauds became journalists the New
York Times as well as the Kashmir times
are methane's viewing landfills of Lies
fraud selectivity employing the drags of
the society unemployables Urban naxal
academics nepo Dynasty doormats and isi
Stooges these are the same journalists
who hailed as you said says a hero let
me quote Kilani their hero number one
this is what he said verbatim India is a
bigger enemy of Islam and Muslims than
even Israel two Muslims are a calm
wholly separate from the Hindus the
basis of the unit is Islam and Islam
alone three accession to India would
result in the kashmiri Muslims having to
live perpetually under Hindu slavery
four Kashmir must become an Islamic
State unquote these are the same
journalist meghna and their children who
were silent when refugees one of the two
lakh West Pakistan refugees who ran for
their life and settle in Kashmir when
melu ramai's children were barred from
local jobs and Welfare schemes
again her family was brought to Kashmir
to work as sweepers in 1957. radhika
cleared the BFS entrance exam but
radhika could only get a job as a
sweeper because she wasn't a domicile
when for 70 years the human rights of
lacks of the legs gurkhas women seeks
refugees were brutally trampled upon by
the state and his politicians like
Farooq Abdullah delighted in saying and
I quote him they want to abolish 370 and
will remain silent inshallah we will
fight we dare them Allah would want that
we gain independence from India unquote
these are the same Journal religious 30
seconds who were silent when they three
years ago Supreme Court diabolically
rejected reopening cases of criminal
arrested against kashmiri Hindu because
God too much time had elapsed and these
same journalists are silently seizing
now because while three years to 2019
3686 law in order incidents three years
since 2019 the number is only 430 Terror
attacks have reduced by 40 percent in
2018. sorry Mega just 10 seconds but
there is one thing one has learned over
the years it is that you cannot cure
these propagandists they are like the
rat Beach they're every drop of blood
spawns more on the same final 10 seconds
there are three parallels you have right
now I posed one question I will answer
sushil will answer I want my good friend
answer I will Sayed shakilani was a
terrorist asked this question whether he
was a terrorist and then asked magic
this question
being put to you
democracy right foreign
what I know is that there are newspapers
in Jammu which are Modi box which says
but they are denied advertisements
because they write against Corruptions
you want me to repeat the same question
should I keep repeating the same
question I'll ask you a second question
I'll ask you a separate question you
clearly don't want to answer that I'll
ask you a different question I'll change
the question you're not giving me an
answer machine you say that she's Fair
impartial she's talking about the
kashmiris how much of investigative work
has she done about the Hindu genocide
which has happened in Kashmir tell us
about listers the mha has
what has she done for the Hindus who I
think all of us have accepted have they
victimized their face one of the longest
programs in the world what is the
investigative word which has been done
what is the fight for justice foreign
there are so many choices
you have written more than you can chew

along with the yellow
or complimenting frames
good evening and welcome you are
watching the news art agenda I'm Padma
Joshi today was sent to seven days of Ed
custody this after the agency said in
court that it needed to question him
further and even confront him with other
persons connected to the liquor policy
case in addition to that the agency also
said that it needs to follow the money
Trail and Trace the proceeds of crime
which add up to at least
292 crore rupees through all of this the
ahmadmi party continued to eulogize
Manisha sodia comparing him to everyone
from Maharana Pratap to Shaheed bhagat
Singh to Lord Rama himself but all of
that was to not much avail because in
its order that came late today evening
the Rouse Avenue Court has actually
Justified the arrest of the former Delhi
deputy chief minister in its order
here's what the court said it's said
that there is nothing to suggest that
the accused arrest that is the arrest of
manise is in violation of the pmla or
legal in any fashion the court also says
that it is prima fasci convinced that
the accused arrest is Justified because
power to seek remand is essentially a
part of the Ed's power to conduct
investigation since the enforcement
directorate has submitted that the
accused has been totally evasive and
non-cooperative during interrogation
hence the court has granted them seven
days custody of Mr cesodia for further
interrogation in light of all this can
the ahmadni party still say that the
arrest of Mr sesodia is vendetta and
agenda driven if the eulogizing of Mr
sasodia as Lord Ram an effort to try and
now defy him and sidestep the facts of
the case and given the Court's judgment
today
should we then presume that the Ed has
actually managed to put together a
convincing enough case against the
former Delhi Deputy cm
you're watching the NewsHour active
debate number one is on times now super
prime time
all right joining us on the debate Sanju
Verma National spokesperson of the BJP
namit saxena Advocate on record in the
Supreme Court political analyst Sanjeev
kaushik will be joining us in just a bit
Krishan spokesperson of the BRS is
joining us Vivek shivastava political
analyst do you want to ask the first
question and actually let me quote to
you from what the Rouse Avenue Court has
said
Point number 16 where the court says in
view of the background given by the
enforcement directorate the court is
prima sasai convinced that the arrest of
the accused in this case is Justified
and the Ed has powers to seek custody of
the accused for his further examination
and interrogation what happens now to
the argument that this is vendetta here
is a quote saying that the arrest is
Justified
okay uh see uh I'm not trying to support
Manisha sodium neither do I support
corruption however I would like to speak
very generally number one the government
and the investigate gating agencies are
very very selective that is my first
charge when it is Narda Sharda when it
is their own people Sir with the
greatest surprise
we have been going on and on over the
last several years talking about General
generalities yes I am not talking about
investigating agencies of the BJP I am
quoting to you simply from a court order
right for your benefit I will quote
further from this order which also says
it has been specifically submitted in
the EDF application that custodial
interrogation of the accused is a must
since during the course of his
examination he has been totally evasive
and non-cooperative and he did not
disclose the true facts and rather came
up with answers that have been found
entirely in contrast and contradiction
to oral and documentary evidence
collected so far this is what the court
is saying in its order so please let's
let's talk about specifics of what the
course has I read it I read it
Absolutely I'll be specific I'll be
specific I read it please try to
understand one thing padmaja in our
country the court responds to what
information it is fed by the
investigating agencies please try to
understand and uh again you will say I'm
going into generals but whether it was
the Jamia case or it was the jnu case or
it was the Delhi riots case whatever
were the chart sheets that were filed
many of them were later on caused by the
government and many people were let go
who were not guilty that's the first
part and we all know about it now in
this particular case also it's an
economic crime that is the first part it
is I mean it all comes under the proof
of financial fraud as the BJP and the
Rival parties are trying to call
actually it's money laundering because
pmla has been applied please start to
understand yes money laundering sir pmla
no no I'm I'm not saying that but all
I'm trying to tell yeah yeah in money
laundering in a financial fraud case I
mean the money Trail is very clear it is
very visible it does not need days and
days and days of Raman the first remand
was going to be over foreign
you have confronted him you have
questioned him but not one PESA has been
recovered where is the money Trail and
in order to avoid answering this
question the Ed has conveniently named
Vijay Nair as a representative of Mani
sasodia where is the money
see for the offense of money laundering
you know getting the trail of money
takes some time see these are
intelligent crimes where you know money
will order money and there are three
stages in money laundering you know and
two stages are layering and integration
so the investigating agency is bound to
unfold the layers which are there you
know and extraordinary circumstances
require Extraordinary Measures that is
why I say that custody of this
particular gentle with this particular
accuse is necessary that was the quote
has also sounded because in such a case
where you to unfold the layers and to to
reach a conclusion that where money was
integrated in what particular hands
money was collected and how money was
floated you know it is required that you
unfold these days and that is where
would also say that custodial
interrogation is required because he's
evasive you know because he see we have
to understand this see these are very
intelligent crimes and they when they
are evidences when their allocations of
destroying the evidence to you know uh
take out the money Trail take out you
know by phones Etc you know removing the
trail as to what has actually happened
so there it is
going to do now start beating him up no
actually they have laid out what they
are going to do they have got officers
former officers excise officers who are
going to be confronted with Mr sisodia
there is a possibility that he is going
to be confronted with Mrs he is going to
be confronted with other people who are
also currently under arrest and just by
the way since you are talking about him
being beaten up do you know that the
court in its order has said that he is
going to be questioned one under CCTV
surveillance two every day he is going
to talk for 15 minutes to his Council
three he is going to be allowed to meet
his family so for anyone he thinks that
he is going to be beaten he can confide
in his counsel and his family and his
questioning will take place under the
Gaze of a CCTV camera Mr srivastava
it's an harassment technique all I can
see is it is just harassment it's a
financial trail that you know
investigating agency needs to come out
with you can keep on you know make the
man under a man for the next 30 days and
if you feel if you're saying that he's
evasive he will still be with
this is perfectly Justified for the time
being but who's to know who's to know
Sanju Verma that tomorrow this may not
fall by then Mr sisodia will have
already been in jail for close to a
month he spent His Holy Angel he will
stay almost a month in jail
and I just have this to say because I
think the lawyer on your panel uh has
put forth the illegal angle to this
entire uh uh issue I
I which I want to uh put swap to your
audience
everybody who says that you know Manisha
sodia is being victimized and there is
witch hunting and Vendetta and crying
wolf BJP is misusing Central agencies I
want them to know that there was a
historic Judgment of course uh you know
that judgment has been uh petitioned
against but on the 27th of July 2022 the
Supreme Court said two very important
things while giving a judgment and
dismissing 241 petitions uh from leaders
across the Spectrum who said that the
piano should be disbanded a it said that
under the pmla ACT section 24 there is
the reverse burden of proof normally in
any case you are innocent till proven
guilty but when the pmla case comes in
in case of an accused you are guilty
till proven innocent so under section 24
of the tmna act of 2002
has to prove he is
Act of 2002 which says that when an
accused is arrested by the authorities
he or she immediately becomes subject to
an offense which is progressable and
non-bailable these are two very
important Provisions so for you to sit
here and lecture the BJP saying Ed and
CBI are being uh you know misused I'm
going to ask just one very simple
question to Vivek srivastava I won't be
very verbose Prime Minister Modi was
hounded for 20 long years for the
Gujarat rights case he was given a clean
check first by the session spot in
Gujarat then by the magistrates Court
America
he was given a clean sheet by the
Supreme Court in three different
occasions and still people continue to
Hound him till this day this is
absolutely 25th of June 2022 the Supreme
Court case is saying there was no
criminal conspiracy do you still not
have him do you not still have damage
okay quickly response then I want to
bring it
Sanju Varma the nature the nature of
crimes was very different there was a
program
which could have been state-sponsored
and that is
and this is a difference
there are different things
let me bring in Mr kaushik Mr kaushik
under the pmla the burden of proof is on
the accused and in the present case at
least so far the court hasn't found that
Mr sisodia has been able to prove
himself innocent Point number one point
number two there are six factors listed
in the Court's order which has convinced
the court enough to say
investigation or interrogation
let me list out those points to you one
specific evidence has come on record
during investigation that shows the
accused got Incorporated certain
material Clauses in excise policy which
weren't even discussed in the Gom
meeting group of ministers
Clauses were allegedly inserted by him
for benefit of South liquor Lobby
specifically alleged that also found
disclosed by approver that huge amount
of advanced Kickbacks of 100 crores paid
by South Lobby out of the total amount
and amount of around 20 to 30 crores was
transferred through co-accused Abhishek
it has been revealed that accused played
vital role in creating a cartel which
was formed between liquor manufacturers
wholesalers and retailers and finally
that the accused stands accused of
destruction of digital evidence out of
14 mobile phones used by him during the
relevant period of one year
foreign
foreign
foreign
[Music]
may I respond to him please
is it possible that these are pieces of
evidence that have so far been produced
by the Ed now the court is only judging
the case on the basis of what it has
said tomorrow it can find that all of
this evidence is also trumped up has
there not been cases where either the
court at a later date has said this
evidence is not good enough or even at
the level of trial the court has said
evidence
evidence case courage today if the court
wanted they could have said that Mr
cesodia's Case is totally trumped up by
Ed right
yes see at this stage the code is only
required to see whether the requirement
that the criteria is for taking somebody
into custody are fulfilled or not that
is section 19 of the pmla act so the
code has said that that the that the
ingredients of section 19 are fulfilled
so at this stage I can't say that the
custody or the demand is illegal and the
court cannot actually look into evidence
see this is the evidence collecting
stage again to stop you there at this
point the court is only talking about
procedure
that would also be premature and wrong
yes because because there's the
investigating agencies is still
collecting evidence they are saying that
we want to collect further Evidence we
want to extract something from him that
is why we need to do custodial
interrogation of this particular accuse
please grant that this is what the Eda
said the court cannot parachute itself
to you know to reach a stage of evidence
or to you know to synchronize evidence
at this stage at all that would have
been illegal so the court at this
distance is only said that they that you
know that the Ed has taken into custody
the ads produced him before me I say
that this is stage Prime officer there
is sufficient material against them that
this particular gentleman be sent to
custodial interrogation for a period of
seven days into
it's too early to be celebrating because
right now the court has only validated
the procedure that the Ed has undertaken
tomorrow they can well look at the
evidence given by Ed and say sorry this
doesn't add up Mr sasodia is completely
innocent Sanju Verma that is
I I let me be very forthright with you
the BJP is not celebrating because
Manish sodia is behind bars nor is the
BJP going to uh start shedding peers
crocodile or otherwise uh you know uh if
he continues to be behind bars uh I know
this sounds very cliche uh but I've said
this in the past and I'll say for
whatever it is worth that the law of the
land is taking its cause it Manish the
sodia is indeed innocent and the IDI and
the CBI cannot prove a water type case
against him uh then he will go scot-free
why but
uh why the victim car which is being
taken out after every few hours
[Applause]
will corroborate this in any case in any
part of the world
the witness is Paramount and I hope
people do not forget that under Section
306 of the crpc the Ed actually took
consent from the Delhi high court to
make Dinesh Arora an approval and Dinesh
Arora has clearly named Manisha sodia
and the other person who was not only
named Manisha sodia okay so arvind
kejriwan is
the poor man so let me tell you that
what the Supreme Court said in its
historical verdictions
hold on a second I'm glad you brought up
the witness because the other very
important name hold on a second which
was taken was of Arun ramchandra pillai
who also spoke of this South group and
the connect with Mani sisodia today Mr
pillai has put in has put in a petition
before the court saying I want to
withdraw my statement because it was
taken under duration tomorrow it could
happen to other Witnesses also it could
also let's come to them
please let me finish Dinesh Arora
statement clearly
indicting Manisha sodia and saying that
a surreptitious cabinet look uh you know
was not even fast uh suddenly he saw
that you know the excise policy found
its way uh into a Gom node uh with
various lacunae and loopholes Dinesh has
not changed the statement and mind you
Chandra shekhar today has also named
Manisha and said
that under the Indian Evidence Act of
1872 even if you yourself are refused in
a pmla case if you give your statement
to a sub inspector or senior level
police official that holds true fair
enough but again I'm saying to you that
all of this evidence and all of these
statements are being given by people one
of whom today has said it was taken
under duress and having said that here
is where I want to bring you in Krishan
because while Mr pillai may have said
that I was coerced there is another
person who is stated as witness
who gave a statement on the 23rd of
February
2023. we are talking about Buchi Babu
who is said to be the link between Miss
Kavita and Manish sasodia what has he
said in a statement I quote there was a
political understanding between Miss
Kavita and the CM and Deputy cm of Delhi
in the process has also met Mr Vijay
Nair on the 19th and 20th of March 2021
Vijay Nair was trying to impressa with
what he could do in the policy he was
acting on behalf of the Delhi cm and
mani sesodia he was working on the
excise policy on their behalf so here is
somebody who acted as a link and he has
given a statement saying that in Return
of 100 crores the policy was manipulated
by the CM and Deputy cm
well padmaja coming straight to the
point one these are all extra judicial
confessions and not judicial confessions
in front of a magistrate these are all
front of the officials or the officers
of the elite so definitely the merits of
the case will be when they are in front
of the court because as you have
mentioned that there are two witnesses
one who has retracted today and one more
the BJP spokesperson was talking about
Dinesh Arora approver let me remind you
ram Narayan versus state of Bihar 306
crpc clearly mentions that approvers
evidence is not a reliable evidence it
is
because he's just got a chance to speak
let him speak please yes I've heard good
teachings about pmla when when uh you
know the BJP spokesperson spoke about
bmla it was good to hear that you know
in pmla even before proven they are
guilty see I'm just showing this tweet
of the Ed padmaja the Tweet of the Ed
which is named a BJP leader Ys Chaudhary
why sujana Chaudhary of 6 000 crores
camp and operating 120 shell companies
why wasn't he arrested this is why we
are claiming Monday
I'm glad we're all showing pictures here
you are talking about how confessions or
statements are being made in an
extrajudicial fashion I want to show you
a picture which was a part of the remark
note today made by the enforcement
directorate this is a chat between Vijay
Nair and Mr Buchi Babu and it is of a
signal message that he got from Mr Nair
two days before the excise policy was
made public Mr Buche Babu had already
been given the excise policy on Signal
messaging app reviews
the simple question is Sir that if there
is a policy which is being formulated
even before the state gets to see it why
is this gentleman as a chartered
accountant why would he want to see the
delicious
you should answer it to the quota
I am we are a spokesperson
okay
let me ask you this out of curiosity was
Mr Buchi Babu the chartered accountant
slash advisor to miss Kavita yes or no
or did that relationship not exist he
was not the advisor or any kind of we
don't have any business relationships
with any one of them
that's what I'm telling you there is no
relationship with any of these people
with any of these people
you are welcome to hold up that picture
again like we said we're just putting
the facts out there all the people
concerned are also putting their side of
the story their facts the BR is saying
very categorically that Buchi Babu is in
the custody of the Ed he has to explain
himself there is no working relationship
or ever was between him the party or k
Kavita however these communications have
happened and they need to be
investigated which is why Mr sodia for
now is going to be in the Ed's custody
tomorrow is the questioning of Miss
Kavita as well we'll keep a very close
eye for the time bingo thank you very
much all gentlemen and Sanju Verma for
joining me
over the course of the last week we have
heard Congress MP Rahul Gandhi making
critical claims about India on foreign
shows and each of them being repeatedly
fact checked now it seems that the
owners of making factory claims has
fallen on some media houses after BBC
documentary on the Prime Minister that
was called a hatchet job the case in
point is an op-ed in the New York Times
the opinion piece in question has been
authored by Anuradha Basin executive
editor of the Kashmir times it is
headlined modi's final assault on
India's press Freedom has begun the
peace alleges that repressive media
policies are destroying kashmiri
journalism and media Outlets are being
intimidated into serving as Government
mouthpieces taking umbrage to selective
and fictitious portrayal of several
facts on ground Union Minister anurag
thakur today said that the nyt has now
dropped all protection of neutrality
against India and its sole motive is to
spread propaganda via fiction the reason
for this is not just the own history and
the background of Miss Basin but also
several of the examples quoted by her in
her piece to talk about repression her
very contrary to the actual facts on
ground
the things go against them then they say
that it's a propaganda
is such a contradiction now when the
truth is being covered with them because
they are not in they don't accept the
truth what they accept is that one side
that there should be praise and praise
and uh no uh negative side or real size
should be shown is
foreign
[Music]
why are you defending this piece
well I'm not I have not joined the
program to defend nor do I hold anyone's
brief to speak on this issue the problem
here is uh at multiple levels and I hope
you'll give me the time to make my point
uh you know last year the last year
reporters Without Borders came out with
a study about the state of Journalism in
India and According to which India has
continuously slid down from uh number 80
position in 2001 to 130 which means
India is in the company of pariah States
like North Korea like Afghanistan and
like China that is one number two is the
issues of the Crackdown that media has
been subjected to intensely over the
past can you get specific examples sir
because as far as concerned hold on a
second it's confined to let me let me
let me know
when we talk about generalities give me
give me one give me one
but it has been happening across India
Okay so
talking about generalities let me quote
to you specifically from the piece
what it claims and what the facts are it
says on the evening of October 19 2020
as reporters and photographers of
Kashmir times rush to meet deadlines
government officials and police swept
into the newspaper's office in the city
of Srinagar chased out staff and put a
lock on the door that remains to this
day isn't the fact though that actually
this particular property was assigned to
miss an Radha bhasin's father and as per
the rules after his passing away the
government is well within its rights to
take back the property
why is this being painted as some kind
of Crackdown on the organization that
she runs
what was the government supposed to do
let people just stay on government
property it's Mr jahangirally
like I said I do not hold any brief on
an I think she has made her Point really
very elaborately in her piece but but
the concern of Freedom uh the Crackdown
on media is something that has not only
been watched by the New York Times it
has been voiced at multiple Global
forums also and and if you remember
India is a signatory to the 2030
sustainable U.N sustainable agenda has a
question sustainable uh
like that no no you have quoted New York
Times you have quoted New York Times
where Anuradha has written an articles
then you said others have also quoted it
please quote others
right now has your voice been curtailed
right now I won't understand that of a
democratic India
no let now let's discuss the Bassin
family that is very important and
critical to understand the Basin Family
is supporters are the supporters of them
organizations
that it would be wrong to discuss
but father was her father was our father
is the problem is
just a second it is
hold on a second let's not talk over
each other before I bring in Amit Rena I
want to just remind you you are rightly
very concerned about the death of
democracy and freedom of speech under
the Modi government let me remind you
that the same lady Anuradha Basin also
spoke about how in 2009 the Omar
Abdullah Government tried to demolish
her offices and at that time she said
it's because we were writing very
strongly against the shopia rape and
murder so in 2009 also perhaps democracy
was dying in freedom of speech was at an
all-time low because the over Abdullah
government according to the same lady
was taking action against her but why
are you going after a family and the
opinion writer Amit Rana
see I I trust me in this panel probably
I'm the only person who believes in
absolute freedom of speech and when I
mean absolute I mean the French who are
the French way so uh so I have full uh I
believe that Anuradha has all the right
to speak what she wants to speak but
that also does not take away my right to
speak and and expose the agenda New York
time has and Anuradha has now let's look
at the history of the family they are
jklf sympathizers and officially
sympathizer it's not that some hidden
agenda
her father and she were present when
jklift opened the Jammu office in 2002
when they were questioned about the
killing of Air Force officers by Jammu
Kashmir Liberation Front and Yasin Malik
and Yasin Malik saying that he's Waging
War against India he did not respond in
fact he went he he went angry with the
journalist who asked that question this
was the freedom of speech
in in last 32 years the Kashmir times
has not written a single word against
the terrorists who have done academic
cleansing and genocide of kashmiri
Hindus in fact they have gone and called
the hero called Yasin Malik Buran wanis
and others as Heroes of Kashmir or as
great leaders of Kashmir and Radha
herself was vacated of the property on
and on and notice given in 2015. for
five years she kept on squatting on the
property encroaching on a property which
did not belong to her she was asked to
work at the property after her father
died but she did not die but the moment
the government took an actions he went
and played in victim card now if we go
to the article which she has published
she says the kilani's news was
blacklisted and it was not allowed to be
published I myself remember doing 25
debates of the same on National channels
channel on uh on gilani's death and
there was no way any government could
have suppressed the death of
and worse when you are writing an
article you are not even true to facts
let me quote to you example number three
from this article already has spoken of
Mr gilani we have spoken of being
evicted from her property now let's go
to the third example she says in 2019 Mr
modi's government abruptly revoke
kashmir's autonomous status without
public input from territories people
then of course internet was shut down
Etc internet speeds have been
excruciating slow sins what she does not
say that in February 2021 the government
issued an order allowing the restoration
of high-speed mobile internet services
not just that in January 2023 there was
a rollout of 5G services at least be
true to facts when you are saying that
India is in the dumps
foreign
foreign
foreign
foreign
[Applause]
[Music]
it is very apparent on the ground the
thing is that you can try and cloak your
own agenda as truth telling and
journalism fact of the matter is maybe a
New York Times will buy it but people
are actually living in Jammu and Kashmir
are way smarter than that because they
know one another they know the New York
Times I don't know what's happening in
their lives so they will judge in the
end what is fact and what is agenda I'm
going to leave it at that thanks very
much all gentlemen for joining me thanks

version of the bike so at launch we had
a five kilowatt version now we also have
a six below version of the bike and in
terms of timeline in the next 30 days
we'll be giving out the spec variants
and pricing
to the larger market we will be opening
up bookings for the motor motorbike this
quarter and deliveries
when we
in 2019 when we were you know starting
out we spoke to a lot of consumers the
electric bike
only a handful of players who are giving
motorcycles as a product
and
what we realized basically motorcycling
is
emotion driven
you name your bike you work with it you
control it you become one with your bike
foreign
all right obviously once we started
translating
and we've spoken to over 500 customers
on this clear indication
and that's when we said let's make
something that the consumers truly truly
want
as technology
let's make it when the journey started
we had to make our own Motors we had to
make the gearboxes the batteries the
electronics the entire vehicle from
scratch and nobody would have I believe
nobody would have thought of it maybe
EVS two wheelers
I think we are the first in India to
have actually put gears on a electric
bike electric bike
or an electric two-wheeler
definitely so while uh the Mata
motorbike sits in the 150 200 cc uh
range of vehicle we wanted to in line
with our vision of accelerating India to
Electric we also wanted to create Mass
market products and that is where let's
call it the sub 150cc because exact cc2
electric power train you're calling this
exe this is the concept exe so the
concept exe and the concept Duty both
are built on the same platform
both come with swappable battery both
can be so both are very flexible
platforms which allow you to accessorize
it a lot change it to the way which is
suited to you as a consumer best
both of them are connected platforms
in that sense they are very I'll call
them younger siblings after Mata
motorbike but coming down to the
swapping technology
but other shopping station
it is
ecosystem for us is we have done a
partnership with luminous power
Technologies another leading inverter
manufacturers and home documents and we
have created the home dog
the home dock is essentially
it's a
very fancy looking piece of Power
Solutions unit and your garden swappable
battery you can actually carry it home
and charge it in your home also
now the best part
if
you lose power in your house
the same home dog can actually act like
an inverter and power your house from
the same batteries you took from the
vehicle that's really cool so this for
us is the ecosystem so the home dock
concept exe concept Duty and the swap me
swapping station this is our future
roadmap in terms of where we are looking
at in terms of next Mobility products so
all of these will be out on the market
in less than two years
less than two years before the next Auto
Expo we will be there so those will be
here right now next door to Expo and
also I'm in a first-time job matter bike
on Wheel of ET we saw it for the first
time
the response has been phenomenal and the
reason is that with the right
connectivity Solutions navigation call
control music Control
the liquid cooling technology which is
cooling the battery pack the electronics
the motor
and the gearbox
apart from the looks and The Styling
consumers
find this to be the bike that they have
been asking for for the longest time
because
electric vehicles have been here for
about 15 years
in India and this is the first time that
they are finding something that really
really resonates with them
something that is really solved their
pain points all their need and with the
flexibility to do whatever you want I
mean this vehicle is also charged off a
5 amp socket we have showcased the fast
charges as well
now the consumers are waiting for us and
as I said this quarter will be starting
to take bookings and summer you will
have these in the hands of the consumers
this year
so one last question is personal when
can we get our hands on this kind of
when are we gonna so let's try it and
experience the matter I'll you're happy
to come down to Ahmedabad whenever you'd
like to and we'll let you run this but
what I would ask for you today here at
the auto Expo is there's a vehicle at
the back we have a dino here on the dyno
yeah but do give the gearbox a try
it's an experience you're never gonna
forget
so I'm gonna try it now that'd be great

back with some breaking news coming in
Rift widening in Karnataka Congress a
day after sitting Karnataka BJP mlc
putana resigned and joined the congress
party a divide has now erupted uh ticket
hopefuls protesting calling the
development and outsider's induction the
congress party leaders also get out
siddharamaya as well as dekeshav Kumar
foreign
's being transported in private Vehicles
evm being intercepted somewhere thrown
out somewhere does a serious election
look like this and wherever BJP has won
these kind of things have come out in
the media come out in front of our eyes
so we want the election commission to
have at most sanctity for the process
in the elections and we are trying to
help the election commission he has
resigned still he has not submitted his
application to the congress party he has
come to met him heard he has a discussed
with me he's fed up with the most
corrupt government of this country he
has already said on record that he has
never seen a such a corruption
government last 20 years so let me say
Seek his application first then I'll
come back to you
joining us on the broadcast with the
details Imran on one hand it's a setback
for the BJP because he is sitting mlc
has resigned and has said that
corruption in the government is
responsible for his decision he said
that there is large-scale corruption in
the BJP government and that's the reason
why he decided to quit from the BJP and
joined the congress party but on the
other hand we were also seeing
embarrassment for the congress party
because after he was inducted into the
party several of the Congress hopefuls
those who have been Congress loyalists
for a long time they have been
protesting saying tickets have not been
given to us they have not been promised
to the BJP mlc as well but why is it
that he is being inducted does this mean
that tickets are going to be given to
him so an outsider versus Insider
protesters breaking out within the
congress party after the BJP mlc pattern
was inducted into the party remember the
mlc himself said that there has been
corruption in the BJP and that's the
reason why he decided to join the
congress party but the congress party
the top leaders even saying that this is
a bold decision but the Congress workers
unhappy with the development
back with us so Imran for the congress
party as well it has sparked a divide
BJP setback yes but more importantly for
the congress party we're seeing an open
divide
thank you
well absolutely in fact and manohar in
fact confronted the senior leadership of
the party there both sidramaya and
dkumar over these issues and they said
that how can someone who's come from the
BJP which the party had been saying that
it is against BJP and against their
corruption and immediately after joining
is made him as a candidate for the
congress party from rajajinagar
constituency they demanded that the
honest party worker should be given a
ticket rather than someone who has come
from the party that too the principally
the congress party is opposed to the BJP
in saying that those in BJP are corrupt
and immediately after joining he's been
given a assembly ticket regarding this
there was Caracas happened inside the
party office yesterday when putana
joined the car while he was being
inducted and uh in fact several of the
Congress workers were seen cornering
siddharamaya as well as DK shivkumar

4Wdfd7bqWRU,Breaking News | Anurag Thakur Tears Into NYT For Spreading Propaganda | Article 370 Kashmir | India,Breaking News: Union Minister Anurag Thakur slams the New York Times over an op-ed on freedom of press in Kashmir.,2023-03-10T06:24:49Z,TIMES NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Wdfd7bqWRU/hqdefault.jpg,"welcome you're watching times now I'm
anakshi upriti starting the bulletin
with some big breaking news coming in
so this is breaking news coming in at
the top of VR Union Minister anurag
thakur has now hit out that the New York
Times for its article on Kashmir dated
the 8th of March and rock thakur tweeted
and I quote New York Times had long back
dropped all pretensions of neutrality
while publishing anything about India
nyt's so-called opinion piece on freedom
of press in Kashmir is mischievous and
fictitious it has been published with a
sole motive to spread propaganda against
India that's the big news coming in at
the top of this hour anurag Taco taking
pot shots at the New York Times but my
colleague is joining us live on the
broadcast Mohit these are some serious
allegations coming in from the side of
anurag thakur he's attacked New York
Times over an article an open piece
which was written in context to Kashmir
and he now says that the nyt has dropped
all potentions of neutrality
foreign
well you see there has been a thing that
foreign Publications specifically who
are trying to defend the present
dispensation are are
publishing various articles various
stories which in a way is demeaning to
the Democracy of the country and in turn
we see that how anurag kakul has hit out
at New York Times in a series of treaty
basically says that it's a false
propaganda by New York Times just like
the BBC and he also goes on to say I
just like to read it from the uh from
the tweets that are coming from
information and broadcasting Minister
where he says that New York Times had
long backdrop all pretensions of
neutrality while publishing anything
about India so he also goes on to talk
about the earlier articles from New York
Times the New York Times have tried to
defame uh the uh the the present
dispensation and the country we know
that how New York Times came out to
various articles during the application
of article 370 and how exactly the
freedom of pleasure has been suppressed
how people are facing problem but that
is not the case and we also know for a
fact that how he also goes on to say New
York Times so-called opinion piece on
freedom of prison Kashmir is devious and
fictitious published with soul motive to
spread a propaganda against India so the
union Minister for the information
broadcasting clearly says that it's a
propaganda to tarnish the image of India
and we have seen from past many years
there has been a trend from various
foreign Publications that were trying to
publish certain news which in a way
attacks the Democratic systems
which is now flagging it's a very strong
statement wherein he is called this
opinion piece which has been published
by the New York Times is called this
article mischievous and fictitious my
colleague Aditi is also joining us they
take us through the attacks which anurag
thakur has now Unleashed on the envity
Meenakshi time in again Western media
has been trying to create a certain
narrative against India and that's where
the India has a problem and right now
Union Minister has taken on the western
media now Union minister in a series of
tweets has stated that New York Times
had long back dropped all potentions of
neutrality while publishing anything
about India New York Times so-called
opinion piece on freedom of press in
Kashmir is mischievous and fictitious
published with a sole motive to spread a
propaganda about India moreover he says
that this is in continuation with what
New York Times and a few other link like
link-minded foreign media have been
spreading lies about India and our
democratically elected prime minister
SRI Narendra Modi ji such lives can't
last long
some foreign media nourishing a grudge
against India and our prime minister
Narendra Modi have long been
systematically trying to pedalize about
our democracy and pluralistic society
freedom of press in India is as sacrosan
as other fundamental rights democracy in
India and we the people are very matured
and we don't need to learn the grammar
of democracy from such agenda driven
blatant lies spread by New York Times
about freedom of press in Kashmir is
condemnable Indians will not allow such
mindset to run their decisive agenda on
Indian soil so in a series of tweets a
scaling attack has been taken by the
union Minister against New York Times
which has once again given a platform
for a false narrative against Kashmir
well absolutely and this is once again
the agenda of Western media being
smashed up by the government thank you
Aditi we'll go back to Mohit Mohit as
you saying earlier as well this is not
the first time that the nyt has come in
the government's crosshairs earlier also
time and again we've seen how this
present dispensation has always smashed
this so-called agenda propaganda which
is being spread by the Western media
against India
the democratic values and the image of
the country you know if you reach
certain articles from New York Times
during the time of lockdown how exactly
the state people have uh that India's
lockdown was completely mismanaged they
also talked about the vaccination but we
also know for the fact that how uh
almost almost all of our population is
being doubly vaccinated slowly and
steadily we are going for 100 double
vaccination and the vaccination of the
country our country is far better if you
compare to the other other countries so
we see that is a print that the trend
has to come in where the ecosystem
Authority the foreign
is being taken by democratically elected
government of the day and hence these
foreign Publications have no right to
Middle into internal internal issues of
the country now if you read that
particular article it talks about the
internet was shut down how journalists
were not allowed to publish their
stories how still the internet speed is
slow how exactly the Arctic obligation
of article 370 has not in any success so
it's clearly a propaganda machine and
that is why we see Union Minister for
information and broadcasting and has hit
out at New York Times and this has been
the case with a BBC now the prime
minister of the country was given
printed by the Supreme Court and sit was
appointed by the Supreme Court that
particular sit in 2013 gave into the
Prime Minister Narendra Modi but still
to better a certain narrative the
documentary was being published in the
country and then we saw that how it all
took a political turn now same is the
case with New York Times and health we
see the top-notch leaders and the
minister for information and
broadcasting has come out and called it
a simple propaganda
well absolutely as far as the government
is concerned is calling it a motivated
piece the bid really according to the
government is to spread propaganda
against India Mohit also take us through
what exactly uh was this article all
about which has upset the government so
much so far as to the minister today
anurag thakur claiming that New York
Times has dropped all potentials of
neutrality
well you see this particular article was
about the Press freedom in Kashmir and
specifically about the post post era of
the abrogation of article 370 this
article talks about the how abruptly at
a so-called abrupt decision was being
taken to aggregate article 370 and how
exactly uh the pro press is not being
allowed to report from Kashmir how
exactly the situation has not changed
from Kashmir house internet services
were shut down and now also the internet
services propaganda just like we had
seen at the time of the abrogation of
370 that's the charge coming from the
side of the government we also have our
Raja gopalan who's joined us on the
phone line morning so thank you for
joining us uh here on times now uh today
we are seeing anurag thakur take on New
York Times claiming that their article
on Kashmir is nothing but propaganda he
says nyt has dropped all potentions of
neutrality your reaction
my reaction is that you know when
article 370 was abrogated apart from
that Madam
should also realize that at the New York
Times write anything but last week Mr
raghul Gandhi and Madame Priyanka Gandhi
both were having scooty right on the
snow
what does it indicate the freedom of you
know the people there there was no
violence when Rahul Gandhi can visit and
who is the national flag had not choked
with all happiness
therefore let New York Times write
anything
New York Times correspondence in Delhi
should also be you know tried under the
legal scope to meet their financial
status should also be known because as
you are going after a Solace George
Solas there are indications that Josh
always is also financing New York Times
Indian agencies should find it out and
bring the truth out what anuragu the
minister said is absolutely correct my
understanding is that New York Times
vomit out anything let them emit venom
but the reality is that the delimitation
process in Srinagar is completed there
are employment exchanges opening there
is Lieutenant Governor Mr Manoj Sinha
has appointed a you know Jammu Kashmir
Public Service Commission the the Hindus
are given more space they must be so
I've given more space in the public
service examinations right therefore
democracy has returned in Jammu Kashmir
that New York Times blabber anything so
you're trying to censor as far as
Kashmir is concerned you know that's on
the path of development but it is
foreign media some sort of agenda which
is being played out which is not really
focusing on the path of vikas which the
state of Jammu and Kashmir rather the UT
of Jammu and Kashmir is on uh and
continues to be fixated and writes these
articles against India
yes you are absolutely right you asked a
pertinent question my pertinent answer
is let New York Times editorial team
consists of 10 members from New York let
them come and stay in Jammu Kashmir for
one week and write about it without
realizing it those who are paid
journalists paid media paid news
Gathering or all work at work thanks to
George Solace financing certain media
horses also which is a disturbing Trend

a Funny Story it's interesting that it
comes up in social media The Minister's
plane landed a little early in Delhi so
she was one of the first ministers to
land and on on Thursday and we had to
transfer her to the conference center
and we said you know this is a little
early why don't you stay in the plane
for a while and she said yeah yeah let's
stay in plane and she had some breakfast
and
um and then spontaneously she decided to
leave the plane without the receiving
line being a forward but that was an

with Indian protocol I can only say

Journalist Matt ...,2023-03-04T16:05:27Z,TIMES NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TkGgHPb0Zk0/hqdefault.jpg,"the meanwhile we quickly shift our Focus
to another very concerning update is
expressing your pro-hindu sentiment or
putting Tweets in the favor of the bjpr
crime can this get your account blocked
or suspended while a sensational
disclosure has been made by the American
journalist Matt taibi who has exposed a
U.S funded fact check research group
according to him U.S Think Tank Atlantic
council's digital forensic research lab
in 2021 sent the names of 40 000 Twitter
users to Twitter the group had accused
these users of allegedly engaging in
inauthentic behavior in support of the
BJP and Hindu nationalism and it
suspected them of being paid employees
or possibly volunteers of India's
bhartiya janta party Andy Garwin
managing editor and Senior fellow of the
dfrl in an email to Twitter attached a
spreadsheet with the names of 40 000
Twitter accounts the only reason why
they wanted these accounts to be banned
is because of their Pro Hindu tweets
however Twitter checked the accounts of
these 40 000 names and found them all to
be real people and mostly Americans who
had not stepped foot in India and were
not Hindu so that's the concerning piece
of news coming in let me quickly go
across to Aditi to put this in
perspective for us and take us through
the kind of Twitter handles Aditi that
were hand-picked that was selectively
targeted and they were seen as being
pro-hindu is why they wanted to Red Flag
all of these Twitter handles
it's very easy for a US Think Tank to
just come across and say that these
Twitter accounts are we are listing it
as a pro-hindu narrative fiddling
Twitter account but it's not easy to
prove and hence this time it has been
proven that it's not easy to just attack
Hinduism and then tag the pro Hindu
Twitter accounts on social media and say
just block them no Twitter has manifest
has debunked the claim of the U.S think
tank and let me go go across to some of
the Twitter accounts that were actually
highlighted by the think tank saying
these the reason for censorship was that
they had just tweeted in Pro for pro
Hindu tweets these accounts bookwormless
then there was an account of Tara Hindu
Roy deal these were the real accounts
these were not Bots that the US Think
Tank said that there were some birds
Hindu shaini these are some accounts
which were tweeting in favor of BJP and
these were the accounts who were
tweeting some pro-hindu narrative but
the U.S Think Tank labeled them as Bots
and said that these are being run as a
BJP employee or they are being hired by
the BJP and they are doing some agenda
but Twitter you know fact checked them
and said that these accounts are not
Bots but real people and these accounts
will not be banned just because a US
Think Tank thinks so so this is what an
expose a has been done by the Twitter
himself and this is what the claim has
been done done by the American
journalist absolutely and when we in
fact put out details of what these
Twitter handles were all about some of
them had nothing to do with the BJP
nothing to do with India as well very
concerning thank you Aditi for joining
us with that update let's talk about the
dfrl's statement they've come out with a
statement on their part and have made
claims uh and have have issued a
statement on the claims made by the
American journalist the fact check group
claimed that they be represented wrong
facts and misinterpreted events his
reporting contains errors and omits
contexts as well further stated that the

to know as a big snuff to China the U.S
lawmakers have now introduced a bill
reaffirming arunachal Pradesh is an
integral part of India where the U.S
lawmakers have said that the resolution
makes clear that the United States views
arunachal Pradesh as a part of the
Republic of India and not all the
People's Republic of China whether U.S
lawmakers introduced this bipartisan
bill of real farming arunachal Pradesh
is an integral part of India these are
two United States senators that have
teamed up to introduce a bipartisan
Senator resolution affirming America's
recognition of arunachal Pradesh as an
integral part of India saying that in a
press statement that at a time when
China continues to pose a grave and
Gathering threats to the free and open
indo-pacific it is critical for the
United States to stand shoulder to
shoulder with our strategic Partners in
the region especially India now it has
been introduced as a bipartisan Senate
resolution that comes a clash between
India and China in the Eastern sector
along the loc El AC in the last six
years that has been reported rishabh and
what the American Senators have been
saying that they value supporting
freedom and rules-based Order must be at
the center of the actions and
relationships around the world
especially with India
gee this is a very important development
when it comes to U.S India relationship
this is not just a you know Bill that
has been introduced by what Republican
or Democrat this is Joint bill by a
Republican and a Democratic senator in
the U.S Senate and this holds some
importance which shows that we
Republicans Or democrats both see India
not as an ally but as a friend and uh
you know the strong work used against
the People's Republic of China given as
aggression and a unilateral uh you know
trials to change the situation at Lac
this shows that USA stands firm with
India and this is something that will
hold importance in the subcontinent as
well as the region when it comes to
indo-pacific region this will hold an
importance because this shows that be it
Democrats or Republicans both the major
parties of United States stand alongside
India when it comes to India China you
know uh formations that we have seen in
balwan or the latest one in the savang
so there's also you know is something
that China has been claiming uh uh you
know its territory under one China
policy and though U.S agrees to One
China policy but now has in a reinformed
that the state of arachal Pradesh and
this becomes operated the state of
arunachal Pradesh is integral part of
India which means that China do not have
any rights and whatever is under Chinese
control is just occupation illegal
occupation by Chinese authorities and uh
People's Army of China you know on
Indian Territory so this is very
significant coming in from the union U.S
Senate two senators one from Democrat
one from Europe Republicans it would
strain the ties between the U.S and
China we've already seen this
commissions over the Chinese spy
balloons there and China also reacting
and calling it as an overreact on part
of the United States how further would
it strain the two countries ties
so we have seen a
uh between us and China well in
the U.S shot down uh an Airship claiming
that it was any you know size ship then
China confronting U.S saying that there
were 10 such instances where the U.S
Airship crossed over the airspace of
China Only Yesterday China has you know
blocked locket Martin and a U.S defense
uh you know manufacturers to do any
trade and investment in China even that
it had sold weapons
a big boost for India and a big snuff
for China equally this is the United
States viewing the Indian state of
arunachal Pradesh is a part of Republic
of India and not the People's Republic
of China and the commitment to support
India is coming from the United States
of America rishab thank you very much
