joLk0IPEniA,WILL RAFALE BE A FACTOR THIS ELECTION? | FACEOFF WITH ZAKKA JACOB,"RafaleTwist DAY BEFORE POLLS, RAFALE BLOW TO GOVT SC TO EXAMINE CLASSIFIED RAFALE PAPERS 'STOLEN' ...",2019-04-10T16:41:10Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/joLk0IPEniA/hqdefault.jpg,"unanimously rejected the government's
contention and its objections to what it
said was stolen documents stolen Raphael
papers some of which were published are
in the Hindu newspaper today the court
ruled that they will examine these
papers and these papers will have to be
taken into account when the review is
heard and that the review of the raffle
judgment the original judgment of the
Supreme Court from December of last year
will be held on its own merit question
we're asking tonight is will raffle be a
big factor in this election that's what
we're going to be debating here on
faceoff but before we get to that let's
place on record what exactly happened in
court today what is it that the court
said because in the politics of all of
it a lot of it is getting confused a lot
of it is getting mixed up in the din
this is what the court observed this is
a government's contention and this is
what the court ruled today the
government's contention its argument was
that these review petitions which have
been filed by Arun Chaudhary Prashant
Bhushan and Yashwant Sinha are based on
quote/unquote stolen documents this was
the legal line taken by the Attorney
General
KK vana Gopal the Supreme Court in its
order today unanimous three-judge bench
order said that these preliminary
objections are dismissed the
government's contention in court was
that these stolen documents cannot be
admissible as evidence in court because
they were procured as after the console
as a consequence of an illegal act which
is stealing of documents from the
Ministry of Defence the Supreme Court
today ruled that the review of the
raffle judgment has to be heard on its
own merit and that these documents are
indeed admissible as and when that
review hearing takes place the
government's contention was that some of
these papers contain very very sensitive
national security details a leak of
which is an offence it violates the
Official Secrets Act and therefore
cannot be put in the public domain today
the court has explicitly said and this
has far-reaching implications that the
right to information of the public
whenever there is a larger public
interest involved far overpowers any
notion of secrecy
of course has very very far-reaching
implications but let's be absolutely
clear about what happened in court today
all that has happened today is that the
court has said the review will be heard
and as in when the review will be heard
these documents some of which were
published in the Hindu will be
admissible those documents will have a
bearing on the review that's all the
court has ruled today but that has not
stopped our politicians because Rahul
Gandhi right after filing his nomination
papers and immediately claimed
vindication he went on to say that the
Supreme Court has now admitted that
there was corruption in Rafah the
Supreme Court has admitted that jockey
dad saw him while the court has said no
such thing and that of course
immediately gave fodder to the Raksha
Man 3 the defense minister who came out
and said that Rahul Gandhi is in
contempt of court listening to the
political reactions and then will go
straight across to our guests
[Music]
the three judges have given a unanimous
judgment in which they have rejected the
government's argument the Chief Justice
said that by a separate order we will
fix a date for hearing the review
petitions and they will be heard on
merit Supreme Court made clear Kathy I
eat chocolate rg8 Jory Caron by saying
this that codename manlier sake doctoral
Tokido I mean anil ambani Coweta nafisa
dannika manlier hey this verge on
contempt of Pope
in the wake of Supreme Court order a
false perception is thought to be
created that it is a big setback to the
government this perception is wrong
today's Supreme Court has demolished
that lie of blinchik of the prime
minister also and the truth is that job
Raphael ki jury may choke heed our chore
ahead there's a lot of twisting of facts
there's a lot that's getting lost in the
political dinner I want to leave that
aside for a second I want to first
before we bring in our guest before we
bring in our guest panel I want to first
go across to the man who broke some of
those stories under whose byline the
Hindu carried these stories is for my
editor in chief of the Hindu newspaper n
Rahm thank you very much for speaking
with us here on CNN news 18 I want to
first ask you your thoughts on today's
judgment by the Supreme Court unanimous
judgment by all three judges ah they
have said that a the documents some of
which you and your people published are
admissible and the review petition has
to be heard on merit so as far as an
unbiased investigation into raffle is
concerned do you believe today you've
been vindicated this judgment says the
publication of the said documents in the
Hindu newspaper reminds the court of the
consistent views of this Court upholding
the freedom of the press in a long line
of decisions commencing from Romesh
topper was his state of Madras and
bridge Bhushan was the versus the state
of Delhi so this is why I call it
historic because it goes right back to
the romanced upper judgement on you know
where the highest court in the land has
upheld it's not only upheld freedom of
the press
it has derived through judicial
interpretation freedom of the press from
freedom of speech and expression which I
and in a sense
freedom of the press has been put on a
pedestal as we give in a special place
because they actually talk about it okay
from freedom of right to free the
fundamental
to freedom of speech and expression so
this is a very is a wonderful part of
this judgement and another observation
another observation in the judgement is
on the Attorney General submission that
Rafal disclosures threaten national
security yeah
Supreme Court it courts from the from
the iconic 13 judge bench kesavananda
Bharati verdict where it said that
judges must keep you know keep aloof to
give legitimacy to their decision to
keep aloof from the din and controversy
of policy politics the primary duty is
to uphold the Constitution or in yeah
this I think is a resounding affirmation
of what the role of the judiciary is so
whatever you think about this decision
or that this is something that
absolutely I mean as much as you know
the court quoting the the 13 judge
verdict in a sermon on the party which
up which upheld the basic structure of
the Constitution but I'm more interested
in the nuts and bolts of what happens
from here on hence because Rahul Gandhi
has come out and said that the court has
virtually admitted that there was
corruption in Raphael that chalkida arch
or hair but in a sense the reality is
the issue now begins with the review
petition the review petition will be
heard by the court on merit challenging
its own judgement from December of 2018
do you believe in a sense the issue is
going to get a new life starting today
on or is it settled this issue is over
yes this issue has been settled that a
that you can publish these documents
okay and not only that that the
Constitution of India strongly protects
your right to do it and the Supreme
Court of India as they have holder of
the Constitution well is on your side so
insofar as the right to freedom of the
press is concerned because there have
been concerns in recent times you know
pressures on this free speech freedom
the present freedom of the news media
even then on digital platforms and so on
harsh measures taken against people who
post things unjustified harsh measures
or and also this climate of fear that's
been around in the media ecosystem and
in the polity which makes many of our
colleagues either silent or even take
positions that baffle us or shock us
sometimes okay
so all that I think this helps I'm not
saying everything has changed but this
is suddenly something that's been
settled but but in favor of free speech
and freedom of the press fair enough
and finally in terms of you know where
this story is moving in in the political
sphere clearly because it's come a day
before the first phase of Elections
we played out what Rahul Gandhi said
right after filing his nomination papers
the defense minister has said that this
is on the verge of contempt of court do
you believe the real issue of raffle and
whether there was corruption in Rafael
will get lost in the din of politics
more so now in the next six weeks or so
once the election kicks in I think this
will enthuse those who see the
unanswered questions in the raffle deal
or you know I use these words carefully
but what it's seen as that a foul
scandal by opposition parties you know I
think they they will take quite a lot
from this especially as the government
wrongheaded Lee took the stand invoking
the official secret I'm not talking
about the Attorney General here but this
is the position of the government yeah
the Official Secrets Act and so on and
in making you know ridiculing and
attacking quite viciously at times the
the right are right to investigate now
you answer the questions if you say
you're not disputing the authenticity or
the documents on the contrary by talking
about stolen documents or yeah photo
cover documents
authorized Italy photocopied your only
authenticated these documents okay with
the exception of that charge that it was
cropped which I didn't yeah I think all
that they have done has only helped us
in showing that what you have is real
okay people want to know I think for the
most part except those who are already
converted to the other side they want to
cover up why why on earth I'm refusing
to disclose this why on earth were they
so slow in in giving information to the
supreme court
okay I think all these things will now
be taken up all right and ROM thank you
very much for speaking with us here on
CNN news 18 and we'll see I'm sure we'll
hear more from you through the course of
the next few weeks and months as a
Supreme Court sits in review of its
judgment from December 2018 on the
raffle case let me now bring in our
panelists let me expand this debate now
I'm in Malby a spokesperson on the BJP
Sanjay Jha spokesperson of the Congress
I meet chaudhary lawyer Yashwardhan Azad
is a former Central Information
Commissioner and here in our studios
we've got particular pen geo political
and strategic analyst Amit Malviya you
heard from what the court said today you
heard from an Rama moment ago is this a
setback to the government coming as it
does 24 hours before the first phase of
polling
Zaca let me just put in context what the
court has said today it has merely said
that even wrongly procured documents
will be considered for review the review
petition is pending in the court the
petition challenging the supreme court's
word date on raffle has been dismissed
the CAG has looked at the document and
it has given a clean chit of the deal
the Supreme Court in its own judgment of
December 2018 has clearly said there are
commercials on procedure and an offset
they have found nothing incriminating
that they should be worried about or
comment on now that is exactly what has
happened in Supreme Court today nothing
more nothing less
if you read the judgment today page
number 18 point number 12 it is very
very
clearly elucidated there okay other
point on the politics of it and the
optics of it Rahul Gandhi today again
attributed to the Supreme Court things
that the Supreme Court did not say mean
or even allude to it was in gross
contempt of it
he continues to lie and his lie has no
takers the fact is that people know the
truth about Rafael and thirdly and last
point I heard in Ramah speak the fact is
that n Rahm and his publication did put
out crop documents and another media
agency pulled out the entire document
the whole country has seen it and when
Supreme Court takes this matter to
review they will look at it okay I will
just wait enough yet again to find Santa
job you know all that the court has
ruled today is that these documents some
of which were published by the Hindu
will be admissible in court as and when
it takes up the review a how is that a
setback and B how does how does role
gandhi say that the court is admitted
that yes there is corruption in Rafael
the court has said no such thing as
occur if there is any before I answer a
question this is a response to Nirmala
Sitharaman comment if anybody is
committed contempt of the supreme court
of india it is the render and remote the
government obviously trying to protect
that in their motive who's a corrupt man
here in this in this entire defense
transaction they lied to the supreme
court in an affidavit that the CAG
report gave them a clean chit and that a
redacted report was presented in
Parliament and was in public domain
absolute rubbish they lied to the
supreme court is a contempt of court
secondly and this is a very interesting
part where mr. Dahl Gandhi is coming
from zakah look at the document that is
now going to be evidence ask why don't
the viewers know the know the truth
Narendra Modi's government tried to
conceal and stop that and obstruct the
process of the Supreme Court reaching it
as evidence the Supreme Court has said
you are wrong so Narendra Modi's
government is in the docks now what is
one of those critical documents akka
they actually
you and I'll tell you this is another
violation of the of the of the affidavit
given to the Supreme Court those
documents tell you that the Ministry of
Defense on record says that there were
parallel negotiations these are the
words
okay guerrilla negotiations being done
by the prime minister's office and the
BJP has written to the supreme court
saying there were no parallel and
negotiations by the PMO it was being
done independently by the Indy buddy
what was called as the int which was the
a negotiating team now there have been
caught three times lying to the Supreme
Court I think this issue now becomes
extremely German because it is about
corruption involving the Prime Minister
of India who's been trying to duck it by
not having a jpc but now the Supreme
Court will look into it we all know that
the Prime Minister unilaterally reduced
the number of aircraft for 120 C know
what once again I was paying can I just
benefit of our viewers for the benefit
of our viewers say what some of these
documents that were put out by the Hindu
suggest number one as Sanjay Jha said
that there were some members of the
indian ago she ating team who had said
that there were quote unquote parallel
negotiations by the PMO some members of
the inte had put out a dissent note
saying that this deal is not better
he's not on better terms than what was
offered earlier that the delivery
schedule was slower that the
reasonability of the price offer has not
been established it does not meet the
requirements of the joint statement as
announced by the prime minister and the
French president in April of 2015 it
also says that there were no
negotiations on price of enhancements
and that Frances price offer was higher
than that of the Eurofighter this is a
dissent note would this dissent note a
particular plane make a material
difference when the Court hears in
review its judgment of December 2018
first of all Chaka when it comes to the
issue of I personally don't think it
will make a difference but that is again
my opinion first and foremost there is
nothing called a parallel negotiation
for the simple reason that is are the
words by the ears yes yes I'm just I'm
just saying that as you have quoted for
the simple reason is here was a deal
which was hanging in balance for three
years
in the last ten years China has added
four hundred of to its fleet and we were
this was deal was not going forward for
two particular reason the sauce refused
to give guarantee for Hal made
manufacture planes Hal was asking for
two point seven times more price which
if it was allowed by government it would
not have remained l1 therefore will not
have remained l1 okay so that is a
diesel now when it comes to the issue of
here all is PMO outside finish is PMO
outside government that it can't be
monitoring a project that's number one
issue about India specific enhancement
and all that we have done a comparative
analysis as the price at which Qatar got
the plane what it you've got the plane
and it was almost the same price at
which India got CAG has said that the
benchmark price was unrealistically low
in case of both UPA and in case of NBA
glut in case of India specific
enhancement CAG report says not that it
is seventeen percent cheaper when it
comes to when it comes to the issue of
cost escalation every year UPA deal had
asked for three point nine percent cost
escalation they have agreed to that in
this case it was one point to two
percent capped at 3.5% because European
inflation is never more than one point
five per K yeah this is my viewpoint as
me let me expand this to both yes there
are the two panelists also awaiting once
one second to two other panelists were
waiting Arizona's odd and to some ho3
Yeshua's on Assad you know these nitty
gritties these technical details have
been gone into a by the Supreme Court
and B by the CAG these documents I don't
know maybe material in changing the
opinion of the Supreme Court may not be
material in changing the opinion of the
Supreme Court but at least insofar as
what has happened today the court has
said that these documents are admissible
when it sits in review is that does that
suggest corruption does that suggest
Malafaia day does that suggest any kind
of wrongdoing or the favoring of one
party as Rahul Gandhi says theses are
corrode no Jovan okay Hudson liquor anil
ambani KJ middle dia does it suggest any
of that
you asked exactly the right question no
political party actually suffers or
gains hugely by Supreme Court decision
Supreme Court decision has two aspects
one is the establishment of the primacy
of the RTI Act and that is to deal with
the admissibility of the information
which came out in Hindu now it's a
pathfinding judgement because they have
stressed that the OSA that is the
Official Secrets Acts is outdated number
two it is overridden by the section 22
of the RTI Act which says very very
clearly that if an action is completed
then the public has a right to know
about every deal the government makes
the question is not official secret
right the question is of national
security the question is has the
publishing in Hindu that information
impacted national security or not
obviously not and the purchase has
already gone through therefore it can be
made public and if somebody asks a
question under the RTI I can tell you as
an ex Central Information Commissioner
that it has to be answered but what that
takes pare that takes care of this part
of it now the other part is what are the
issues which have come out in the Hindu
in any case number one is that there was
differences in the price negotiating
team but this is also a fact that the
price negotiating team held about 76
meetings and out of the eight members or
11 members if three of them were
differing so be it so the government can
easily now release this because the
final action has already been taken the
other part which was also mentioned was
that there was a parallel negotiation
which is being done by the PMO now if
the issue is if you are talking about
sovereignty rights if you are talking
about other issues which department is
in a better position to do that the PMO
or the negotiating team so what I'm
saying is these are issues which will be
clarified it's unfortunate the last
point which I am making
it's unfortunate that the all these
things was not looked into by the CLG it
was expected that the CG would go into
the procedure very very deeply it was
expected that the CAG would go into the
pricing very very deeply I'm giving to
understand that the French government at
the macron had said that they had they
have no objection will be the pricing is
released and so be it
except for the operational part that is
the weaponization of the aircraft
variously harm now in revealing these
things to the government I don't know
why the government is hiding all these
things it should be absolutely open
Samir Samir Chaudhary I think you're
sure the nozzle is right in as much as I
think the far-reaching implication of
today's judgement you know may or may
not be restricted just to Raphael alone
what the code in effect has said is that
if information is sought under RTI and
comes under Section 22 1 of RTI where
there is a larger public interest
involved then even if it is in the realm
of national security then there's
nothing wrong in publishing that or
putting that in the public domain
how would you read that part of today's
judgement absolutely the primacy of the
Right to Information Act has been
superimposed yet again by the Supreme
Court's decision but what is relevant
Sokka today is that the review of the
judgment of December of 18 is limited to
error apparent on the face of it so the
argument that was raised was that
firstly the Supreme Court was mislead
into the passing the order in December
2018 and secondly by concealing these
documents which have now been annexed to
the review petitions specifically there
were two orders by the Supreme Court
earlier in the writ petitions wherein
the parties were called to put on every
debate or in sealed envelopes all
information relating to the procurement
process as well as the pricing now these
documents the government tried to defend
these documents saying that these
documents were unauthorized ly accessed
so therefore they could not be relied
upon and was stolen but by putting aside
the submission and establishing the
supremacy of the RTI Act it has become
clear that these documents will be
looked in
- now whether it was an error apparent
or whether the Supreme Court would was
misled into passing the order in
December is to be determined on the
merits of this but once again what I
what I am curious and I think what we
all want to know is these documents that
have been put out by the Hindu are in
the public domain the information in
that is is public knowledge now you have
seen it I've seen it everybody on this
panel has seen it the question is do
those documents give out any information
which suggests to you that a information
was withheld or on these three counts of
procedure our pricing and and
enhancements any Malafaia intent was
there to favor one party over another is
there anything in this that suggests
corruption is what I my is what I'm
getting at or like you said that
information was deliberately withheld
from the court see suggestion of
corruption is a question of fact but
what is relevant is these three
documents show that there was
disagreement with respect to the
procurement process there are
discussions about the price which is
exactly what the Supreme Court wanted to
look at while those orders were passed
and the fact that these documents were
not supplied in the first place shows
that the government was trying to
conceal something now that what is that
exact nature of the information that was
sought to being sought to be kept away
from the court is what needs to be
determined and whether it was relevant
to the inquiry in question
I mean Malviya the government could have
easily shared these documents with the
supreme court when it asked about
pricing and procedure whether they were
parallel negotiations by the PMO or
whether the question of bank guarantee
and sovereign guarantee I mean it's
normal to have descent notes I don't
think it's abnormal to have descent
notes in a defense deal that is spread
over a period of five plus years what
why would the government not have shared
this with the Supreme Court what makes
you say that these documents were not
shared with the Supreme Court in the
first place because code was saying that
it wasn't rolling these were against
Official Secrets Act that was the
government that was the Attorney
General's contention the primary
submission I'm quite sure if you
I don't let me clarify let that McLaren
submission yeah
was that the review petitions yes what's
go ahead yeah what instructure's because
it because it relies on stolen documents
yeah um it okay go on yeah go on
zakah the limited point that I'm putting
forth is that anybody on this panel I'm
sure is not privy to the document that
was given to the Supreme Court now if no
one on this panel knows the documents
that were given obviously they would not
know whether these set of documents were
given to the Supreme Court or not the
Supreme Court took its time it reviewed
all the document and it came to the
conclusion that on Trice process and
offset there were no deviation now now
the fact remains that if there is a
certain set of documents that have come
out the Supreme Court's opinion today on
the admissibility of this document
merely relates to the fact that even if
documents are procured wrongly they
could be admissible in the court when
the court looks at this document it
could say that we have already seen
these documents and our opinion of
December 2018 factor ins these documents
and there are no new revelations that
have been brought to us or if there is
something that they haven't seen they
could look at it afresh but from the
documents that have now come out there
are two sets of documents one that they
Hindu put out which was a crop set of
document and another set of document
which is a complete set of document and
those documents do not suggest anything
untoward malla file or otherwise and it
their fold as the supreme could look at
it no no this entire process does not
lead to any kind of conclusion that aids
of the government with health
information to the supreme court would
decide otherwise when they look at this
whole set of document and third the
allegations made by Rahul Gandhi which
are bogus anyway then every time yeah he
speaks he speaks lies no no no I mean as
much as that I agree with you that Rahul
Gandhi has made a huge gigantic leap of
faith by suggesting that the court is
admitted today that there is corruption
in Rafael coda said no such thing but
let's be absolutely clear
I want to get Sanjay on this let's be
absolutely clear that if these documents
were indeed mail made available to the
Supreme Court while it was hearing this
case in the first place then there was
no need for the Attorney General to take
the position that these are stolen
documents and the review petition needs
to be dismissed for to it because this
is based on stolen documents so let's be
clear about that but having said that
Sanjay Jha someone was the preliminary
argument yeah was that zakah the
preliminary argument taken by the
Attorney General was that the review
petition should be dismissed in Leh
exactly because these documents have
been wrongfully obtained exact not be
looked at exactly exactly thank you
thank you for explaining that in in in
in lawyer terms but Sanjay Jha we have
seen these documents ah no no once again
Sanjay Jha we've seen these documents
none of these documents suggest that
there was mollified a intent
none of these documents suggest that
there was corruption
none of these documents suggest that you
know one party in this case Anil Ambani
was unduly favored this is a descent
note which is powerful cause on any
defense negotiation Misaka let me tell
you if that was the case why would the
government actually try and obstruct you
know letting the documents be treated as
evidence clearly your viewers know that
Narendra Modi and his government had
something to hide
why that's a fundamental question what
is the motive well now let me tell you
why mr. Rahul Gandhi is bang-on right
and why mr. Narendra Modi will probably
get many sleepless nights over the
coming weeks did you not read the
Ministry of Defense noting they said
that we discovered we discovered that
there were parallel negotiations being
done by the PMO gets Ravel's from the
French so this is the point this is I
think the key point of the documents
that the Ministry of Defense was not
aware of what Narendra Modi's PMO was
doing because the PMO kept the Ministry
of Defence in the dark and the Indian
Ministry of Defence doing one of the
biggest transactions ever
discovers it from the buyer which is the
French I think the scandal is so obvious
can you imagine nimbala Sitharaman did
not know or Manohar Parrikar in this
case did not know what Narendra Modi was
doing why it's so
straight forward even the CAG report
which i think is extremely halfway
points out that the sovereign guarantee
and the bank guarantee were actually not
charged on the sword and therefore give
the sort of massive profit because they
didn't have to you know pay any
Commission's or fees or show any
collateral at all
so you actually give a sweetheart deal
anil ambani you gave a massive brotherly
hug to dassault and you kept your own
government in the dark which is why I'm
telling you sucka this is an
open-and-shut case of corruption and
when mr. Rahul Gandhi says chalky
thought you're eight today I can tell
you we are saying it with legitimate
confidence but the great particular plan
first of all defense procurement that's
in your 2013 section 71 created by
drafted by UPA gives ample opportunity
to the government of the day to deviate
from the standard procurement procedure
when it comes to acquisition of
strategic weapon systems no fair enough
that the members of the in second selves
did not know that they were parallel
education no so that is what the note
say I think that was a root sighs there
was a reply from party car himself that
time and he said that it was an
overreaction
secondly when it comes to the issue of
sovereign guarantee and back guarantee
number one I mean what stops Rahul
Gandhi on Congress to show any deal that
was done during UPA time which had a
sovereign guarantee have they been able
to show the bank guarantee was I was not
gonna weigh you had air marshal Cena who
was part of the Rizal negotiation team
he said when you are directly dealing
with OEMs then you ask for a bank
guarantee you do not ask for a bank
guarantee when you have any sovereign
country in between so that is the thing
now this is an intergovernmental
agreement based on intergovernmental
clauses
it has it is not a deal where you have
competitive bidding happening and an om
is so when an OEM is there you ask for a
bank guarantee what it specifically says
that if you section few five point four
of defense procurement procedure says
that's what once again hypothetically
what once again hypothetically if this
deal fell through
right then what's the guarantee for the
money that India would have paid as
advance there has to be some form of
guarantee right first of all the whole
idea of having a bank bank guarantee
they have already given for the offset
the section you have the money
paid in a bank which is controlled by
French government where the money's
being deposited and that is a monitoring
team consisting of the saw and Indian
Air Force who do the review and
eventually pays the money now here is a
prime minister of a country who says
that I am guaranteeing it in the letter
of comfort here is a company which has
been dealing in this country for a long
period of time that the soft plane
recently went mirage 2000 and did what
it has to do on bala cod do you think a
company of that kind of repute do you
think a country of that kind secondly is
there any I mean you talk about PA type
aside and deal c-17 deal c-130 deal with
United States did they have a banker
Indian sovereign guarantee you ask the
Congress to show those papers it will be
problems okay Sanjay Jha quickly and
then I need to go to your browser
quickly quickly
yep acha acha let me tell you why I
think the Supreme Court admitting those
documents today become critical guess
what the Ministry of Defense says the
Ministry of Defense says and this is a
noting by very very senior responsible
bureaucrats that the Prime Minister's
office is undermining our ability to
negotiate a good price it says so in
clear terms it also mentions that they
if the PMO wants to unilaterally handle
the deal let them say so but then it's a
clear manifestation that the defense
procurement procedure was violated and
by the way how can you forget what frogs
wha what Francois Metro said he plays
sorry what Olin said Hollande went on
record to say that we were told that
Anil Ambani
will be the interlocutor in the deal and
it was told to him by Prime Minister
Modi so here you are I think there is no
defense for movie at all no I think we
are deteriorating deteriorating we are
deviating from the issue in Arizona Zod
but can you please explain to our
viewers because one of the things that
has been cited in the in the Hindu
report is that the hint or at least some
members of the end in this dissent note
had said that they are concerned about
this bank guarantee being waved off is
that a critical factor because
particulate plain suggests that there
have been defense deals in the past and
certainly in the ups time that have gone
through without bank guarantees or
sovereignty
mr. mrs. ah that that question is to you
yes warden Azad yes yes yes you're
absolutely right I think as per the
Precision's goes there is nothing wrong
in the deal which has actually been done
in fact we are steering away from this
debate by focusing on corruption aspect
there are a lot of other important
issues which need to be stressed and one
is the defense acquisition Council the
procedure of acquisition per se and how
to make it better for the future now in
this case most of the issues which have
been brought in have been absolutely
procedural
let me again go back to the RTI Act
which talks about the a section 8 one
way that is exemption from giving
information in case that information
impacts national sovereignty there is no
such problem in this case because the
deal has gone through and we are talking
about the issue of national security
which is outdated and also visual
Secrets Act
the other issue is also the section G
which says that anything which you have
with the foreign government in
confidence cannot be released but we
already are aware that as far as the
pricing details go the government didn't
have any objection if the Indian
government would be giving out any
information okay therefore the issue of
big corruption being raised all the time
can only be found out after
investigation the main issue here is
that review petition has been admitted
on the basis of admissibility of
evidence it goes no further
and does not say anything beyond
somewhere is there anything for us to
believe that what happened today might
be a major factor or might even go to
the extent of the Supreme Court having
to review its previous judgment because
all of this material other than the
documents published in the Hindu were
made available to the court whether it's
on price procedure or on offsets and the
court in its wisdom was convinced in its
own words
these suspicions can't be the basis of a
fishing and roaming experiment have we
found anything in the public domain
through the Hindu or otherwise in the
last 3-4 months post that judgment which
might force a real evaluation of the
court's own judgment I would not go to
that extent to give a finding to that
effect see because you should not over
read into today's judgment what today's
judgment is done is that the review will
be heard on merits and these documents
which were being disputed by the
government will be looked into so I
would limit myself to that I would not
draw any conclusions as to the
corruption or the optics of the judgment
for today okay I guess we leave it my
way I'll give you the final word 24
hours before the first phase up and
chalky torres manor a slogan for for
rahul gandhi for the last one year at
least he had sort of given it a bit of a
breather in the last three four weeks
since election dates were announced but
do you believe in the next six weeks you
will have to counter that again
politically not at all shaaka because i
go back again to making the point that
the raffle decision remains the petition
challenging it has been dismissed by the
supreme court it is only the review
petition which is been filed on the
basis of fraudulently recovered
documents has been admissible and it is
only a judgement that underlines the
procedural mechanism and nothing else
nothing beyond then that and morale is
going to be here in September 2019 will
have a much more potent air power with
the joining of Rafael and that is the
reality
alright Sanjay Jha ten seconds what well
Jacques I just want to tell you this
rumbling away I'm making all kinds of
noxious and he re
without your head okay India's political
rhetoric political rhetoric from BJP and
Congress and we've heard a lot of it in
the last one year I am afraid we might
end up hearing a lot more in the next
six weeks or so through this campaign

the BJP released its manifesto today for
the looks of my elections and one of the
big focal points as far as the South is
concerned is shabarimala seven months
after the Supreme Court verdict which
allowed women of all ages to pray in the
temple and the massive backlash that
followed the BJP manifesto today states
that the party will undertake every
effort to ensure that the subjects of
faith tradition and worship relating the
shabarimala are presented in a
comprehensive manner before the Supreme
Court the BJP also says it will protect
all issues related to faith and belief
remember this had become a huge talking
point as far as the BJP is concerned
they were hoping to politically benefit
out of it but how's that translating in
this campaign right now in Kerala let me
go across to neater over Kumar who is
joining us live from Thiruvananthapuram
payal Mehta he's joining us from the BJP
party headquarters where the manifesto
was released some hours ago payal
clearly there is hope in the BJP that
they would like to translate some of the
anger that was seen amongst the faithful
on the back of the shell Rimula issue
but clearly what is happening on the
ground is I'm not sure that the BJP has
the organization or more importantly the
candidates to electorally benefit from
the anger that emanated out of Shambhala
clearly you know more than more than the
BJP you know it these are the the state
of Kerala is where the RSS has really
really put a lot of effort together and
that's one of the reason that they would
like to see that are translated into
some kind of a vote it seems more like
an RSS imprint you know as far as the
state of Kerala and of course largely to
do with sub Diwali issue is concerned
now on one front where the BJP speaks
about protecting the faith at the belief
and the rituals you know associated of
course over your eye mentioning about
supreme Allah there are questions are
being asked of the BJP what about at the
faith and the belief of other religions
you know because you've heard Asaduddin
Owaisi come out and lash out at the BJP
signal wire then interfering with the
muslim laws why you then pushing in for
criminal why you pushing in for
criminalization of the triple Telok so
all of these questions are something
with the BJP really has to answer but
you know as far as the state of Kerala
is concerned they do understand that
that's probably one of those
last bastions that is still left with a
communist or the left government still
exists are they've been able to
successfully wipe out the left from
Tripura after our coming into power
after many many years of Manik Sarkar
being in being in being in government
over there so that is something which is
there on be japaese listen you've seen
the kind of aggressive you know sort of
campaigning etc that the BJP is done
right through that entire Sabri mala you
know movement over there and even more
they are trying to do what they can eat
so even if they are able to achieve a
couple of sees at least you know because
in an estate where Zachary don't have
any any leader at all for then that'll
mean a massive moral victory
alright let me also go across the knee
Telugu Kannada joining us from
Thiruvananthapuram I mean very rarely
does one single issue decide an election
as emotive as sharp Ramallah was clearly
there are far greater mundane factors
that decide the results of elections
whether it is candidate selection
whether it is you know party
organizations so on and so forth amongst
the the twenty seats in Kerala what are
the realistic chances what are the
realistic hopeful seats as far as the
BJP is concerned if it were to open its
account this time around
Kazakh among the 20 states realistically
if you look at it it's only in fear even
in the poem that they have a real chance
where they can make some change and as
we were when we speak to people within
the BJP we understand that they also
know for a fact that it's not like
across the state this is a major issue
for BJP in Thiruvananthapuram and it's
not just supreme Allah even last time o
rajagopal came second Shashi Tharoor won
the seat with a margin of about fifteen
thousand votes so it's in pyramid in the
Purim constituency that they keep their
best bet they hope that they have a real
chance here and now though the BJP is
trying to focus on the shabarimala issue
and bring this out as a major issue this
would not be the one factor that would
be deciding the 20 seats for sure in
pyramid and the Purim and Putnam theta
they could have some impact because of
this but across the state we are not
real we really don't think so that
shabarimala can have a major impact
across the state this is a state that
had witnessed one of the worst floods
farmer distres in a Dickey in vinod
areas post flood rehabilitation all
these are issues that would come in the
forefront when it comes to an election
not just as the petrol prices the diesel
prices the LPG prices going high all
these are major factors that would be
coming up in this election so though the
BJP hopes that Shabri Mela is one thing
which they try to say across the state
that may not be the one deciding factor
this elections in Kerala one of the
critical things that's happened in the
last week or so and I was in Carroll
over the weekend the decision by Rahul
Gandhi to contest from why not at least
if you speak to Congress folks seems to
give the impression that that will have
a ripple effect there was a time three
four or five weeks ago when it seemed
like a 50/50 election between the LDF in
the UDF now it's clearly advantage UDF
not least because of wrong Gandhi's
decision but amongst other factors as
well this certainly is a critical one I
want to thank both needed over Kumar and
payal Mehta for joining us on this issue
of shabarimala where the anger seems to
have dissipated a bit but is the BJP in
the best position is it is it in pole
position to capitalize on that anger
primary
directed against the LDF government
against the printer.i government
meanwhile the CPI M leader and politburo
member brinda karat has called the BJP
sham Ramallah promised nothing but an
election joomla after the supreme court
gave its judgement the RS is supported
it the RS is claimed it is a RSS agenda
to encourage women to go into all
temples they said it with such pride why
did they not go to the Supreme Court
then so these are just election joomla's
that is all it is

this is reporters project in CNN news 18
reporters have fanned out across the
country to cover the looks of elections
for you April 11th is the first phase of
polling in these looks by elections and
it's a critical date for Andhra Pradesh
not only will the people here elect 25
MPs they also decide whether or not to
give Chandrababu Naidu and his Telugu
Desam Party another five years to govern
the state what sets this state apart
from other states during election time
is the role that money plays
all those Andhra MPs are Koror patties
and if you want to contest and win
elections here whether it's the state or
Parliament elections you better have
lots of money and if you look at the
Election Commission of India seizure
report up to April 4 2019 95.7 9 crore
rupees have been seized in Andhra
Pradesh this is hard cash 95.7 9 crore
rupees of cash has been confiscated I'm
not even talking about precious metals
like gold and silver that have been
picked up so why does Andhra have this
tradition rashik assalam explains
it's boiling hot on the campaign trail
and guntur's mpj they've Gala is out on
a truck seeking re-election for himself
and the Telugu Desam Party with Vic
Laird assets of 680 crore rupees in 2014
gala the u.s. returned entrepreneur and
managing director of the am Raja group
is a richest MP in India not a bad thing
in a state where it's said that we'll
have a winning chance a candidate must
be able to spend at least 30 times more
than the 70 lakh rupees budget mandated
by the Election Commission we are people
who perform and we can go to the public
with our performances are in our track
record and let the people judge based on
that other parties if they're using
money power and trying to match them is
becoming more and more difficult so I
welcome any move to cut down on election
expenditure especially cash movement and
cash expenditure I think the Election
Commission has cracked down a lot on
visible expenditure but they have not
been able to do much on invisible
expenditure and I look forward to a day
when that is controlled even more in
kala drops the chart of the richest NPS
in India his state shares a similar
distinction analysis by the Association
for democratic reforms shows that Andhra
MPs are way richer than MPs from other
states so if the average annual income
of an MP is a little over 30 lakh rupees
the average income of the Andhra MP is a
crore that's 70% higher every single one
of the 25 MPs from other Pradesh or
crowd bodies a feat that only this state
can brag about not surprisingly Andhra
voters expect all contestants to open up
that first rings come election time and
the party's blame each other for the
situation the YSR Congress is betting
basically only on that if you see their
campaigns you don't
people you only see trucks moving around
with some kind of entertainment or some
kind of recording but you don't see
people following them or going around
anywhere so where do they get their
confidence coming from is the
electioneering tactics Prashant Kishor
and his team and muscle power and money
power is what why our CP is counting on
and we need to counter them poke lori
vara prasad or pvp the wires are CP
candidate for the Vijaywada looks about
constituency is making his political
debut this year the business magnate
owns colleges malls a movie production
company and multiple properties across
the country he symbolizes the
established trend here that is that a
third of the candidates contesting looks
over seats in Andhra Pradesh are
business tycoons or wealthy NRIs making
a guru op see a close aide of party
founder president Jagan Mohan Reddy PvP
was accused in the disproportionate
assets case along with Jagan but has
been given a clean chit he says it's not
fair to spotlight just Andhra with the
role money power plays in the elections
it's a problem across the country not
just on the finish you go to Punjab you
go to Mara store you go to Karnataka you
go to Tamil Nadu across the board the
country has become like that what can we
do and why do you think that is a
production I wouldn't have a clue I
wouldn't have a clue I would have a clam
only I can just be candidate I'm out
there meeting people
if people's expectations are the
candidate should spend our party doesn't
have the resources
none of us have the resources to spend
what we have is people behind as a
bridging of the devil
he points to the populist schemes and
freebie culture that dominated
government policy in the region for
affecting water expectations during
elections it's an uphill battle to
convince a voter so you need to spend
more time and energy you know obviously
with your pitch out there persuading the
water out there and over the past three
decades across most states have been
pushing hard various populist measures
by the government obviously not a single
politician wants to commend directly on
the dubious practices that all parties
indulgent to win elections but the facts
speak for themselves
so far the maximum cash seizures in this
election season have happened in the
state 95 crore rupees in hard cash in
just four weeks since the election dates
were announced this is in addition to
the gold liquor and even drugs that have
been confiscated the fact that the
assembly elections are coupled with the
looks of my elections has just raised
the stakes for all the parties the per
capita income of India is less than 1.2
lakhs per year and the average income of
the sitting in pieces 30 lakhs if you
take India as a whole
it's nearly 30 times the national
average so we talk about representation
of various groups of people caste
communities gender religion etcetera
etcetera but we also need to ask who is
representing the poor because none of
the MP seem to be representing the poor
in the nineties consciously the
wealthiest people who were sucked into
the politics until the time that was not
the case when NTR came to come into
politics on his party 25,000 rupees per
constituency was a big expenditure but
in the post entire phase when there was
a desperation for power to
extraordinarily ambitious talented
individuals it politics says there
the core of their being mr. Chandrababu
Naidu from TDP mr. Dodge security from
Congress both were very similar people
for them money is not the issue politics
the main thing so they have started
encouraging and enticing that richest
and the wealthiest people to come into
politics
in 2014 the TDP and vice versa we had a
would share difference of less than 1%
Chandrababu Naidu CDP had thirty two
point five percent while juggins ycp had
32.1% yet that translated to 117 seats
for TDP and why sorry we had only 70
seats in the 175 members simply when one
person would shake and make such a huge
difference between victory and defeat
the desperation show seven more both the
leaders in the last few weeks have been
in a whirlwind campaign trying to close
that one person gap besides spending
money
they're also picking up emotive issues
we are fighting for the last one year
vehemently we are going to Rhodes
makings darkness even including they
sent in no confidence and also big
Dharma in Delhi everybody supported
except to be happy this man is saying I
will get special status if I get 25 who
may will support Congress said very
clearly we are for it
all our / - political parties I mustered
they are always me then who may is good
to support again BJP how can I get with
BJP five years they didn't give now he
is with BJP he is using all their
forward for his corrupt practices is
getting money your TRS is sending money
[Music]
all the allegations and counter
allegations come down to the same point
in these answer elections money is the
main weapon ironically the richest party
in the country the BJP is on the
backfoot here meet vaanga VT Narendra
BJP candidate from the villa wada
east assembly seat the former bank
employee has declared assets of 51 lakh
rupees and though he comes from a
political family
he says when voters asked for cash he
simply can't obliged earlier their
political leaders is they used to go as
their problems they used to inquire and
they used to clear whatever all the
issues during these five years plan but
nowadays they are not even the people
are also habited that there before the
elections if you are coming to our
location there are these many votes one
person will be representing them and you
will be asking sir I will cast this many
votes for your party
what is our stake that expectation it
was started with 500 rupees per vote now
it is almost reached three to four
thousand rupees so it so in the
districts there's three to four thousand
rupees per war yes
so is it like anybody can go then go out
there and give them three thousand four
thousand for what they'll vote for the
party obviously it is happening that's
what is happening
unruhe voters will be voting for the
first time since the bifurcation of the
state in June 2014 voters say they would
like to prioritize development and real
issues for the role of money in the
state is too deep rooted and well
entrenched to be discarded overnight
Andhra Pradesh has come to symbolize the
worst aspect of Indian democracy and
that is how the unchecked role of
illegal money is making power the
preserve of very few and very wealthy
Indians how will these people be true

there is a [ __ ] at work to correct
that and no it's not the one that Prime
Minister Narendra Modi has been
describing as Mohammed Abu the Mohammed
Bandhan that I'm talking about is a
massive one across India lakhs of
volunteers affiliated to 600 civil
society groups are getting together to
get people and politicians talking about
the real issues before the Indian
democracy today these people dress in
the colours of the Republic are talking
about things that should really matter
70 years after we became independent
during elections the expectation is that
people's issues should be center stage
unfortunately what we are seeing today
is that other sorts of issues are coming
in which which are not really relevant
to the lives of the people who need to
go out and vote and they are taking
center stage and therefore there is a
dire need for civil society groups for
members from the public for people to
come together and to really raise their
voice ruling party wants to evade the
real issues the opposition doesn't want
to bring the real issues for the last 4
years
where was the leading opposition of this
country
in fighting on issues of farm distress
on unemployment on education on health
no they're not there at all so when
these issues were raised which were
raised by farmers movements by the youth
movement the opposition wanted to
benefit but when these move issues have
been erased suppress the opposition is
in no position to raise it again these
groups say the opposition has failed to
give voice to the simmering anger among
waters on basic issues of price rise and
jobs nor has it offered concrete
solutions politics a marriage or
democracy or possibly a competitive

case show focus address cossack time so
the Congress manifesto was released as
week the civil society Alliance says
there on the surface it seems like the
party is bringing the focus back to the
real issues and though they welcomed the
Congress promise to bring in a law to
punish hate crimes the parties peddling
of a soft Hindutva line especially
during the state elections and it's
silence on the attack on a Muslim family
in gurugram unholy
makes them skeptical about its intent
the kind of fear that is settled down in
the hearts and minds off of
in ordinary Muslims Dalits in different
parts of the country something that
should be a matter of of great concern
in shame to have the Indian in New
Zealand you know has recently shown us
what a true leader can do which is to
show to reach out to show compassion to
stand in solidarity with the victims and
we haven't we haven't I mean our prime
minister of course hasn't done it but so
also there has been a timidity in the
part of the of the opposition parties to
raise these questions and I think that
it is built around a kind of assumption
that the large majority of Hindus are
now radicalized and communal eyes and
they will not appreciate the raising of
questions then that is why some society
needs to actually bring this question
center stage
remember the farmers march in Mumbai and
here in Delhi well the fact that there
has been finally some response from all
political parties including the Union
government they claim is the result of
what public mobilization and pressure
can chief mainstream established parties
ruling parties they were caught unawares
they never thought that farmers can be
so agitated so assertive
so when farmers demonstrated their
determination and their capacity to vote
against parties then they got frightened
and they started thinking about how to
respond to that so this is beginning of
their response system also so what they
know best what they know best is is the
non serious propagandist kind of majors
and they are resorting to that
but while agriculture is finally getting
its - activists say that critical
subjects like education and health still
don't make it to campaign speeches and
the election agenda although they do get
a mention in most manifestos this my
personal path Solomon Dole our
government a school bunt away in the
name of consolidation half-heartedly say
League in Congress nice go escobar mm
hola kimochi participation currently are
12 education khun liang but they are
also not making a focal agenda education
because they are not considering
education is a prime component of the
the paradigm of development with phase
one of the looks of our elections slated
for April 11th there is too little time
and the task at hand is mammoth so the
call to action to voters involves
chance' bars like this one rallies
marchers human chains door-to-door
campaigns whatever it takes to drive the
point home either in person or through
social media we need to energize
all the work that is already happening
on the ground we need to come together
to coalesce to mobilize movements
campaigns people groups who are already
working on this and actually reach out
to the voters and and which and they are
the ones who are actually part of this
campaign point taken but on May 23rd
when the woods are counted and a new
government is formed how will our maha
Bandhan of civil society groups assess
if they have been successful this is not
really about what this party don't work
for that party all we are saying is
there is an election at least let's talk
about the real issues and this complete
derailment of election that has taken
place
it's almost hi Jackie you know I know
you had booth capturing this is a mother

been captured earlier booth capturing
used to take place with gun and with the
muscle power this capturing of the
elections is taking place with media and
money forward the entire election has
been distracted so we are making an
attempt to bring it back to the race
that's what the campaign is all about
[Music]
India's date where destiny comes every
five years the next opportunity will be

overshadowed by the rhetoric of caste
religion and a polarizing debate on
nationalism it's time to think of what
really matters to us because after 2019
up in our time pants Alba Dhaka how
effective that effort will be in the
context of electoral politics is
debatable but one thing is crystal clear
if that effort is successful and makes
even a small dent we'll all stand to
benefit now we have a third story in
reporters project today as news comes in
that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will campaign
for the Congress party in states other
than Uttar Pradesh Zorc who's been
tracking her on her road shows files
this report on the impact she had so far
these pictures are not just from any
Congress rally this is a yo-yo and
people in the temple town came out in
full strength to witness Priyanka Gandhi
vatra as far to face about looks of her
constituency a yoga had voted for the
BJP in 2014 but it has voted for the
Congress in the past in 2009 but
Priyanka on the campaign trail the
Congress party hopes to woo these waters
back and as interest and curiosity is
any indication then the Congress
definitely has a better chance than it
has had in recent times
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
clearly Priyanka's entry has galvanized
energy and enthusiasm among the party
workers who have been in disarray since
the Modi wave of 2014 on her third tour
of Uttar Pradesh in two months Priyanka
hit the road from Lucknow to the Gandhi
bastions of a meaty and ribéry Lee
before getting to Ayutthaya in three
days and across 300 kilometers Priyanka
set the tone for the Congress campaign
in the state
a blistering direct attack on the Prime
Minister
[Applause]
but like the party Priyanka is taking no
chances and has woven in a direct appeal
to the Hindu community in her campaign
so temple stops are prominent whether it
was the kashi vishwanath temple in
varanasi or hanuman gurdy inner youth
young but she stayed away from the
makeshift Ramlal a shrine at the
disputed Ram Janmabhoomi site mamby
saying that the Athiya Roadshow has
confirmed what the Congress was banking
on the Priyanka effect in reviving both
the party kada and it's four choose most
workers who were part of her I owed her
roadshow see it was a momentous occasion
to see the Congress colors all over a

was hard to find any sign of the
Congress anywhere fifty year old

from unscheduled stops like this one in
her Doya village in Faizabad
that she had homemade good chutney too
intimate lookers of hers Priyanka's
approach is characterized by an easy
physical contact and warmth she is happy
to sit in a huddle and hugging comes
naturally but not everyone is basking in
the warm exuded by Priyanka from calling
her a hypocrite to dismissing the impact
she will have on the poll outcome the
BJP is clearly not impressed speculation
that she's only fuelling with her
cryptic remarks but Priyanka Gandhi
Vadra has managed to do at the very
least is wake up the demoralized party
terracotta even the slim hope of her
contesting Lok Sabha elections has
filled the worker with new vigour and
new energy but is that going to be
enough to make an actual dent into the
BJP vote bank a task some would say was
easier accomplished six months ago but
with Lok Sabha elections just around the
corner well Priyanka Gandhi Vadra be
able to convert curiosity into words
while you can't deny that Priyanka
Gandhi Vadra has stirred things up the
Congress party claims that they are
seeing an uptick in the number of people
especially women who are signing on as
members now if she contests elections
it's going to take this game to a whole
new level

She will be the Congress ...",2019-04-06T10:28:52Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iLlUz3a4zDg/hqdefault.jpg,"[Music]
film stars are no stranger to electoral
politics and every Lok Sabha election
some of them cross over either a star
campaigners or as candidates now this
year in the Lok Sabha elections of 2019
making a splash was the announcement
that popular Hindi film actor Urmila
Matondkar had joined the Congress party
not just that she is the party's
candidate for the Mumbai north
constituency on off-centre today I'm
going to find out why Malala has taken
on this new role why she's made this
plunge and what she expects to do if she
is to become the MP or lawmaker
representing this region of India or
mullah you're right in the thick of
things and so it's lovely that you're
actually sitting down to do this
conversations thank you thank you so
much what I find interesting is that as
you begin the campaign experience and
you've begun it right you've started
meeting people you're here in Mumbai not
what is it like because as a movie star
you're used to fans you're used to
people but it's also always they koma
get those days into true very true in
fact that's my one of the first things I
say to them that so long it was I was on
the silver screen and you were far away
there and I am amongst them and that's I
think the biggest Forte I've started in
fact meeting them from the biggest one
of the biggest slums in our constituency
Hanuman Nagar and it was awesome because
for an actor because the adrenaline rush
that it gives you to see the excitement
to see people's you know euphoric faces
kids going berserk with all the drums
playing around and on it's quite amazing
and at the same time it is also quite
upsetting because you get to see the
kind of the states in which they are
living in those areas and that kind of
motivates you and makes you think that
okay maybe you're trying to do the right
thing as a movie star and especially you
you know when you were at the peak of
your career or muhammadun car was not
someone who is easily accessible and
that helped with the mystique and here
you are you have to make contact you
need to connect with people through how
do you prepare for this new role
it's funny you mention that because it's
true and there's a kind of duality to
the whole thing so as a film star I was
like that and almost reclusive because I
believed in being spoken for my work and
not what I choose to do in my private
life if I've got a dog and what breed is
it and probably and my dogs
you know those kind of trivial things or
many more that actors can really
indulgent however here what is happening
is the whole sense of the whole thing is
to be amongst the people but don't
mistake it for my not my lack of wanting
to be among some people I have come from
a very very middle-class family and my
growth has been tremendous in terms of
you know become getting into films and
then becoming a star and even bigger so
I can never forget my roots and that's
the beauty of it all and I think the
entire credit goes somewhere on the line
to the upbringing that I've had where
one of the earliest things I remember my
father telling me is like famous like
dewdrops you know so it's there in the
early mornings beautiful mornings till
the time the Sun rises and shines and it
evaporates so don't just your fame and
name shouldn't be like the dew drops it
needs to be there to to stay and that
only stays if your work stays and your
work speaks for itself that's what I had
believed in on the day that this
announcement was made you said that film
stars are used to bring glamour and draw
people to political parties that's not
wrong but keep that aside for a bit
where I am concerned why should people
keep that aside for a bit we're or
Muhammad or Karis concerned what is it
in your work experience that makes you
eligible to be an MP from this area or a
politician II it is not about whatever
what from my work my line of work makes
me how it makes me Anita eligible it is
the kind of person that I am and I have
I have grown over the years to become is
what makes me eligible so I come from a
family which is extremely socially aware
I was made aware of my social
responsibilities very very early in my
life and what people don't know today
that I come from a very very humble
background but as a child for many many
years me and my brother never had a
birthday celebrations because in our
capacity whatever my parents could
afford that money was given to some of
the other social institution at that
time there is an unknown in Nagpur there
is there many such a smaller big
Institute's so I don't have a concept of
birthday parties or something and I'm
not saying this I never have said this
till date but I'm only saying it today
just to underline my background so when
you come from and I was always told
about people like be filmmakers be it
actors of yesteryears for whom this was
not a separate thing
this was very much a part of being an
actor actor is not someone who's out
there if you are an actor your social
responsibility is even higher because
everything that you are is because of
the people who make your star that is
why that so I have done movies like many
Gandhi konima or Binger because I saw
those social relevance in them I thought
that that was my bit so whenever have
spoken about the promotion of those
films and apart from that many other
causes there have been involved with
except I never believed in Tom talking
about it on the social media and in fact
never spoke about it because I think
it's in a bit of a bad date if you're
doing something getting pictures clicked
with write really downtrodden
and you're putting it on your social
media I don't know I find it a little so
you're saying that this is not a role
that will be so difficult for you to do
a full-time politician's career is not
going to be a difficult role for over
Mela see it essentially you need two
main things to become that one is
extreme sharp social awareness social
political economical awareness another
thing that most people don't know is
that I was an extremely extraordinary
good student extremely extremely good at
my academics no matter what I did so I
had 87 86 % in 10th then I still took
arts because I wanted to study
literature and I was majoring in
philosophy in psychology so I have and I
remember reading ever since I remember
anything at all but this is not
this is not what politicians des
necessarily need for instance Gopal
Shetty who's the incumbent MP from this
constituency I was looking at his record
and I think he's not studied very far at
all you know so it's not formal
education that a politician means in
what I'm trying to get at is what we are
here we are recording this conversation
in carnival I can t believe there is a
bore evilly char cope these are all part
of this Mumbai not constituency what is
it that you think you need if you were
to become the MP for this constituency
that's exactly what I was coming to so
that being the first part for me that's
extremely important because that gives
you the in-depth knowledge of what
you're talking about okay that gives you
a basic solid base for your personality
from there to take office to wherever
you intend to come into the second part
I think it is having empathy for people
is there having empathy at all basically
for issues for people for things in
general so I think that is where my
personality comes from now coming to
this particular thing like I said that I
was asked questions like has she even
ever ever been to bravely I have I'm
very much a Mumbai car I've been to
pretty much all the areas of Mumbai and
like I said because ever a humble start
I have been everywhere so what is
important what I feel I bring to the
constituency and my political start our
career is that the event is that you
know this complete social inequality
which is kind of you know coming to the
you know the society on many levels
needs to also somewhere be address needs
to be and things need to be done about
all of that so that is why I'm here and
also for the last five years I have been
looking at it as a citizen of the
country tremendous you know unrest is
there demand is intolerance has come up
suddenly everybody wants to you know
they want to there is a religious
intolerance there is a you know things
are not anymore about moving forward
towards progress things have pushed us
backwards in our thinking you know and
there are many many extremes that is
always you there have been extremely
disturbing circum
chances great intellectual thinkers who
are trying to make changes in this
social scenario like a inaudible car
pants sorry gory Lankesh they are killed
in broad daylight I get goose flashes I
even speak about it so many years have
passed and nothing has been done about
it so the extent where the where the
High Court has to intervene and ask the
CM of the state that after having 11
different departments why as it hasn't
anything happened about it I was a very
keen follower of Marina couple ker I
believed in his ideology and it was
completely shocking that he was just
taken away one find even a man has gone
for a walk I think it is time for every
citizen to sit up and take notice what
you're articulating as the intolerance
as this sort of actual murder the brutal
murder of intellectuals and therefore
ideas what they represent is that the
trigger for you because or milla given
your popularity and your you know just
your stature as an actor you would have
had offers previously right absolutely
2019 why not 14 because that's exactly
the reason last five years have been
extremely disturbing and I was trying to
keep out of it
I was I was one of those people and a
lot of youth needs to listen to this
because I was always oh I don't want to
get into this political thing oh I don't
want know whatever it's not gonna work
anymore like why not you need to be
politically aware because our country is
going somewhere else
I mean Supreme Court judges need to take
a press conference to tell people that
you know wake up and smell the coffee
because these are all the institutions
which are under tremendous danger today
because if they don't work in the manner
that they are meant to democracy won't
survive so it's the idea of India that
you think everyone usually come forward
and yeah at this point oh yes that's
what you don't get upset up and make
difference right now whether it is with
a vote or whether it is giving it a
voice is going to be very very late so
the Congress manifesto has been released
and it's very clear that the Congress is
talking about jobs some of the things
you've mentioned the kneei scheme when
you think of when you go through all of
the things that the Congress wants to
promised elect in the electorate when
you are out in your constituency how are
you going to communicate some of the big
ideas that your party stands for today I
think the the bestest thing that my
party has promised people of Bombay
especially is the slum redevelopment
project wherein we have promised them a
five hundred square foot houses and it's
going to be a task it's going to be a
challenge because trust me in this
constituency particularly there are some
slums and slums and so I can't say the
biggest slum because one is bigger than
the other so that needs to be taken to
them and of course the night your
generation itself is very very
accomplished very very again challenging
but doable because it's not it's not
like one is you know it's it's first of
all a direct transfer scheme through
which people don't have to go through a
neo Jinnah for which they have done it's
a direct transfer to keep of cash yes
and offer them a basic level of you know
decent life lifestyle or whatever that
they you know at that level they can
they need to keep up so that I think is
the biggest highlight about that
particular scheme so I those two and
particularly for me the six percent of
going for the further education is also
as interesting even though it's slightly
minor point because to me education is
the most important thing and of course
the 33 percent Women's Reservation being
on being a woman that's of utmost
importance so when an MP gets elected as
you move around and you're meeting
people and having meetings are they
expecting you to do things for the
constituency or are they both going to
vote keeping in mind the Parliament and
which party forms government how do you
think voters are looking at an idea like
she is going to be more of definitely
the person first and then the party I
don't know actually how it works but I
think it's a bit of both there are
people who are staunch supporters of
part certain party certain ideology and
then there are going to be people who
are going to think that okay this person
could do something
and mood for them so I think it's a bit
of both it's a bit of both so if I want
to understand how you're assessing your
chances of victory here because I would
imagine you're here to win you've got
into this race to win and not to lose
and yet a lot of people especially
people from the opposition parties or
the incumbent BJP here would say that
you know we are not afraid at all
because our sitting MP Gopal Shetty has
defeated your colleague Sanjay Nirupam
in the last elections by over 4 lakh
vote margin so we are not worried about
over Mela I'm a drunkard are you being
set up to fail I think that's great for
them I think it's fantastic for them I
wish I'm in such position anyway coming
to the point well I don't want to talk
about whether they're happy or sad that
I am Here I am I think my the trolls
that have been made a scapegoat off and
many other things that they have stooped
down to I think answers itself that they
worried you think no no I'm not claiming
they're worried why would they be there
parties in the power and power is the
biggest thing in this country so I would
think they may be not about it but the
point is that I think let us leave that
to people to decide what I'm not getting
is why the media has made this gentleman
to be such a you know to me the the
biggest ruler or the biggest person in
in democracy is the person who have
people's heart
they have people's votes so he had in
2014 and so did many other people
because there was a wave of a sort going
because so much was you know offered to
you and so much was you know it was
going to be delivered today the question
however becomes in five years has any
party managed to take the country down
so much on every level I would like to
remind you of those horrific days of D
monetization where people are standing
in lines people didn't worry even there
was there's so many questions on every
level economic level different I mean
unemployment has it gone to this level
ever before I mean what do you talk
about farmer suicides it's honestly I
don't know where we are and
ultimately indefinitely their religious
intolerance this constantly trying to
suppress the voice of anybody who wants
to say anything which is right at all
because what is the right is only
decided by the government so this
country is already going towards a
dictatorship so you're saying that you
are not concerned about whether they
feel that they are going to sail
you know sail through again and that or
melam a tone curve and the Congress
party do not pose a challenge that is
not you that is not my concern right now
but you want to win is that yes of
course
nope I definitely don't fight a war to
lose definitely not so I am going to do
everything in my power to get out there
connect meet my waters pick my people
because I think there is only one hero
in democracy and that's the people
itself you talk about religious
intolerance and you've been the victim
of trolling on one big count and that is
the fact that you're married to a
Kashmiri Muslim businessman now what has
that that personal experience of having
an inter-religious marriage made you
sensitive to in terms of what kind of
you know attacks are made on these
grounds on people that's been horrific
that's been the worst thing I think they
were expecting me to get scared and run
away see basically this is what exactly
I'm talking about if big actors speak
about the well-being of their children
and in what kind of society are my
children growing up and they're showing
concern over it they're asked to go to
another country they're asked to shut up
so much so that they behave like they've
disappeared from the face of earth
because they they can't do any better so
I mean I should have been prepared but
yet I thought and thought this law and
this law and this law because my
question today exactly I mean it just
proves my point even better then why am
I asked this question in modern India
weren't we supposed to be the country
that never asked this question why
should I ask you what your religion is I
should be asking you that you know our
work related things and you know
this was never the India that we lived
in this was never the levels to which
politics dropped down to which
politicians drop down that I T cells are
being a you know so much dope so much
money has been put into that that the
same money could have been used
somewhere else I mean he's trying to
tell me that are you gonna sit here in
denial and say that oh nothing like that
is happening really that's not how it
works
so that is why somebody needed to just
get up go out there and I have been such
a private person
I have ferociously guarded my personal
life always my wedding ceremony had not
more than 50 people because that's the
way I like to live my life but if I have
now taken this I am gonna have to be
ready for all these things does it make
you feel vulnerable extremely because it
is not only me it concerns my husband it
concerns his wonderful parents and let
alone um you know they never even
suggested or asked me later don't force
me or anything to convert or two but
this Islamophobia then they are just
going on denying it it is in your face
why are you trying to what are you
trying to prove and why should I be
answerable about my religion and about
how I follow it I know more about
Hinduism didn't a lot of them so but the
question is why should I prove it to you
who has given you the right to ask me
that question
and you think religion should be your
proper choice and a private choice
absolutely because it's written in our
Constitution
among the other three things religion
and how you want to follow it is your
it's your basic right it's your basic
yeah freedom it's gonna be tough isn't
it going ahead extremely it's always
tough with people who have strong
ideologies if you don't keep on
constantly changing colors in words then
it is going to be tough I mean I used to
talk about strong ideology and in my you
know some of the research that came up
did you campaign for we know today of
the BJP a few years I did not carry
assembly lecture I didn't can't be the
friend he has been friends since many
years
he's from the region that I hail from
Konkan and also he was one of the many
people who was kind enough to warn me in
a very friendly manner against fighting
this election from this constituency
you're no longer friends no no I am very
much I like I said hey I on a personal
level I'm nothing against anybody
campaign for the BJP and I only went for
Vinod Gees one Sabha because I'm from
Concord side and he had said that there
are a lot of Konkani people here and
there was a promise I'm so happy that
you brought up this point because there
was a also a promise among zillion
others that to take a bus SD bus service
to take the train from here to Concord
because there are so many people from
that region who are extremely
hard-working low-income strata people
and they don't have a proper transport
system to go to their native place and
they have those many days of holidays
alone and that was what was promised and
that those are the subjects extremely
close to my heart
so I just went on a person-to-person and
level and now that you mentioned it let
me also tell you that I also very big
heartedly
on a charitable basis went all the way
to Delhi in my very very busy schedule
in acting 2014 and attended one of the
functions that their help for their beti
bachao movie yeah wouldn't you wouldn't
you do that you would because you are a
BT know so I did it as a BT but they
beautiful little speeches there on
YouTube and I'm very proud of but it was
headed by BJP but I was still under the
impression that okay I like I said I was
trying to be non-political
I was standing up for causes so I
thought beti bachao is obviously and I
am of a proud daughter who was given
extremely greater do not political
associations is what you're saying I
that as a matter of fact in you know I
was also asked to join the party because
of this I'm sure you and I don't want to
name the other lady who was with me on
that particular I'm sure the research
that gave you this particular
information will give you that
information as well that the other lady
who was with me on the dyers was also
asked not so well-known I would say as
me I was asked to join the party she did
and she bared lovely fruits of
while I didn't because I could never
join a party with which I have such
strong ideological differences you know
we need to talk about the Congress party
in Mumbai while a lot of people will
want to know you are excited about the
fact that you are contesting at the end
of the day people have to come to that
booth and absolutely press that indeed
button of the hand so how does that
happen given that we know that there's
infighting we know that Sanjay Nirupam
is not contesting Mumbai not which he
lost he's doing another seat do you feel
confident in what the party has to offer
in getting past that victory it has
become historical at the way people are
coming together to get this government
and party out so what has been happening
is there have been all these different
kinds of small and big organizations and
you know Institute's and you know groups
that that support various causes which
have come to on their own to me and said
that we lend you our support and that I
think pretty much is happening all over
Bombay and all over India I would think
because it is historical that people are
saying that we what anybody else but we
want these people out we are not going
to be told how we are supposed to live
what we are supposed to eat you know the
next they'll be telling us which other
days that we have to attend a certain
thing or not so that is where it has
come to so it is saying that the fact
that the Congress party in Mumbai seems
to be disunited or low on morale that is
not something that is going to come in
handy at all time is not absolutely not
because I know the kind of people I have
met a group called
the Friends of democracy the day before
yesterday they're a non political party
Sanjay Nirupam not contesting from
Mumbai that's a question you should be
asking him or the party seniors but so
Friends of democracy have approached me
this Marathi a kicker and approached me
trade unions have approached me some
others say of other people have
approached me so there are all these
people who are against these basic
things which are killing our
the the the secular fabric of our
country and which party doesn't have a
few whatever's up that pre you know
election etc I don't think that affects
the larger picture so long as the
candidates are out there and doing their
job and I think they are all doing it
brilliantly well so what is the
candidates job given that this is
something new to you and you're doing it
stays like I think different things for
different people for me right now it is
definitely about connecting to my people
so it's just about telling them that I'm
not here as your as the actress or melih
and here as your friend as your you know
as your representative and that's
honestly what we like to call in the
long run to be a representative of of
theirs in on a bigger platform whatever
that platform they become you know
Govinda was the MP from this region and
he did not do very well in terms of his
looks about attendance was very low and
there was also there were also reports
that people could not meet him when he
was in the constituency and after that
one term he did not continue I don't
want to get ahead of ourselves
of course you hope to win and we wish
you good luck but once you're in
Parliament let us say you are in
Parliament do you think that people have
people will have expectations which may
be difficult for an actor to meet given
that we have just given you go in there
alas my idea it is going to be very
difficult not because of the actor that
I am it is going to be very difficult
because of the lot of no activity that
has happened on lots of projects and
issues and you challenges so it's going
to be literally starting from below a
scratch so that is going to be a bigger
challenge than anything else and as to
attendance and accessibility and all
these things what I'm trying to come to
that don't you think that even I would
have just thought that oh I just have to
go wave my hand smile and ask for words
and just sit there and relax that's not
what I'm doing
my voice is already gone and I have 26
more days to pull on
so I'm that's happening because I'm
going out there
I'm actually sticking my neck out there
because I want them to feel that I'm
there for them and they will get that
message from me trust me people never
miss an honesty coming from a completely
non film background you know going
through my battles and struggles and
everything I know I'm not comparing
don't get me wrong not comparing films
to politics is no way I'm just comparing
the struggle I'm just comparing an
honesty and here my honesty is also
along with my integrity integrity of my
thoughts and towards my Nations that's
where we are talking irrespective of the
outcome do BC you continue in Polish
absolutely whether or not you become an
MP absolutely no absolutely are you
enjoy and I think I think if I if I
don't win it's gonna be more difficult
for them because I'm not gonna sit quiet
and say okay be all Gabby cocoon I am
still gonna raise voice that's gonna be
even worse it's rather they put me in
that chair and expect me to work harder
and get the results out ramela you know
what is interesting to a lot of people
is how you used to look in your movies
yeah and how you were dressed by Manish
Malhotra and are you ready Manish
Malhotra time are you kidding me it is
like one of the simplest possibly these
Footwear that I'm wearing is something
about in Borivali station outside that
on the road to yesterday and because my
my chakra tore off in one of my walks
amongst the people so I had to literally
stop and buy another Chapel on the
roadside so um you know I always believe
that it's it's clothes don't make a
purse of course it's other way around
and there it is fashion and whether it
is tying people don't sometimes get it
so therefore if you don't chase it and
if you let that reflect in your
personality in that would be more
interesting to see that thing that is
pretty brief enjoying the new look it's
more comfortable for one straw so one is
not varying like extremely thin chiffon
saris in getting frozen in the Alps and
still singing and looking beautiful and
entertaining people so that's good if
instead one is in cotton and in some
terrible heat and
amongst people what everybody noticed
Vasari and the bindi bindi I am NOT
putting will be when you go to play
since I am a Hindu and in our religion
people do welcome you with a traditional
Aarti the ladies put it on my head and
then it is very rude to wipe it out
therefore it's there because it's their
love of Allah you've got great gumption
I wish you a great deal of luck whatever
the outcome you're out there standing up
to be counted so that's wonderful it'll
be new energy in Indian politics in the
Congress party in Mumbai for sure so
good luck but you can leave only when
you say you know give us a piece of
music or a song that you can play on a
loop I'm a big fan of hindi songs so and
I know a lot of them is there one that
comes to mind now as well as I would
have sung it otherwise those voices tell
us the name and know a little singing
love I still sing it

another election news Congress president
Rahul Gandhi decided he will also
contest from Whynot Lok Sabha
constituency in Kerala besides his usual
MIT why what suddenly happened is he
afraid of losing from MIT let's find out
joining us now his alleged congress
spokesperson from Kerala Shami true Wow
mr. Tharoor I absolutely appreciate the
stratifying congenial and harmonious
confabulation of mere medians cohorts
and consultants that you have so
buoyantly gathered here to acquaint
yourselves with my consultation what was
that English
no Malayalam the way it was taught to me
when I was in the diplomatic services
and the United Nations
you're saying this speak like that in
the UN diplomatic services not just the
UN diplomatic services all diplomatic
services why so that no one can
understand what you're saying
just vaguely based on our show format
excellent okay let's talk about Rahul
Gandhi and his plan to run from a
meeting as well as why not in Kerala
simultaneously you see as per the
Constitution he's well within his
natural rights to indulge in bedwetting
bedwetting
sorry did I say bedwetting I meant
spread betting under Section 53 of the
representation of people Act 1951 a
person is allowed to contest polls from
a maximum of two seats some candidates
if they don't lose weight may even need
two seeds but then is Rahul Gandhi
running scared in MIT and hence also
wanting to stand from why not in Kerala
to put it simply certain informal
discussions took place involving a full
and frank exchange affairs out of which
there arose a series of suggestions
which on examination proved to indicate
certain promising lines of action which
if succinctly implement
might if the climate were right have a
reasonable probability of leading
rightly or wrongly to a mutually
satisfactory resolution what the hell
does that mean it means we looked at
options that's the one route Gandhi we
know maybe yes or no I would not
consider Rahul Gandhi as a Latino Cheney
hilly purification as useless everyone
is a useless why can't it just say
useless because if I were to the new
journalists would unleash an exasperated
farrago of distort Asians
misrepresentations and outright lies and
turn into unprincipled showman
masquerading as journalists then in
simple English is Rahul Gandhi also
standing from why not in Kerala because
he's afraid of Smithey irani well he is
not afraid of split irani but there is a
potential hypothesis that there may be
some sort of abhorrence recreant see
this composure and pushing enmity about
encountering the lady candidate in a row
full rancorous and indignant acrimonious
confrontation which means owl is dead if
I don't Revere honey I did not say this
don't put words in my mouth but it is
plausible presumable and presumptive mr.
Tyronne mr. Tharoor the center of all
the places in the world wise round and
he chosen why not kerala explain that
the answer is in the question itself
meaning after all why not why not why
not why not why not why not why not why
not it's even called why not you tell me
why not why not why not in Kerala in his
over Elam why not
stuff to answer these questions why not
why not why not why not you know we
should take this and sell it to namo TV
I think we could make a killing on this
one why not
the last why not for me all right let's
take a break coming back lots more on
the election that isn't I mean why not
back and why not watch this show I'm
sorry I want to get the why not out of
my system it's a normal problem all of
you mari that we all have
yeah as television journalist so hard
wax statue it should be unveiled at
Madame Tussaud what you just saw was the
actual current you are not the wax
statue now the unveiling will be done

Israel's national security advisors lost
classified documents related to weapon
deals with India well they were returned

Tel Aviv Oh waiter ladies in general
repeat that a waiter see Israelis are
just like Indians they hate dipping hand
over classified security documents
rather than cashed it take this just
take the files get out kill the gag why
honestly I apologize for everything in
the meantime we spoke to our friends at
I am UN a group of young dynamic
individuals who will soon run the
country from what I gather their
thoughts their ideas their aspiration
and the topics that are dear to their
heart the biggest one being reservation
but there's an irony we went to shoot at
kala gota outside somewhere in South
Mumbai outside is a set of steps there
and the policeman asked me a shooting
K'Ehleyr do you have a reservation
reservation would IIM UN
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
up that time I got that's the question
we've been asking everybody when we love
no time I go okay that drama is all
wrong in Hindi and English but that's
not the point because my student days
are over but today we have got young
people from all across this South Mumbai
area will get into a big topic the topic
for today which is how the hell do you
know what it leaked it leaked they
weren't supposed to know all right so
it's all about reservation we've got two
captains now let's set it up properly
captain I am the captain you're the
captain yeah the only male there's
reservation for males and your name is
Nishant nahshon nahshon is taking aim
against - what the hell the women who
can't be captains we should start with a
new form of general reservation that we
should get into immediately so who's for
reservation via for reservation so nice
on boolean I suppose that reservation in
a particular manner is good also because
for people like me who do not like
studies we just can go and give our
exams and you'll be like bro I got in
this is college yessum bro I got into
this college is the way you prove you've
got your reservation under control what
the hell are you talking about
even the unconvinced nation you're no
longer the cap and Sacky my then you
should become captain yeah you seem to
be very proactive here and what is your
view on is important because that helps
the weaker sections of the you repeat
the question with the part of the
question you know the person doesn't
know I remember doing this in many of my
language papers you rewrite the question
only of you know you don't know what
you're saying no but come on there are
disadvantaged communities there are
people who don't get a chance in life
they don't have your privileged
background they don't have your fancy
clothes how do they get into these help
colleges exactly so they need some push
from the government side and from the
countryside to reach where they want to
reach so philosophy you're not against
you understand it is not a level playing
ground yeah and some people have to be
held yes yes like when you're very short
person you wear heels
so you're saying let's understand
philosophy philosophically big word
it's not a bad idea level the playing
ground reservation is something that
needs to be taken care of it utmost
importance because I feel um
reservation is something that creates
biasness and students for example like
even if I worked very hard to get into a
great College in Mumbai but just because
I don't have that one caste certificate
which should get me in and that's like
what is this why is this happening with
he's acting it out mission you see this
captain is he's acting on the whole
performance make sure that reservation
does not affect students were actually
hard-working and need to get into that
college to make Acharya against you
wanna sing the same thing you're not
against the idea what you're saying that
the system has just been used basically
oh I wasn't paying attention I just made
that up I feel you still feeling I am
against the fact that reservations are
being made reservations are being given
on the basis of caste because I feel
reservation should be given only on the
basis of merit because if you have the
merit and if you have the countess
married again you see the same thing we
all sing the process is a problem people
abusing the process right not just the
process but they're just taking it for
granted because just because you have
that one caste certificate you can we
should get to caste certificates sorry
only one but that is something that you
shouldn't use in the wrong way Manas is
I don't know gimmick lap one of those
fantastic to me he's like the young or
even casey wall lot of confidence a lot
of eggs but I couldn't understand I
couldn't understand
ah yes you was in something so basically
right now reservation is so important
has become so important that I rather
keep my caste certificate in my locker
I've been keeping my jewelry inside the
locker why do you have jewelry in your
locker at 17 18 19 because I have to
save for my future
are you also with need of money I'm not
looting people but but even getting into
normal colleges I'm told no I got into
college in 89 or something so many years
have passed and I got into st. Xavier's
College dad was an old boy for effort
like this I think in 68% first list I
couldn't believe my luck so I was really
happy and was so easy and my tennis it
have any stress but I've heard that for
the last four or five years the parents
are going berserk standing in lines in
the big cities because they're only four
five college everybody want to get once
you get into and there's no chance for
89 90
93 I'll get those marks and not get into
college exactly exactly my point
reservation is not only based on cost
now it's based on languages as well you
know like for example Metis by has good
yukata and is in Dakota so why are you
discriminating the students it's a
community endorsing each community is
looking out of their own well that was
the idea when they put up the colleges
to help their own community and then
give certain seats to others so in a
sense that was also reservation but that
is gone right like we have moved or we
are in or 2019 where you guys so what
you're saying is just crap this whole
reservation you don't have any time for
it you're saying that's only merit
whether you're poor rich whether you're
disenfranchised or from interiors or
from the big city you're saying level
just level it up yeah bring equality why
you like discriminating it 1b is saw on
basis of economic but you know I have no
power to answer this question now you
have to talk to people in power in
government like Manas who fails
everything but let this I talk a little
bit nobody is talking I would say that
sitting in South Bombay it is easy to
say from being a well being family that
we don't need reservation but if we go
to the rural areas remote areas of the
country we find people who don't even
have the basic sanitation facilities
basic necessities so to uplift them they
are actually deprived and for them the
people from the interior that's where
the problem is arising so that's why
they are having a problem because you're
saying yes they don't have the kind of
background you are equality equality
also means equal opportunities but they
are extremely depressed so we need to
make some circumstances for them so that
they are able that's what the whole idea
is reservation is that only okay let's
get other voices quickly come on quick
quick points now about because people go
mad you know that they burn each other
and they if they hot and kale I mean it
goes to a level which is beyond our
control
yeah I think that are already uplifted
cause people we are getting more and
more privileges which should be stopped
like to some extent you are already
uplifted then people who are actually
economically weaker we should have
like aha we should give them deserve a
reservation your sin should go through
lots of different processes we should
consider a factor like for vegetarians
for non vegetarians for people who eat
only garlic and onions but without
garlic and onions for people who use
three toppings on pizza I'm getting so
much how many people who we give
reservation to everyone will say I have
a problem but what about films when is
the last Holi Bollywood actor who's come
from an under privileged background
who's done really well in is a superstar
we don't have reservation in Bollywood
we have nepotism in very good very well
put both of your very intelligent you're
sacked
these girls are far more in the front
here and they're understanding this
whole thing better as we rapid let's
understand this position we're making
light of reservation is this huge thing
elephant in the room some savings nobody
wants to discuss but it hurts and hits
everybody is it good or bad for society
let's once again Allyson is on steam who
says that we need reservation for a
unbalanced society like India I feel
like the people from the open category
will just use reservation as an excuse
so they'd be like because of reservation
they won't score well but they'll put it
on the resort students that he got in
but I didn't but in the first place you
must have not studied well so you cannot
see that so you know seeing human nature
being what it is no matter what you do
people take advantage of the situation
all these students that have kind of a
reservation
ah although we think that one caste
certificate helps them I think even they
have they have so much competition
amongst themselves because they are
larger number in our country especially
other issues also have to face
competition amongst this fear and only
then can they availing but you all know
making very strong points these guys
haven't talked very quickly
I am completely against reservations
because I'll share an incident yes I got
93 percent in my boards and I didn't
tend okay so and my friend she just got
for sale
three four percent but we both ended up
in the same college just because if Haas
in the corner so uh your point a doobie
is well-made which is if you're going to
take the reservation that's fine rule
make fun of the non-reservation person
don't go in their face and flaunt it is
they do yeah I'm watching friends what
are you doing you're studying yeah
because she got 54 and you got 93 and
you landed in the same spot this boy is
not spoken yeah so I feel that
reservation should not be valid for
generations like it is much more
intelligent I feel the points are so
well made except for you you can decide
Oh multiple generations should not get
the benefit of her caste reservation it
it should be tilting at 100 yeah then
obviously the dice again should be the
name is difficult for me but you are
fantastic you're a great mind I see a
great future for you and India but it's
reservation it's going to stay there
those who are for theirs those those who
are against who can decide we leave you
with the happy pictures of both sides
shouting each at each other about
reservation so we can understand their
feelings and their emotion and for Bo
let's leave you with my amana send me a
picture of two people who believe we can
make India proud one day article 377 is
far behind us it's a free country for
everyone see every community has their
own issues whether it's on age race cars
community whatever the hell gender
that's not the point the point is
everyone has their own Lobby their own
problems their own agenda okay
reservation is for you guys but for us
aging TV anchors it's preservation
reservation you think this black hedges
becomes black on its own
think about that preservation we'll see
you soon

it becomes but lover and much Patel or
MPN comfort love have family
Emma's Fidel but his family gimmick
attack holiday
the August reward has erupted once again
with just six days to go for polling to
kick off in the first phase of the
elections Prime Minister Narendra Modi
for the first time has named Emmett
Patel saying he is AP as mentioned in
the Enforcement Directorate chargesheet
he also added that everyone knows who F
a.m. that his family is saying that
Rochelle has exposed the role of the
Gandhi's finance minister Arun Jaitley
demanded Rahul Gandhi's answer on the
Enforcement Directorate charge sheet the
Congress has dismissed the charges
saying the IDI is no more than an
election tool of the present regime
however michele has told a court that he
has not given the Enforcement
Directorate any names adding that a free
and fair trial is being hampered the
August reward is once again at the
center stage of the entire election
campaign will the rain remove these
anti-corruption offensive against the
Gandhi is once again give the BJP the
edge in the polls let's listen in to
what the prime minister said helicopter
go to allocate the Lala a gin logo KO
gusta Nikki bata he had a say ich APA EP
are doosra a PM have him KP come MATLAB
a hospital or a PM come MATLAB help
Emily after a hospital Ghanim soon Anna
John Tirana Kamath Patel but his family
Kennecott hang up what I tell ya
helicopter key the logic is neck high
and Ahmad Patel has tweeted and I am
quoting him now baseless accusations
being leveled against me as it is
election season the truth can never be
hidden Edie has become an important part
of the NDA but such tactics will not
work the watchman is the thief
let me bring in Ashish maraschino Ashish
he tracks Edie and the entire
investigation he's tracking that
story very closely actually just put
this in context did Christian Michelle
actually named EP and if he hasn't as he
is claiming in the court then why does
the IDI cha sheet actually talk about ap
and the family well in fact you know the
one has to understand the fact Maria
that the charge sheet has been filed
with some evidence the evidence usually
in the case of Prevention of Money
Laundering Act is a PMLA statement given
by one by the accused now here the
accused is Christian Michele
so to my understanding because we only
have a copy of the chart sheet which is
around 73 pages but then it is backed by
a voluminous data which has been
submitted with the court now the
voluminous data also has statements of
Christian mission so in all likelihood
we are expecting because sources an
enforcement directorate confirmed that
he has named aps Ameth patil so we I am
expecting that you know at least the
PMLA statement would say so but if you
see what Christian michelle has said in
fact if you remember I interviewed him
long back and he said that he's being
pressurized to name a few people
especially a P as in a marital and
family as in Gandhi family to remember
the interview that I did in in Dubai and
now here again he comes out and gives a
application in the court the same quote
where the charge sheet has been
submitted the PMLA quote in the quote of
our will judge Arvind Kumar and he says
that I have not named anyone
so who's speaking the light so that is
what the big question is now here
tomorrow there the court is going to
take cognizance and in all likelihood is
going to issue some notices so tomorrow
we can expect at least a reply from the
Enforcement Directorate in this matter
as well but as elections are not very
far off so the discharges are actually
you know discharged it has actually
become you know you can say you know our
election pot by election potboiler so
ultimately one has to understand the
fact that you know until and unless the
Enforcement Directorate also comes out
with something which actually says that
this is what the statement is this is
where you know he has named a month
Patel you know and then his lies can
actually be nailed but ultimately yeah
tell me what exactly has Christian
Michele told the court well in fact he's
very clearly you know Innes tin
application he said that there are
certain reports in the media that the
charge sheet says that I have named a P
as in hamath Patil and Fama's in family
which is the Gandhi family
so here the Christian mission Michele
says that you know in a statement in his
application before the court that he has
not named anyone and it is actually a
lie that what the Enforcement
Directorate is saying so here obviously
you know both the Enforcement
Directorate and Christian Michele are
against each other in the court that you
know he's in the custody he is in tihar
jail as of now but yes if a statement
has to be believed then obviously it
becomes embarrassment for me directly
okay ashish thank you so much we hope
we'll keep coming back to you as you
track that story closely let me bring in
the guests this evening but the crit pan
is the strategic affairs analyst
tracking the story for long to hinson ah
is the leader of the BJP train Sina pure
politics that's being played here ever
as is being claimed by the accused
Christian Michele that he is not named
aap then why is it that the Prime
Minister is saying that AP stands for a
potato
well you know the chargesheet in the
other person he has clearly mentioned
that in the documents which were
recovered by the Swiss police from the
house of the mother of Keio has came in
Lugano Switzerland it carried reference
to these three people you know these it
carried these three initials and this
this is the only thing could operated by
Christian mission later so it is clearly
based on oral and the documentary
evidence now Christian mission can open
or go back on his word because he you
know at some point of time he has
enjoyed the protection of the previous
government which he does not enjoy at
this point of time but there is one
interestingly in this case the truth has
been complete
the muddled with lot of these
accusations rhetoric that is happening
do you think it's taken center stage
also because it's election time and
anti-corruption is a strong plank of the
Modi government yes Maria there is no
doubt that there was corruption in this
case I will I will get into that later
but if you look at you know making
acquisitions you know in an election
time cannot be a monopoly of the
Congress or opposition parties only
because we have discussed several times
in the Rafah issue there has been a lot
of baseless allegations which were made
Supreme Court in spite of the fact that
Supreme Court dismissed it in spite of
the fact that CAG came out with the
report stating that it was 2.8 percent
cheaper so you know this is an election
time and you know there will be counter
radication now look at if you look at
what happened in the augustawestland
case there were two contenders one was
the AgustaWestland helicopter the other
was the Koski s-92
I'll tell you where the corruption
happened there was a letter which was
written by Christian Michele first of
all this is not a deal which was handled
by defense ministry it was handled by
PMO this was not a defence deal now that
the other contender which was sikorsky's
helicopter it was 80 percent cheaper
than that of AgustaWestland commercial
bid but what Christian Michele did
through manipulation and of course that
manipulation happened with all the
people involved in the government that
time they rejected Sikorsky helicopter
in the trial itself so that it's
commercial bid is not open now what was
a commercial bid for Sikorsky for 12
valley copters 2,228 crore and that of
Augusta was three thousand nine hundred
sixty-six floor 80% more August's was
secondly Sikorsky helicopter which was
rejected that time has now been you know
chosen by US president to be used by
marine one for u.s. presidents fleet so
there is a corruption now when it comes
to these allegations this is an election
time we have seen so many times all
Gandhi making baseless allegations we
know that there are 90 odd companies
involved in Rafah offset he keeps on
taking one company's name so you know
that cannot be a monopoly of the
Congress there will be allegations of
both
just a bit Maya
go ahead particulate yeah there is
another angle to it there is another
angle to wait the other person who was
you know extradited from Dubai Rajiv
Saxena right he has turned an approver
in this case so we have to see whether
there was any statement by him also to
corroborate what has been written by
Enforcement Directorate they may not be
depending entirely on Christian mission
alone this time
so the approver has a role in it okay
okay we are hoping to be joined by a
congress spokesperson in just a bit but
you know Tajin sana here is a
particulate who has tracked you know
defense ministry and defense deals very
very closely he says that there is
corruption here and an election time
it's free fall just about every question
every issue being can be raised but I'm
just trying to make the distinction of
you know the fact and and the the
difference between what is fact and
fiction here I am NOT saying that what
the Prime Minister is saying fiction is
fiction but a pede Nessus and and how do
you look at it then what Ameth patellar
said Amit Patel says that the watchman
is a thief and that the IDI has become
an important part of the ND and the
truth can never be hidden you know a few
moments ago why goldenseal gets up
during the elections let me make it very
clear that the specialty the Congress is
the 24 by 7 365 days
brokerage firm it's only in front of the
country that they pretend to be a
political party they are a you know
power out and out power brokers they are
carrying the carry of all kinds of
underhand brokerage deal so I don't
think you know this particularly as my
producer to connect the congress
spokesperson on the phone now

with elections that's all I can tell you
because these are these things I mean

story and I would like to thank my
guests on that note thank you so much

so for everything going wrong you blame
the Congress party so lemon Mohammed is
now back is joining us a Salim on
Mohammed there's a question that
particular has for you that you know
these you know what you have built
around a fall deal is essentially
fiction and when it comes to
AgustaWestland there is truth in this
and hence prime minister is right and
doing politics over it know who has who
has cancelled august d it is a congress
party who has initiated the cbi inquiry
it was the congress party who has
offered to have a jpc when Congress was
in power it was Congress party and BJP
refused who has initiated the process of
burning of augustawestland or the parent
company Finmeccanica it was the Congress
party it was finally banned in July or
August 2014 after 3-4 months of Modiji
coming to power but what Modi ji did
what BJP did they have tried to you know
allowed they have actually allowed
August of Finmeccanica to participate in
making India and other programs of the
country in unto to bid for defending all
the company and and will they will the
answer will they answer that on 8th of
January 2018 an Italian appeal court
acquitted mr. or see former chief
executive and mr. Bruno former head of
helicopter unit from any wrongdoing in
sale of 12 helicopters when the
government was a civil party for the
damage in September 2000 Mario Mario
just one sentence on seven
17 September 2018 a higher court in
Milan Italy affirmed the order and they
said that no graft or wrongdoing by an
Indian official Modi government was a
party in the case and lost Modi
government has chosen not to file an
appeal aria so where does the Modi
government stand
yeah yeah very interestingly is faith in
the faith in the you are can you please
can you please not use those words he is
a journalist who understands defense
much better than both of us
glad I thought anybody will telling me
he please Suleiman let him speak please
and let's be fair I have not said that
not use those words that you have you I
have not said no no that's what it out
you said that's not more in have you
quickly Supreme Court verdict Andhra
valleys one is
so Maria the very simple thing yes it is
whatever the course in India will decide
the Government of India will abide by
that okay that the chargesheet can
happen here
the case will happen here we are not
subject to the Italian courts secondly
the king ordered the deal was cancelled
after the Italian courts initiated into
education but nothing to do with
Congress government third by that time
the bribes have already been taken it
does not matter then when that bill gets
concluded or not fourth can they answer
why was why was the helicopter which was
selected by the US president was cancer
during ups time we'd be will believe in
the Indian so much thank you no thank
you so much thank you so much and
getting you a CNN news 18 exclusive now
Weiss our Congress chief Jung unread D
perhaps most politically significant
interview yet citing Andhra Pradesh
special status as a stop priority Jagan
moon Reddy has made it clear that he
will only back the party which will
fight for the state's special status at
the center
he has also hinted at a possible
alliance with the Congress by saying
that he has no grievance against Rahul
Gandhi listening
can there be new rules of engagement
with the second generation of Congress
leaders we are seeing Rahul Gandhi in
command and also Priyanka Gandhi well as
if not I mean I'd be very candid to say
that I don't have any vengeance or any
grievance against anybody I believe in
God and I do read Bible everyday and I
have a lot of faith in God and I
strongly believe that vengeance is not
mine we just forgot to decide and I have
forgiven them in my heart as far as I'm
concerned my state is priority it's
verse I'm concerned special category
status is priority
mr.reddy this also means that you have
to be on the right side of the center in
case if you have water to power who will
that be will you be comfortable dealing
with Narendra Modi or doing business
with the Congress party suppose we are
concerned we do not trust any of them
there's a miss there's an element of
mistress as soon as our state is
concerned both of them have cheated our
state both of them are betrayed our
state now coming to the Congress part
Congress against our wishes against the
majority of the wishes broke our state
then they did not incorporate this
demand of special category status or
this promise of special category status
into the AP reorganization Act had they
incorporated this promise of special
category state special category status
into the act then we could have gone to
the Supreme Court knocked their door

AS5RuOHZvjE,Election Epicentre: Mamata Banerjee Hits Out At PM Modi With An &#39;Expiry Prime Minister&#39; Jibe,The Lok Sabha Elections are coming soon with a number issues and obstacles. While PM Modi hit out at Mamata Banerjee in his ...,2019-04-03T15:30:01Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AS5RuOHZvjE/hqdefault.jpg,"to begin and the BJP and the Congress
are carpet-bombing the election
battlefield with the campaign trail the
2019 elections and the war is continuing
to escalate between Rahul economy strike
through the new income guarantee scheme
versus Narendra Modi's nationalism
narrative Kashmir has also sparked a
major political draw on one side the BJP
is promised to abrogate article 35 a has
pushed the Kashmiri parties that is the
National Conference and the PDP warning
of a split between the state and the
country
meanwhile the Congress's manifesto
promised to ease off spa in Kashmir has
led the BJP to accuse the party of going
soft on terror the battle rages in the
critical states namely a three-cornered
fight in utter Pradesh which will decide
the 2019 victor quite literally and but
first we'll get you details of all the
state beginning with Bengal a direct
face-off between Prime Minister Narendra
Modi and Mamata Banerjee took place
there Prime Minister Modi in fact
launched a scathing attack against
Mamata Banerjee at his rally in
parade-ground in Kolkata calling her the
speed breaker of Vikas he slammed the
Bengal Chief Minister for questioning
the surgical strikes calling her a part
of the anti India Brigade he accused
Mamata and her nephew Abhishek Banerjee
of trying to loot the state adding that
the BJP will defeat the bomb and gun
culture Mamata Banerjee reacted swiftly
to Prime Minister Modi calling him the
expiry Prime Minister she called Moody's
weak-ass record file to and challenged
the PM to get a single word in Bengal
let's listen in to the reaction that
came from Mamata Banerjee and what the
Prime Minister actually said is Leopold
Jogi on Akira genetics I mean the old
rahi hai Mangal
Sandra hi
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
so from apathy joy in utter Pradesh
there is a new Baba teacher combination
also in the state of West Bengal
interesting but chaga though let me
begin with you by asking this question
we had seen Rahul Gandhi hit at Mamata
Banerjee's saying that her miss
governance is almost similar to Narendra
Modi and that she also gives long harsh
and long speeches but when it comes to
deliverables she has failed
just as Narendra Modi has at that time
we did not hear from any of the TMC
leaders mama da manha geum's herself did
not react even if the junior rank of you
know a party men did what are the Mamata
Banerjee so much today that she came out
all guns blazing against the Prime
Minister well there are a lot of
political compulsions that are working
at at all sides Maria the as far as
Rahul Gandhi is concerned you know she
of course did criticize Mamata Banerjee
in in his Malda rally that happened last
week moment of energy did not respond to
it called you know were a whole Gandhi a
young kid and and ignored you know what
Rahul Gandhi had to say saying that you
know she would not respond to what a
young kid is talking about her of course
there we do know
that as far as the mahogany Bunton is
concerned we do know that as far as you
know some kind of a post electoral
arrangement with the Congress is
concerned that is very much still on the
cards on the basis of a common minimum
program if you know Congress does well
and if the other regional parties does
well and if they manage to you know
stage you know a better result compared
to the BJP then those options have to be
kept open so that's a political
compulsion that motive energy is acting
on Rahul Gandhi is of course acting on
another political compulsion that the
Congress has decided to go solo in
Bengal and has not you know gone into
any kind of a gut Banton here in in
Bengal and since Trinamool Congress is
the ruling party it is incumbent on on
Rahul Gandhi to to criticize the the
ruling dispensation here in Bengal so
these are all political compulsions the
other point that I wanted to talk about
Marya really is you know today Narendra
Modi had two rallies in in Bengal one in
Chile green North Bengal that was the
first one and the second of course at
the brigade parade ground here in
Kolkata and the turnout at the Kolkata
rally at the brigade parade-ground rally
was pretty impressive I must tell you I
mean it's it's easily one of the biggest
rallies that the the BJP has has managed
to put together in recent times and that
obviously had been a shot in the arm
not just for Narendra Modi not just for
some of the you know central leaders but
in fact all these state leaders over
here were ecstatic at the kind of
turnout that happened at the brigade
parade ground today but if you look a
carefully look at what not in Germany
had to see at the brigade parade ground
Rani you know I was a little surprised
because of the fact that it felt to me
that the Prime Minister wasn't exactly
scathing in his in his criticism about
you know mamta Banerjee and the
Trinamool Congress of course he he
mentioned about the the Borja thuja
combination here in in Bengal as well of
course he spoke about dynasty politics
of course he also referred to to to
criminal is a criminal ization of
politics etc etc but if you look at some
of the recent speech
of Mao of Narendra Modi in Bengal in the
recent past you would see that he would
he has been far more critical he has
been far more scathing - you know as far
as moment of energy is concerned
compared to what he had to say today in
fact if you if you you know look at
Narendra Modi's speech he was far more
critical about the Congress despite the
fact that Congress is not a major a lot
of time first of all first of all
anything can happen right and and of
course and of course true true true and
and that's the reason perhaps why you
know you know mom and and and Modi
perhaps was you know as far as the
Kolkata rally is concerned was trying to
address a national audience you know
rather than a regional Bengal specific
audience which is why the attack was far
more a pinpointed against the Congress
it was far more pinpointed on the on the
caustics of any Festo which is of course
the latest and greatest elaboration in
in terms of in terms of yes yes so
that's the real you know I think that
you know Modi focus more on the Congress
rather than on Mamata at least here in
Bengal very very interesting they're
shocked though you know the fact that
Prime Minister focused more on the
Congress party rather than Mamata
Banerjee's so post-poll as they say
rules of engagement and new parties can
join and you never know how never say
never in politics as they say thank you
so much for joining us so in Bengal it
was because speed-breaker
versus expiry Prime Minister as was used
by Mamata Banerjee shifting focus to
utter Pradesh a state that gives a TPMS
in the Lok Sabha and Sienna News 18 is
now trying to decode the Samajwadi Party
BSP campaign strategy for the first
phase of polls in western Uttar Pradesh
which kicks off in eight days while the
BJP is carpet-bombing the region with a
rally the opposition will hold its first
rally only on April 7th in saharan poor
sources in the BSP SP camp say the lines
has deliberately chosen to go slow with
the high decibel campaign to give the
BJP an opportunity to polarize the
elections they do not want the BJP to
polarize elections so since a SP BSP are
focused
door-to-door campaign through local
workers and leaders meanwhile bsp
supremum iowa t answered CNN user teens
question on why there is no campaigning
yet in eight seats of western uttar
pradesh go to polls on 11th that
includes our LD stronghold of buck birth
there are other constituency such as
merit noida all of them go to polls
rancho mishra is joining us live prawn
shoe here is my a--they telling a
reporter operation with who yes
certainly we are not worried we we are
just raising the question if SP b SP and
our LD the maja got bundle is taking it
easy in the first phase
yes that's right sim Iowa see what she's
saying I mean she is also accepting the
fact that yes we haven't been to West
yupi so far but we'll actually pick up
the entire campaign in days to come
but the question actually which myopathy
should have responded is why actually
she has been shy of going to Western
rupee so far today and the answer lies
in the demographic profile there in the
Western you pee all these seats which
names you are taking they are not in
strong words of the BJP in the sense
that it's not the seats like [ __ ] BJP
has been winning the safe right from 90s
like the case of luck no other 40s so
they have been flip-flopping either
between the BSP Samajwadi Party or the
BJP last time it was BJP which has taken
over all the seat reason big reason was
terminal polarization in the backdrop of
2013 was up another roids it's the same
reason why in actually shadow didn't
venture out to Kerala in the by polls
despite it being such a commission
relations in that time point in time his
strategy was that if a clinch goes day
in karana it might lead to some sort of
criminal polarization because Samajwadi
Party is generally identified to the
part being the party close to the
minorities that's the reason why my
Athene declares have chosen to hit the
campaign trail only in the last leg of
the campaigning for the first poll that
is one-seventh and campaigning will end
on 9th of even evening of the 9th of
April so this is one big reason and
whatever my Hatice is it's awkward
she'll not say openly that it's because
of this reason that they don't want BJP
to come really polarize but the fact
remains that all these constituency is
on an average of 25% of minorities yeah
siharan pure has 39% of Muslim vote
share business 41% of what share and it
these values will be held by the
Alliance we all know what will be the
natural calm of people or the supporters
would be merging out in these rallies
and BJP can actually have an opportunity
of a larger polarization as we have seen
in 2014's elections and then 2017 state
elections and that's the reason why the
opposition has kept its campaign
low-profile in that belt so that is the
indeed actual inner story of the
Alliance branch you before I let you go
in all how many rallies are the joint
rallies in which we will see all the
three Margit Bandhan players together
well Mara in phase one it's only going
to be one rally that would be held on
7th of April in in bourbon in siharan
for all these three leaders
Akhilesh my Latino of course Ajit Singh
also interestingly Congress too has not
venture invest you P they are also going
to hold series of rallies in fact three
or four rallies only on earth in the
first phase that is just a day before
when the campaign against and you will
see both Raul and Priyanka Gandhi in
action in all three all these free
rallies interesting thank you so much
francha Mishra for giving getting as the
latest as far as what the Pradesh is
concerned these constituency's that we
were discussing actually go to polls in
the first phase where in 2014 again the
the BJP had almost swept the entire
western European he just as most of the
state shifting focus now to German
Kashmir the political slugfest between
the valley Anita's and the BJP leaders
continues to escalate over the
constitutional validity of article 370
and article 35 a after the National
Conference leader Omar Abdullah said his
party will strive to restore the
autonomy of the state PDP chief memory
as dead the central government saying
that if the BJP abrogates article 35 a
and 370 the state will snap ties with
India she further says that the valley
will do everything to protect article
370 as it is a fight for their rights
remember a BJP chief Amit Shah said that
the party is committed to abrogating
article 35 a by 2020 tell us about a
mature we did he didn't mention that
they going booze article 35 a by 2020 I
think you should be prepared by 2020
German Kashmiri is not going to be part
of a country if the conditions on which
we have acceded to the country if they
are if the very conditions are removed
then they should be prepared for a
bigger fight and member maaske will be
in the forefront of that also four
separate prime minister for German to
speak
see if it happens I mean when shakes up
signed 1975 Accord he should have at
that point of time insisted on that
after their national conference a 2/3
majority for all these years
unfortunately they did nothing of the
sort today they are saying if they can
be happen why not you
you said that you're going to go phone
hog the national conference between
defending article 3 very much very much
I stick to that we will do everything to
define article 370 and we are together I
mean the whole slaw is joining us now
boasting you spoke to my form of tea and
also Omar Abdullah how much of this is
an issue on ground in terms of the
sentiments of people will they be voting
on these lines or is it an issue just
among the politicians no it's sort of
concern among the valley here especially
if not in Jammu because article 35
touches the skin of the people and
people are so much concerned because
they think that if it's written off so
it goes then floodgates are going to
open they would be change in demography
and this is the point that these
politicians are harping on whether it is
map album of tea or Omar Abdullah or
Farooq Abdullah they've been very
vociferous in the last week or so and in
fact now it's it's been getting shriller
and Schiller as we speak in that
interview with Babu boom of tea today
she did clearly say that if Union
government decides that they're going to
scrap article 35 then perhaps Jammu
Kashmir will also think whether they
going to go with the gum with the union
of India
so Kelly it's a threat and we've seen
similar kind of threats also coming from
Omar Abdullah Farooq Abdullah even
Sajjad known was considered to be an
ally of bgp he said that if you write
off article 35
that would be a grave sin the engineer
ashit another independent leader he's
also talked you know in in the same
fashion all in all you know one good
thing has happened about this is that
these politicians by virtue of raking
article 35 a have been able to touch
base with the constituency which they
were not few months back no politician
worth his salt would go say for example
in south Kashmir today we saw Mehbooba
Mufti rushing towards an ant nog in a
huge cavalcade now the rally is Omar as
well as mokuba Mufti or for that matter
Sajid on or Farooq Abdullah that the
rally one sees the expelling day by day
which means that you know article 35 a
in terms of electioneering is working
and it's working very fast so one is the
political aspect of it and two is also
the real concern that article 35 has I I
pointed out that you know the political
parties have been able to convey this
message that if article 35 a goes then
you know it will have disastrous effect
and they seem to be really conveying
that to the people and people are also
it seems you know getting convinced that
these politicians are the real saviors
of article 35 a and clearly these
politicians are also being helped by
this sentimental issue to gain ground
and also to touch base with the people
which as I said they have not been able
to do some four or five months back
okay so Mufti but you know all these
Valley parties including the Congress I
would say partially right now because
the their stand in the manifesto they
are speaking the same language they have
the similar stand the only party which
is against is that is that is the BJP
and I do not think that they have much
stake as far as the valley is concerned
Jammu is a different story altogether
so what exactly is the constituency
don't you think it could be divided
among all these three parties it will it
will certainly you know right now the
issue this time seems that Valley
politicians are against BJP and they got
a kind of you know
they were bolstered by the support from
Congress which yesterday released that
manifesto in order all the goody-goody
things said about Kashmir they talked
about having interlocutors from the
civil society who are going to
continuously engage with people of
German Kashmiri then they did say that
are we going to reduce the footprints of
soldiers especially in civilian areas if
not on the borders
in fact they talked about borders being
tightened further so that no
infiltration takes place and they did
also talk about deleting some of the
chapters of Article II of Armed Forces
Special Powers Act which is kind of seen
as a harassment here by the people
because people have been accusing really
the government of using excessive force
all in all I can tell you that there is
a competing politics that is taking
place at this juncture in the valley and
everyone seems to be happy and gaining
on the ground by by raking this
contentious issue whether that's thirty
five way or for that matter 370 and by
acting as a savior of these articles
clearly these political parties are
gaining ground and it seems that they
really going to pull out the electorate
which otherwise was very nascent to
these elections
all right Isla thank you so much for
joining us if you're not giving us that
perspective coming from the valley

okay my friends use in this weekend I
have grown one inch but not height
Congress president Rahul Gandhi a
besides from his traditional stronghold
of a mighty nu P will also contest from
Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency in Kerala
you asked me why what suddenly happened
is he afraid of losing from Almighty
joining us now is alleged congress
spokesperson from Kerala
Shami rule what a name sir I absolutely
appreciate the stratifying congenial and
harmonious confabulation of mere medians
cohorts and consultants that you have so
buoyantly gathered here to acquaint
yourselves with my consultation have
only one word what the hell what was
that was that English know Malayalam yes
the way it was taught to me when I was
in the diplomatic services and the
United Nations they speak like that in
the UN diplomatic services not just the
UN diplomatic services all diplomatic
services ah why so that no one can
understand what you're saying okay
interesting
but let's talk about Rahul Gandhi and
his plans to run from MIT as well as why
not in Kerala you see as per the
Constitution he's well within his
natural rights to indulge in bedwetting
oh I knew I can't play the tape again
bedwetting sorry did I say bedwetting
I meant spread betting spread betting
under Section 53 of the representation
of people Act 1951 a person is allowed
to contest polls from a maximum of two
seats some candidates if they don't lose
weight may even need two seeds
[Laughter]
but then it's round Gunny running scared
in MIT and hence wanting to also stand
from why not as a backup in Kerala to
put it simply certain informal
discussions took place involving a full
and frank exchange affairs out of which
there arose a series of suggestions
which on examination proved to indicate
certain promising lines of action which
if succinctly implemented might if the
climate were right have a reasonable
probability of leading rightly or
wrongly to a mutually satisfactory
resolution finished it means we looked
at options but put the hold on leave in
a medium is that the possibility I would
not consider Rahul Gandhi as a lottery
no Cheney Healey purification Japanese
as useless if you want to say useless
but didn't just say useless because if I
were to the new journalists would
unleash an exasperated farrago of
distort Asians misrepresentations and
outright lies and turn into unprincipled
show men masquerading as journalists we
are calling all journalists useless fair
enough now tell me in simple English sir
is wrong on the also standing from why
not in Kerala because he's afraid of
smithy Kabhi sass Bebo voting courtesy
irani well he is not afraid of splitty
irani but there is a potential
hypothesis that there may be some sort
of abhorrent recreant see this composure
and pushing intimately about
encountering the lady candidate in a row
full rancorous and indignant acrimonious
confrontation
how do you ever order from swiggy
difficult which means Rahul is terrified
of smithy Ronny I did not say this don't
put words in my mouth but it is
plausible presumable and presumptive a
mr. Tarrou of all the places in the
world why has rahul gandhi chosen kerala
and of all places why not the answer is
in the question itself sorry what after
all why not why not why not why not why
not why not why not it's even called why
not you tell me why not why not why not

this is reporters project where we
record how politics and policies affect
the common man in the Lok Sabha
elections of 2014 the Dalit vote was
critical empowering the BJP and arranger
Modi to victory five years later the
community says that it's feeling very
let down by the government a combination
of factors are at play the rising
incidents of atrocities policies that
they feel affect the rights granted by
reservation and a deep lingering
suspicion of the BJP s real intent or
commitment to Dalit welfare now on April
11th 8th constituency's of western Uttar
Pradesh will be voting these include
siharan pork Khurana Muzaffarnagar
pigeon or merit bug but Ghaziabad and
Gautam Buddh Nagar and this disaffection
of the Dalit community towards the BJP
is on sharp display here Arun in my
reports and she also tries to find out
why they're feeling this way
as you zip out of Delhi on these eight
lane highways and past noida in the
reformed ghaziabad you can be lulled
into believing that Western yupi is well
developed and prosperous but jostling

73 year old bamboo tree Davies home in
shibir poor village in Saharan Pole was
born down in May 2017 she was alone with
two infant grandchildren when tacos from
neighbouring villages allegedly
descended to attack her and her
neighbours nearly two years later she is
still waiting for the promise government
help to rebuild

house the soot on the doorframe bears
testimony to the horror thermal and his
son who was injured experienced when the
tacos were employed them on their farms
came to attack villagers say the
violence in May 2017 was a result of
long simmering tension the Dalit
villagers had objected to loud music
being played on Maharana Pratap G&T
leading to clashes yogurt equality the

you speak to Dalit voters invariably the
conversation includes the incident that
happened in shibir poor village this
temple of Guru Vedas and Baba Ambedkar

between the Dalit residents and
allegedly the upper caste opposed
echoes of shibito violence are heard in

the lack of jobs or unemployment is the

grievance these youths nurse is about
the Supreme Court order that weakened
the sc/st prevention of atrocities Act
even though the government has amended
that law to counter the supreme court

strikes me most in that story is how

they want good jobs that will help them

p.m. Modi's life was released last week
the film starring Vivek Oberoi but not
the hotel in the lead role is set to hit
the screens on April 5th ahead of the
2019 Lok Sabha elections talk about
timing it's a coincidence I spoke to the
lead actor and this is what he had to
say welcome to my happy smile I'm happy
because I have Vivek Oberoi to talk to
after a long time ultimately the most
popular person in entertainment we make
congratulations on the film are you
excited
I can read from your facial expression
that you're super excited now have you
met the PM don't want to say yes or no

so how was it in case you met it oh you
can tell me the rate you can tell me
very irritating you get it if you why
what what happened why the hugs why the
holes why the heart you mean he okay
okay what do you thing is you don't like
being hugged yeah I hate that I hate it
brother I swear I hate it too of course
nobody ever really hugs me so I don't
really know what it's like but
like by yoga so you must have really had
to get into character Vivek to play such
an iconic leader
I mean days and days of rehearsal
getting it right I trained for five
months five months is nothing
you should have trained for getting the
walk the wise and the mannerisms of the
prime minister right for years people
who spent 15 20 years I'm told he
himself spent 50 20 years so what is it
you trained for hanging from a chopper
with one hand yeah yeah that's not easy
to do that's really a tough thing but
this filming action in the movie is what
you're saying yes hmm
seriously you played the p.m. and it was
shown hanging from a helicopter it was
amazing

the other Prime Minister film The
Accidental prime minister yes how was
that horrible really it was very painful

Narendra Modi film yes you've told me
all the great things about your film

can say this what could have been better
anything missing anything that could
have been better
there's a lack of story I guess that's
okay
it's a Hindi film so not a big deal see
this film with the message is that the
point but at heart it's a how should I
say they see da maka entertainer popcorn
by service will see TMR kind of movie of
course it's movie for sure 101 percent
yes okay finally tell us about becoming
the prime minister himself the emotions
the conflict the body language the
relationships of speeches how are you

ask if me and serese Oberoi were in
class together I was older I was one
year above the razor breast boolean okay
let's do some film shoot technology
India this week became the fourth nation
in the world after United States China
and Russia to demonstrate anti-satellite
missiles capability by shooting down a
satellite our own satellite according to
reports the target was a decommissioned
Indian satellite our own satellite which
was eliminated within three minutes let
us go and meet the alleged scientists at
DRDO who makes these great things
possible he's a personal friend and is
talking to us exclusively after which
we'll talk to everybody else bonesaw
speak to us pleas for the missile was
developed indigenously by us yes well as
we hear that US China Russia
well they had taken several years to
develop this technology but India has
made history in the very first short yes
yes absolutely India has made history in
the first short all I can say is
congratulations but this is not the only
thing we have achieved in the first shot
not the only thing in India there are
many things we have achieved in the
first shot the first shot like what what
else have we achieved typhoid cholera
recently the monetization yes be a
bridge funny hahaha I've been saying the
scientists have sense of humor wrong
English but you know what I mean stop
undermining your effort so we are really
proud of you today very proud oh thank
you thank you really really in fact it
is unbelievable that you made the
distance into orbit so quickly the
missile hit its target flying in a low
Earth orbit after it travels per
distance of almost 300 kilometers from
Earth
within three minutes of its launch Wow
300 kilometers away from Earth and just
three minutes to reach low Earth orbit
yes otherwise it takes 30 hours to reach
Milan in orbit in Mumbai have you gone
that could have been destroyed also I
would really complain anyway your
mission is completed so what does it
mean exactly any nuclear or brutal
threat that may come from near or far
away near or far away no far away you
have demonstrated but what about any
brutal thread that may come from nearby

you know I feel like I should start by
asking you a Sherman um your new feature
no fathers in Kashmir
finally has a release date after a
considerable delay due to a protracted
battle with the censors not new for you
you've had run-ins with the censors at
least twice before during inshallah
football and inshallah crush me the
irony being of course that those films
received national awards despite the
fact that they didn't actually release
each time that you make a new film and
that you get into that conversation do
you go in with the hope that this board
will have a less jaundiced view no not
at all
it's one of the most hopeless situations
that I know in our country today that we
have a sense about to mediate between
ourselves and our audiences you know I
think the sense of what should be done
away with entirely or she should
restrict themselves to simply certifying
films and not use the scissor as wanting
Lee as they do the problem with
censorship regime is that it creates
fear hostility suspicion and all the
negativity that we have been seeing in
the aftermath Obama this is a direct
result of censorship
you know films don't create fear
censorship creates fear and this is
something that we have to understand you
know as a country what happens is that
when there is censorship applied only
one-sided view comes out and
demonization takes place alienation
takes place so our vision of Kashmir is
is somebody with a mask and a stone or
someone with a gun trying to do jihad
these are the two caricatures that we
are served yeah now in the absence of a
counter-narrative which perhaps says
that that kid with a stone goes to
school walks the streets has a family a
father perhaps so it doesn't exist
the minute you start giving that side of
the picture which is what my film tries
to do right and humanize the person with
a stone you start creating what is
called empathy and now what we have in
Kashmir today actually is a crisis of
compassion and this is a big problem you
know we are not compassionate
towards our fellow citizens in Kashmir
yet we would like them to be part of our
union and this is a big issue you know
how can you expect people that you
create caricatures out of in this manner
to be a part of your country if you
don't afford them the basic dignity and
respect and self-respect and
opportunities and choices that you have
been given in the rest of the country do
you know and censorship is stopping in
fact sense that this is a direct result
pull Varma I'm sorry to say this is the
direct result of censorship what
convinces a twenty-year-old to put
explosives in a car drive it into a
convoy you may understand who is that
kid
what kind of schooling did he have what
kind of family does he come from the
minute you start its unfolding those
backgrounds which is never served up to
us in our media and mainstream channels
or thanks to government propaganda as
being we've completely alienated from
that truth so this is what my film tries
to do and it tries to do it in a very
gentle tender light-hearted way you know
two 16 year rolls yeah
wandering about the hills falling in
love breaking each other's hearts and
the censor board comes down on it like a
ton of bricks like me and they don't
have the thing is I love this because
you know when I wrote the script of
course I knew I was going to face this
issue I had two films banned so I was
like yeah come on and I think you know
what I'm gonna write a movie about a kid
trying to find her father hmm right
and it's my challenge to the censor part
that come on babies bring it on
retract what are you gonna find
objection will about that and it took
them six months of scratching their
heads no not six that look about nine
months you know there's about a time
that it takes to deliver a child right
nine months of scratching their heads to
try and figure out what is it that they
actually found objectionable in that and
because it took nine months the only
thing that I can say is that they
couldn't find anything objectionable so
they resorted to delay tactics so we're
sitting at the other end of nine months
with the UN a certificate which is a
certificate we deserve and thanks to
FCAT we've actually caught it so that is
really performed well in this I must say
they have done
dooty they have done due diligence and
they have upheld the Constitution and
our rights and have spared me the agony
of going to court right which is great
right but really nine months sir en Xuan
the two who play key roles in this film
like I said this is the story of a
teenager of a British married teenager
who returns to her grandparents home in
Kashmir
and discovers the truth about her father
what sold you on this film the script
the script
Ashwin was very kind enough to you know
let me let me read the script and it's
it's really when I read the script so
firstly like you know I it was an
eye-opener for me because I I thought
again like the title says everybody
thinks they know Kashmir and you know
The Blob I also thought and you some
what something about Kashmir but when I
read this script it really made me
understand more and so therefore I got
very excited and very inspired because I
felt this is this is something that must
go out there sure and I was very very
keen to be a part of it for that reason
yeah with me it was a case of wanting to
work with him because I've seen little
terrorists yeah I've seen his previous
work and I'm a huge fan of his book and
having done because I've grown up on a
diet of stage I like paths which are not
going down the treaded part so when he
gracefully his team called me and shared
the script I loved reading four paths
and he said can you read and send it
because I wasn't convinced that I would
fit it because it was an Army Major
right and I look nothing like you know
what our British potential right so yes
I read it by God's grace he liked it and
then we started filming honestly the
script is sacrosanct right it's the
Bible the moment I read the script like
Sonia T said it sir it's your Bible and
this script is a story that needs to be
told for the simple reason that we all
have an impression of caution here
here's a filmmaker who knows the region
as well as probably anyone else in the
country who's in the film business and
it's dishing out okay in here where you
can actually smell the flavors and the
reality of
place so it was a complete no-brainer
for me too and also one side we said he
just let me loose very rarely do you
come across parts where he says just
have fun also because he's an actor I
think he gets a certain amount of he
knows instinctively what works what
doesn't right you know every villager is
enemy and continue where is he name on
will he come back
um you know at the start of the film you
state that the Kashmiri crisis has been
going on since 1947 and you talk about
the number of lives that have been lost
since but in the light of the recent
poll bomb attacks and the Bala could
strike what message do you hope to can
hope that the film will convey thank you
for asking me that
Rajiv I made this film for the
Millennials hmm you know we had we have
we have the world's youngest population
in our country okay and that's a
privilege and it's a huge opportunity
and one of the biggest opportunities we
have is the irreverence right you know
and the fact that they have uncle Google
with that thumbnails right because your
generation my generation I'm sorry
that's right no no I want you as my
pretty much foreign I do that of course
you can so our generation you know you
pretty much dished out the truth and we
sort of accepted it my BOB government
vollrath Emunah you know envy and we
went along these guys are very skeptical
you know the minute you start saying
something to a kid his eyes not when
news on his phone he's trying to check
it out now really is that you know is
that true
you know this skepticism is beautiful
and it's very important for politics
it's very important for polity to exist
so what I'm hoping now it might happen
in this film is that when this see a
reflection of themselves into characters
that I've created in Kashmir
they might perhaps turn around and say
hang on a second we're not being really
told the whole truth what what is
happening over there and then I hope
comes to rescue and they start really
googling the hell out of Kashmir and
finding out actually what goes on over
there the second thing that I'm hoping
is gonna happen is that some of them a
core a small core of them might even go
to Kashmir avoid the tourist areas you
know get into the villages speak to the
people over there and see how their
counterparts Kashmiri kids
[Music]
three things happened at the beginning
of the 90s and this is something really
important to understand one is economic
liberalisation to his armed insurgency
in Kashmir and three is I heard there he
was sitting 20-30 years after that right
now right so these three things that
happen together are where the two
Millennials have grown up right
Anil Anil from the rest of India and the
Millennial in Kashmir
now the Malil in the rest of India grew
up in a land of choices opportunities
are poor mobility the Millennial Kashmir
has grown up in a state of war with no
choices etc but what he has had or she
has had rather is a cause to fight for
so we have a millennial in a very
troubled part of our country with
contiguous borders with two extremely
hostile neighbors and nuclear arms
pointing at each other and at Inter box
that we almost saw flare-up in the last
couple of months and we have a
millennial here in the rest of India
okay who has had nothing but choices and
opportunities now which of these two are
you going to count on to solve this
issue I've made this film for the
Millennial in the rest of India that we
are the ones with the opportunities we
are the ones blessed with the choices
please let's open our eyes and see what
is happening with our counterparts over
there and start the process to address
the crisis of compassion address the
process of empathy that's what the
movies made for we wipe the history of
our people with our own
honey you had a role in in in Razi as
the protagonists mother
it was another film on the on the
conflict in India Pakistan conflict with
Kashmiri playing a key role in that
Razi was hugely successful alia has
swept most of the awards this season
another film that's been very successful
is Ori which of course is positioned as
the recreation of the 2016 surgical
strikes how do all of you view the
manner in which mainstream cinema
tackles the Kashmir issue well I think
it's exactly what Ashwin is saying it's
an offshoot of ignorance in a sense for
an offshoot of maybe not ignorance but a
one just one part of the narrative right
so there are there are many facets I
think what is very fascinating to me
about Kashmir in the first place is that
it is it did it has so many facets so
many layers so many realities and so
many truths and in a place like as
complex as this there is no one there is
no one man so sure
so therefore we are find only one
narrative hence we see oh god you know
Pakistan of course is the enemy you know
the army is this really a wonderful body
which is which is you know looking out
for us agree and it is I agree I agree
with all those things but there are
other sides to the story as in as they
would be because people are people you
know and they're not always perfect so
there are things which happen and which
we are really not told about and we
discover along the way it's much like in
school when you learn you go and learn
history and I talk about the Indian
Mutiny you talk about other things you
see them struggle and you go but I found
out about the mutiny when I left school
so I think these are the these are the
sort of narratives which we affair and
as a result we have a lot of slightly
lopsided view and I think it's because
cinema has to be a composite culture in
our country we have to be able to have
other discourses and and and you know
and see them and see it in its entirety
and I think that's only fair you know
Raj if it's so Kashmir is so beautiful
right it's and cinema has showcased that
beauty we are just you over the years
we've seen who returning it is that it's
also extremely tragic so if I may say it
beautifully
right now what happens is we keep
showing one diamond I have family in the
army so the Army is they are these
courageous lot of people who are I mean
we are in peace because of them yeah but
there is also human side to them right
they are living mentally in that space
very seldom does a film try to capture
that yeah yeah it's great to be a hero
we all know they're heroes right
but what are they living through so it's
imperative we've had border we've had
you really amazing films right I have
seen them I've enjoyed them but it's a
bit of a one track showcasing of what
they're doing there there is a lot more
it's a caricature sorry yeah if I can
introduce I mean it's a caricature you
know and like all caricatures it does
disservice to the reality it does
disservice to the audience whose respect
or who's receiving it and I think it
does great disservice to the people that
you're trying to represent now if you're
again I I circle back to my original
idea that if you're trying to call these
people as part of your Union you think
that okay coach Metis are ours and you
are to tongue hey it's comic lobby I
there's a mean a toot all right
robuttnik okay Lobo gato apnea Catherina
Keanu up couples a means to a rhetoric
for the last 70 years is about as a mean
it's not about low equal and this is a
problem and this has to change so when
you take a Bollywood film for example
and I'm not going to be as I mean I'm
going to be very straight up about this
I think they have done this service to
the cattle to the portrayal of Kashmir
is you know the closest example I can
tell you is when you see an Indian being
portrayed in American cinema with his
head shaking right with that son funny
singsong accent doesn't it make your
blood color show now imagine the
Kashmiri imagine the tragedy you have
these horrific incidents happening in
their place and you go then you show
these pretty hills these men and women
their love affairs and that odd Kashmiri
who come along is portrayed as this
exotic bird I mean
exactly the same fetishization as we
would that makes our blood curl when the
British cinema used to represent Indians
like Mowgli for instance in such films
like that in the 40s makes your blood
curl you know who the hell are these
people and why the hell do they do this
see this is the alienation we are
talking about our cinema independent
cinema in India has gone to the villages
of U P you know thanks to people like on
a rock we have films like that you know
which has been drawn out from right from
from the ground the art of the ground
and be brought into our cinemas you know
now we know so much about what happens
in you know in rural India right thanks
to these kinds of films so it's a very
similar process that needs to start
English me you know particularly because
of the inter box that we're sitting on
over there we need to start
understanding lives you know I just feel
that it's really in order for things to
ever improve or get better people's
problems and the tragedies that they've
had faced need to be acknowledged if you
don't acknowledge it it's like it never
happened
it feels like you don't exist and I
can't even imagine the helplessness of
somebody and I'm talking about all
facets even the Kashmiri pundits for
example right it's not with now you know
nothing happened nothing nobody else
them or anything so let's see in all in
all its in all its entirety I feel I'm a
great believer in this phrase truth and
reconciliation and it happened with the
Germans after the Second World War today
they have Holocaust museums because they
were and they shovel down the school
kids throat at the age of 14 onwards
that they have to go and see these
museums they have to understand that
this was a terrible phase in the history
and but only by confronting it can they
ever hope never that it will have a
repeat again and I I'm so I feel so I
feel very respectful of that sentiment
and strangely I'm also half German
somewhat German and I'm half Kashmiri so
I've got this like connection with what
these you know and I've always comparing
the two and thinking you know what we
really need to change our attitude
because it's only with this change of
attitude that anything can ever hope to
improve it's been an eye-opener for me
personally as a human being
this filming process because I had been
to Kashmiri as a teenager when I was
acting with Barry John in a play it's
all about money honey that's when I went
and from then to now when I went to
shoot this film I learned so many things
about the people that food and in
hindsight now I question I do this to
Kolkata I do this to Bangalore why don't
I do this more often to the northernmost
region of the nation and I myself say
it's the most beautiful place and we all
say that it is the most beautiful place
in the country so let's food for thought
right there and hopefully this film will
serve that purpose you know I was
actually going to ask that I was gonna
say um what was the experience of
actually making this film in Kashmir and
specifically for the two of you what had
some of the misconceptions that were
broken when you actually went there and
shot and and all your misconceptions
about about what Kashmir is is like
today you know sitting in sitting in in
Mumbai the narrative the affair or what
we tend to believe what did you discover
that you didn't know well to begin with
and I've been reciting this everywhere
since yesterday
all I introduced I walked out one day on
set in my costume in between two shots
because the DOP was taking time lighting
and I had walked down the same path in
my civilian clothes in the morning and
had this one power I'm a foodie so I
keep eating for him and he had me at the
most delicious really warm man really
sweet man I had a chat with him now when
I walked out in costume as a major the
looks I got Rajeev the stairs and
believe you me I could feel the piercing
and suddenly the line producer lady who
ran from the Hyneman don't walk out
alone somebody might throw something and
I was like why so it was there was a
perspective shift like you don't think
of such things sitting in Bombay right
I'm wearing an Indian Army's costume in
my own country I mean now we know in the
last year and a half to because of the
stone pelting episode and the news
throwing it up it's little things like
that that on a human level tell you you
don't know so much
I mean I read books I have friends wish
me days I've done a film it's Angela Lee
who's a Kashmiri I hear so much from him
but there is I've always felt there's
this something which is brewing inside
them and I've never quite been able a
point to be a girl yeah this experience
gave me some sort of perspective as to
why and it's for me to figure that out
it's for me to question myself which is
what I hope Ashwin is trying to do with
I mean which is what you'd achieve if
more people sees you see what happens is
that the British Kashmiri again back to
censorship you because the average
Kashmiri is a impression of what is
India is manifest in the uniform this
gentleman was wearing that day you know
it's manifest in the gun that he carries
and it's manifest in the jackboots that
you know March up and down his Street I
mean that is India hmm that's all we've
served up hmm in Kashmir we haven't
really served up anything else we
haven't started interaction between
schoolkids for example like you know
Sony was trying to talk about now have
we called Truth and Reconciliation
Commission which is sorely needed
because of the gross human rights abuses
that have happened in Kashmir you know
we need to stare these things in the
face and see right okay we respect the
institution but if they have been lapses
we need to acknowledge it and out of
respect for just human life and humanity
we need to say hey look can we
acknowledge this tell everyone the truth
you know call the perpetrators to book
and move on from here that will do two
things one is it'll obviously reassure
the average Kashmiri that look we are
being taken seriously after all and
we're not just being brushed under the
carpet and the second thing is the
institution itself will start
self-correcting right now these both
these things are very essential to
happen otherwise we're going to be in
this country for the longest time but on
Jones example is great because actually
this is the only impression that they
have and the impression we have and the
rest of the country looking back there
is similar I mean it's all to do with
costumes it's created it with the mask
it's visual in the driest visual it's
the mask it's the camo tribe you know
it's the gun and rhino and that's and
that's the image and it's the sort of
martyrdom did you have an irony I made
the short documentary series a few a few
a few months ago you know where I had
this audacious idea
I took should I reveal this what about
that right if you're sure I'm going to
reveal this okay I'm gonna I'm gonna run
this online shortly so every everyone
can see it right I convinced an army
officers daughter three of them actually
and three daughters of militants who
were both killed in Kashmir to meet each
other Wow yeah Wow but it's real
you know that's what I did I'm gonna
make this series and so gonna be a
document short documentary see this is
gonna play out on YouTube
along with the release of the film right
let's look at who these people are right
wha the daughters of the army officers
who are the daughters of the militants
they're human beings right you know
they're not aliens yeah let them start
talking to each other that's amazing
yeah hungry to see what unfolds yeah
let's tweak up a true yes
no I mean I always feel I mean I
whenever I go to Kashmir firstly you
have this really as an Indian as any
yeah as a person who comes from the rest
of India I'm glad you come there
anything you feel it's very oppressive
you know the residents at times it's
worse at times it's not so bad it's very
so kids over there who've grown up with
this that's for them normal but they
don't I say how are things normal I said
what is normal yeah we've grown up
within so for us it's normal we don't
know any other reality really when you
go to the rest of India that you feel I
don't know
Queenie yeah I'm where the army thank
you I mean if I didn't hurt you what so
he just said you know when we were
shooting kilometer away there was an
encounter going on no other was in all
the highway remember there was no
high-rate happened but you didn't come
with us to Srinagar when we're doing
this universe a jewel on the lake atcha
and we was shooting all our I mean it
was one big thing in Ponca choking HMT
in sari in outside downtown she out
session occurred there was an encounter
going on yeah not even a closer and a
half from the shoot
yeah but that's pretty normal normal
that's normal camera she look give up it
so you have to lean in eonni so happy
shutters down a happy shutters up here
you have been counted with happy
shutters opposed at the I remember when
I but it's projected to the raisiny
qiyamah the whole valley shut down
everything is this has happened I
remember talking to somebody you know
there was somebody I wanted to meet I'm
not gonna mention any names I wanted to
meet because I wanted to talk to that
person and I was told no he's not free
tomorrow because his boys are going for
stone-throwing just to give him holy key
look Haley yeah it was no so he's busy
with that because his boys are going for
stone throwing and Josh so but do you
want to meet another time and I was
leaving and all that so it was just very
interesting to know that okay fine you
happy you know I've been there and I've
seen ok the army is standing there very
you know or very scary and all that but
at the same time it's not so I mean it's
because it's normal for people so
they're having cigarette breaks with me
they're chatting with them chive EPA
somebody's helping somebody carry a bag
so there also are those I would say you
know so that's the maybe the the other
face of it but it's all it's all there
and it's it's all very very very
interesting and we get carried away by
you know if you the knock upon the in
Bombay city night Saturday night
people's very checking check around
Bhavan used to drive from the airport to
preserve our there's to be three places
when one day my bag was back either
opened now it so happened that in the
second check post the question you know
what are you going for and the driver
said film key shooter actor so one of
the army men had seen LSD right so then
he had a chat with me about the film and
he asked me so what are you going for so
I said just a documentary so I'm saying
we keep making such a big deal out of
little knock upon these on weekends here
people are living there on a daily basis
these are things we don't think of it's
very small but it starts hitting your
subconscious over a point of time I mean
this is one of the difficult things to
ask you to get right in the screenplay
which is why it took me three years to
get it because where you begin
you know do you go the human rights way
in which case no one's gonna come to
watch the film right right you try and
tell a story about two kids you know
breaking the hearts each other's hearts
then you're not going to do the service
discussion right do you try and talk
about how radical Islam is taking over
the valley where is then replacing
Sufism that's going to throw up a whole
new bunch of challenges you know you're
going to try and represent how the
armies sort of you know you want to talk
about what's happened to the people and
inevitably you end up talking about the
army and then you have a whole Pandora's
box of problems that you know open up
over there you know I mean where do you
begin strong yeah you know and that was
the challenge of the screenplay actually
so yeah sorry how did you get into the
head of this woman you of course play
this mother whose son has been picked up
and who never returns and they wait and
hope how did you sort of put yourself in
that woman's head and heart with quite a
lot of difficulty because probably my
perception of a woman whose son is his
is not around and she doesn't know
what's happened to him he's very
different to what probably the reality
is so Ashwin was a great help there also
I saw his documentary and you know the
women whose sons have disappeared
they're very very emotional lists
emotionless I think somewhere down the
line you cut out that and he was very
helpful in that in that aspect because I
would have been much more sentimental
about it just being a you know mother
and thinking of my child not being there
and all I would have probably gone in a
completely different direction so I
really relied on the director here who
had this experience of these of teeth of
such you know women having suffered this
so it was very different to my what my
natural reaction would have been would
have been a wreck but I was not a wreck
I was pretty much fit sort of not even I
wouldn't even say resigned I think I
would just been at Qatar they didn't my
heart in some in some way you know we
also meet her many years later yeah
that's probably how she may have been
early on definitely early on I mean we
would somewhere down the line you do its
it's you know like you know it is like a
breakup you've kind of read I mean it's
you see example but somewhere down the
line you just put that stone on your
heart and you you can't keep fearing how
much can you feel so you stopped feeling
at some point Antron without giving away
too much I don't know if it's fair to
say and we've already said he's them
he's a major the character that you play
but he is um in a sense the bad guy of
the piece is he how did you it's it's
complex right how did you view him while
preparing to play him I could eat in
your small example well and is it easy I
mean is it is it it's easy for for a
viewer to say bad guy good guy sort of
located as purely has been black and
white term but in terms of playing it
dodgy when I was talking when things not
finalized and I was about to fly out I
have like I said my problem the army so
it's something that he recited to me and
it gave me again a perspective he said
when in the valleys we come ten homes in
a village there are nine innocent homes
one out of that we find something or
somebody pops out and fires at us but
the fact is the other nine homes which
were innocent have also been affected so
their anger is that not right are we
wrong in doing our job hmm there's no
right and wrong
sure you know that's the first thing we
need to accept it's all very great so
from an actor's point of view it took me
in a space which I really enjoyed
because it was new to me and then Ashwin
had written him a certain way and I
don't think he's a bad guy he's a 26
year old major from the Bihar regiment
who's been thrown into the valley it's
the lovely conversation we had when I
was doing a background work on the
character probably he's just got married
and he hasn't had time to spend with his
wife remember so now this is a guy who's
just got married on his wedding night
he's been called that you need to leave
tonight now he reaches there and
probably sees one of his brothers get
killed or his best friend get killed
this is the conversation me and him had
that immediately gave me perspective I
said all right let's now this is the guy
who's probably studied in Patna so he's
had that sort
conditioning he's been exposed to those
kind of things the aggression in Bihar
is inbuilt in him so don't go by the way
he looks because he can be a real pain
yeah when thrown in a situation like
that so my approach my take off point
was that and because of the lack of time
which in this film I feel was a blessing
when I see it
I didn't over prep it I'll let instinct
fire right and I think that worked for
this particular character because it's
not good or bad it's it's like I said
previously it's about the human element
of the character because these are
people right even when they're killing
and like I keep saying in films we do
show the bravado and the machoism of
farming man you know we do that a bit
because they are all of that but there
is also a human element to them right
and that doesn't make me we all have
Dre's in our life it's on our all black
and white and what the Army is going
through there imagine walking down the
street and your own countrymen looking
at you the way I just narrate it's nice
I mean you and I can't even imagine it
it's only when and then living that life
what's really scary I mean ya ever know
everybody's a potential threat to you as
as the AI as it is the other way around
and so it's a very it's a very volatile
situation yeah yeah the Hindu concept of
thermally works here very well yeah you
know because that is what I think is
your last resort current in a situation
like this it is not right to be
ransacking people's homes and up turning
and turning them upside down you know
especially and it equally is not right
not to do so
so that dilemma on the battlefield of
kuruksetra that is expressed yeah is the
dilemma of the Indian Armed Forces to
the english-made you know and they're
these boys out there trying to perform
what is essentially their term and that
is what is being expressed and then when
one car gets through everybody they
don't realize how many are actually
prevented to their pointing fingers at
that one incident but what about the
hundreds of army men who are standing
over there grappling with these animals
every day right some of them may be
through the fact of the conditioning or
whatever it is excessively performing
their duties which is also human some of
them may be underperforming and so on
and so forth so it's not possible to say
where's the Juche because they are not
talking about that in army mrs. Graham
in army message' should go and talk to a
me man they are not talking about
where's the Jovi I'm talking about these
issues you know and they're talking
about trauma yeah trauma PTSD yeah so
Lee's character classic case of PTSD
post traumatic traumatic stress for
statics thank you most traumatic stress
disorder the entire valley suffers from
it in this one psychiatric hospital in
value right I mean that that goes into
another sort of issue about negligence
but the fact is that that's how
character it's not that she doesn't feel
it hmm
it's a way of dealing with it I mean I
was bullied at school I blacked out
right it's how you deal I've actually
thought those years when I meet those
guys again
I do actually don't remember things that
you know they may have done to me
and this is you just block it like a
router dealing with you know your brain
can't deal with those yeah so you just
black it out your circuit breaks right
circuit breaker and in his character
it's it's the turn you know and how is
pregnant with these sort of
possibilities really it's dramatically
it's you played key role in the film
Arshad loan why was it important to to
be this character yourself well you know
I got into I was I used to perform on
stage 1999 is the last time I performed
right 20 years ago and the reason I
moved to film I didn't have any
particular interest in making films I'll
be very honest the reason I moved to
film at that time there was no real
career opportunity in making doing
theater right so I was I said okay let
me start but in order to direct I had to
write screenplays learn to do that and I
learned how to direct then I then
Kashmir happened to me and I became
political in the documentary side it was
just like wait hang on a second I 20
years later I'm just like dude what
happened I wanted to act yeah and
suddenly you know twin 20 years on you
know so when I wrote this part I said
man
got to be now or never cause otherwise
this is never going to happen and of
course you know the stress of directing
and I was gonna is it hard
I'd never do it it's it's a high I must
say you know it's a real high and it's
not easy at all and the responsibilities
quadrupled actually is not just doubled
it's quadruple you know because you have
to pay attention to the other hand that
was duties to the other rack yeah
you know it's not true as yourself I
think the prep really helped because of
course I have sat with the people the
kind of people that I was meeting but I
didn't know frankly to be very honest I
didn't know who else I could trust with
this part because he's such a difficult
part to play he operates on such a
Razors Edge drag of proper officer of
what is acceptable it rhymes
and he's pushing so many envelope true
you know I mean he's a radical
fundamentalist at the same time he's got
this he's got this whole double game
going on I mean he's he's a very shady
character you know very very dodgy
sinister character Wow and you only get
that by one word he's called genes right
that's the whole personality correct
body or what do you know why does
someone called genes right it's it but
coming from that to where he's come to
now this is sort of almost
wheeler-dealer sort of character one
thing really helped actually was to give
him an academic air which I think makes
him look even more sinister and and more
so he does very little I mean that's
what I wanted to do I just wanted to I
mean I'm very expressive as you can see
yeah I'm sorry about the place right I
have to just tone it down and just do
very little you know and just let and
let stuff and I really admire people who
play poker you know because that poker
face
it's stunning that's just one little
twitch of the eyebrow just gives you
because you know what what I wanted to
do is I want the audience to imagine the
character of that rather than me play it
out for the enemy right nothing for the
audience Ryan writing spoon-fed all the
stuff like that little twitch
let let them bring their entire you know
all the poker players they've seen in
their lives
bring it to my face you know my job is
done yes quickly say the two things that
I really enjoyed or really thought were
very interesting about the film was one
also how sort of the audience
it's the 16-year old girl who is in a
sense the eyes and ears of the audience
because you are sort of discovering
you're discovering as as she is and and
I think to the device of hers of a
camera phone and and her being this
photography not who's shooting
everything and taking pictures and
videos is beautiful because you're sort
of discovering as she is and the other
thing was just you know of course it's
about Kashmir but the relationships as I
was telling you earlier just just the
just just the fact that there's such a
real beautiful relationship to you that
and characters that you can get invested
in even if you're not entirely familiar
with the Kashmir story the relationship
between between your character and your
daughter know who's who's looking to get
remarried and and that sort of nod of
approval from from her former
mother-in-law can you talk about that
and why that adds so many layers to the
film which is of course a political
story in it so of course about about you
know where we are as Kashmir but it's
also it's you know you can also invest
in the in the relationships and the
other let's take it one by one so yeah
for instance you know it starts off very
much like Instagram photography it's
it's a bit like you know snaps yeah yeah
yeah etc and it moves into sort of
almost forensic photography that's right
so there is a there is a whole I mean
the photograph start giving you a
journey of the character some senses
true because she starts she starts
becoming from from an Instagram
photographer she starts becoming a
subjective photographer and then goes
into this entirely investigative mould
almost becoming a photojournalist in
some sense it's true so that was
intentional I mean and the shots that
we've chosen the first part of it I gave
the camera to the actor and I said
listen just do whatever you like
correct right and then there's a
particular scene I don't know if this is
going to be a spoiler but there's a
particular scene in which the entire
journey
surprised in a pretty that's right
pretty hard way right right and it
becomes even more emphatic because
they're kind of these smiley pictures
correct you know and there's this whole
violence which the smiley pictures are
sort of destroyed yeah I didn't want to
say that thank you
[Laughter]
yeah so nice character is concerned and
the relationship between the
daughter-in-law and the mother-in-law I
mean this is the sort of you know this
is my subversion evict I guess it's it's
a bit like two women who've lost in a
sense the same thing yeah
don't know who else to turn to so rather
than go into each other and take support
from each other they get they go into a
space of venting their frustration out
on each other so it's like what happens
tragically when a couple loses a child
you know the inevitably it ends up in
the break-up because because of the
familiarity and because of the fact that
there's no gel because of the
claustrophobia of that situation
you know and I just extrapolated that as
a screenwriter I was trying to figure
out a way of dealing with that dynamic I
mean how would she take the fact that
her daughter-in-law wants to get
remarried now the daughter-in-law didn't
really need to arrive all the way to
this little remote village right to take
her permission it's not necessary but
she felt compelled in some senses to do
so you know so that's a huge step coming
all the way from the UK to do this and
then introducing this new guy I mean
which is another cocktail oh I know and
who's pretty much just his photos very
go who's just sort of grooming around
you know I already know who this guy is
except every now and then sort of he he
sort of he's some sort of authority but
you're not quite sure what he is and
then she's like this strange man in my
house and and of course she's over the
moon because she has a daughter but she
had a daughter
she's totally mixed with that emotion as
well you know and so the idea really was
to show this family dynamic again we go
back to the idea of saying that look is
a human being with human emotion Grimes
but how character and and the character
played by Natasha imago in the film the
torture in rows in a beg your pardon
yeah and they they have this they have
this dynamic which is which is built on
trust
yeah suspicion you know at the same time
and it fires and both those cylinders
yeah and you're like these you see I
could have made a movie on each of this
that's true actually yes you know yes
yeah I could have made a movie I beg
your pardon oh my god story a big one
you know I could have made a movie on
her character story for sure on
perviness character story you know
played by Maya surround correct the love
interest of of Shiva Shiva Marina who
play I mean whole story is also equally
fast right right oh gosh it's it's a
it's a complex it that is a that is an
incredible arc as well see I'm their
relation I mean the whole relationship
with at through the point there and also
this young girl coming all the way from
England yeah a stranger to me but she is
my son's daughter and then again you
know that would painful thing of oh god
now you know my son is not here but
she's here and then she doesn't know me
at all I'm so alien to her to anything
that she is experienced yet the right
moment where you give her a huge piece I
mean your your that's what I'm saying so
it's so fitting like it's such a real
saying that you know we don't know which
are the other is we're both the other to
the other and then and then we are but
but there is there is this connection
which is so deep so complete can't you
communicate yeah one is speaking and
Anuj the other ones on sitting in
Kashmiri grab so it's like you know but
they can but they communicate
communicate right my favorite moment in
the film is between Sunni auntie's
character
and where the husband the mother says
correct and then when she comes home and
she looks at the photo and she says I
try or something just that reaction
she's very yeah yeah it's magic isn't it
between human beings of what we perceive
and what it actually is there it in lies
the little touch which is what makes his
films I believe makes me Natasha's
characters an obscure actor sort of
Express this again it goes back to
caricatures she's created a caricature
of this mother-in-law in her mind so
much so that she feels that it's
necessary to change the way her daughter
looks to present to the mother-in-law
but the mother-in-law is much more
chilled out right and far more
progressed in her brain than that you
know and that's like we think that they
surprised us the grandparents of
chilled out in the I was actually very
surprised as I business boiler that he's
what if she tells the grandfather I'm
stepping out right after what happened
in the yeah but really many
congratulations I think you're going to
film that's that's that's very layered
and I think that there's a there's a lot
to chew on when you sort of watch the
film I I really do hope it finds its
audience all the best and
congratulations on a job very well done
lots more and here's hoping that you
will continue to sort of steer the part
thank you so much yeah tell the stories
that need to be thank you thank you
thank you very much

jMWWqrN_L1s,Priyanka Gandhi Tears Into PM For Saying &#39;Cong Speeches Applauded In Pakistan&#39; | Faceoff,ElectionsWithNews18 #BattleOf2019 #LokSabhaElections2019 #Elections2019 #PriyankaGandhi #PMModi Congress leader and ...,2019-03-29T17:15:00Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jMWWqrN_L1s/hqdefault.jpg,"good evening welcome to face off my name
is Sokka Jacob within the next few
minutes we're expecting mother pradesh
chief minister
kamal not to be addressing the news 18
rising multi pradesh summit which is
being held live in Bhopal will be
cutting across life to that in the next
few minutes but first let's bring you up
to speed with some of the big stories
the big political stories of the day
Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is taking on the
BJP in the BJP stuff in utter Pradesh
with a massive road show in Ayodhya
these were pictures from earlier this
evening where huge crowd strong Priyanka
Von Teese road show through the temple
town and she didn't lose the opportunity
to target Prime Minister Modi and the
BJP over their biryani diplomacy at the
Congress
she hit back asking who went to Pakistan
to eat biryani when she was asked a
question about what the prime minister
said yesterday in his opening campaign
rally that every time the Congress or
Congress's leaders ask for support or
evidence of the airstrikes they are only
helping the cause of Pakistan she's also
kept up the suspense of whether she will
contest the looks of my elections and
from where and of course the speculation
being that she will contest from
Varanasi against Prime Minister Narendra
Modi she has said that she's ready to
fight elections from anywhere that her
party asks her to all right a very very
formidable show of strength there a
10-kilometer Roadshow from Faizabad to
Ayodhya where through the evening hours
the last couple of hours certainly we've
had a substantial number of people turn
up to see Priyanka Gandhi we don't know
if much of this will translate into
votes this is certainly the citadel of
the BJP
are you there has been integral to the
growth of the party gentle party but let
me go across the zev of RC who's joining
us live from IO dia it's been pretty
impressive even when Rahul Gandhi went
there are just before the 2017 assembly
elections we did not see this kind of
reception is this just general junta
who's landing up there out of curiosity
or could this potentially be prospective
voters
[Music]
cuz that is of the big question we tried
to talk to some of the IOT I never see
the ones a word you know coming out of
their homes with their families with
kids and all want him to catch a glimpse
of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra a lot of it was
curiosity when it comes to bystanders
but they sure are number of people the
number of Congress supporters who were
out on the streets of IOT adapt zakah
was very impressive because when was the
last time you saw Congress flags being
waved and you know go through old you
know the old being Band Baaja and all of
that
oh and congress slogans being raised on
the streets away with her with this
magnitude and that is something that we
anchor Gandhi Walter has managed to do
essentially this was a political message
that she wanted to send to the BJP to
her opinions that in they are strong
holding the be trapeze stronghold in are
you there which is considered to be
something central to the BJP s campaign
Priyanka Gandhi Vadra
while campaigning in East you P can also
manage to get the you know that kind of
turnout in the city of Ayutthaya that
essentially words were P witnessed on
the ground as we track her Roadshow from
fans about to Hanuman van getting here
in our job and the crowd certainly was
unprecedented on a lot more then what
was witnessed in the previous Congress
Roadshow and Rahul Gandhi campaigned
here before you P state assembly
elections so certainly the Priyanka
Gandhi factor was witnessed here on the
streets of order it's interesting I mean
as as as unbelievable as it sounds the
Congress did have a member of parliament
from Faizabad the parliamentary
constituency where IO dia is an assembly
segment in 2009 dr. Lyn Malka three was
the Congress candidate who got elected
from Faizabad
so it's not that difficult to that
improbable a proposition that the
Congress not just forget about winds
feather bath but gives a good run for
its money
to both the BJP and the good one then
candidates what is it that's driving
these people to come there and and get a
glimpse off of Priyanka Gandhi is it
because the Congress really stands a
half a chance there in Faizabad or is it
because of the curiosity of who she is
and what her lineages
I would say I wouldn't rule out the fact
that the Congress candidate liberal
country is the communist country this
time around is well he did manage in
victory in 2009 and today we saw
Priyanka Gandhi withdraw heavily
campaigning for normal country are not
just heard in the city of Ayutthaya but
all through the day when she came from
rival relief to are you there all the
way she made several pit stops akka said
we'll look at Sahaj and she did campaign
for America three four fairs apart looks
of a constituency so certainly after
watching today's visual of the kind of
turnout that that you know that that
came out in the streets if I was a for
Priyanka Gandhi Basra campaigning for
Nevada number 104 felt about jokes about
the BJP and a star got bantha and
candidates certainly would would feel
worried today after after the kind of
traction are we so animal country is a
strong candidate for the Communist Slavs
because he did manage to win 2009 now in
the 21c that the Communist Party won I
used her was one of them all right stay
on with us Ava because through the
course of the last four or five hours or
so she basically has taken this she's
been out on the road from home 80 all
the way to a yogya and you can see those
pictures she's visiting the honeymoon
goodie temples she's not going to the
disputed side but through the course of
the last few hours or so she has spoken
on some of the most contentious issues
in this election including once again
reiterating that she will contest if her
party so desires she's also quite
uncannily today in this particular round
aa sort of shed down her inhibitions
about taking on Prime Minister Modi
directly so let's play out both the both
of those sound bites and I'm gonna go
back to them
Connie Connie Connie Connie clear - okay
Tina then we go back to zebra who who's
been tracking Priyanka Gandhi for the
last three days in her latest tour - OH
- predation somehow today she seems to
have shed her inhibitions about taking
on the prime minister directly whether
it is dropping very direct references to
her her chances of fighting against the
Prime Minister in Varanasi or even you
know on the Pakistan question she didn't
seem on the defensive certainly yes
Sarkar in fact we saw an aggressive
Priyanka Gandhi was Rustique strong
drives against the Prime Minister one of
course was on the Pakistan question when
she said it was not us it was the prime
minister who went to meet her pakistan
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif Sharif and
had been yani with him so that of course
was one strong a comment from yoga
Gandhi Vadra now the strong comments
after that I'd like to point out is when
she was holding these new cuts aversion
and she was addressing Congress workers
and people who gathered in Fez about she
talked
essentially about Varanasi and about how
the Lok Sabha constituency is upset with
with with its Member of Parliament she
said the last time I was in Varanasi and
I spoke to people they are telling me
that he no he never came here and spoke
to them in person you only
massive roadshows so she talks about how
the Prime Minister roams all across the
globe but Huck has no time for his own
constituency so she did take the attack
directly to the Prime Minister making
direct attacks on the Prime Minister and
talking about his constituency Varanasi
remember taka it's very significant
because we are constantly asking her
that if she does then textbooks of our
elections will she choose Varanasi as
the probable seat so all of that was
pretty much evident in today's Priyanka
Gandhi vedras our show are all through
the day from bribery lead to Ayodhya
nobody stay on with us what are you
seeing on the right of your screen are
live shots of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra at
IO dia which is of course the temple
town and which is integral to the
history and the rise of the BJP it is a
fair crowd that's come there I don't
know looking at the screen how many have
turned up but it's a 10 kilometer
road show it's easily in the thousands
in a town which is not associated with
the Congress party you've got a fair
number of people turning out whether
these are just you know curious
bystanders who want to get a glimpse of
Priyanka Gandhi because he's a celebrity
campaigner for the Congress party or if
these are genuine prospective voters we
don't know but all we can tell from you
know the pictures on the screen is that
a substantial number of people have
turned up to watch and perhaps to listen
to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra but let me play
out those two bytes why this is
significant is she's she's done two
things one she has dropped her
inhibitions in taking on the Prime
Minister directly even on a question of
you know national security and and and
going to Pakistan yesterday the Prime
Minister said that if the Congress were
to be elected then crackers will burst
in Pakistan today she took on that
question head-on and she's also dropped
her inhibitions at least a notch or two
about the question of will she be the
candidate to take on Prime Minister Modi
from the constituency of Banaras
let's listen in or to go to those
sunrise
I'll have to get you know Nikita other

told the court that nero moody
threatened to kill a witness and offered
bribe to another the prosecutor also
said that there is a great risk of nero
moody fleeing now if he's granted bail
neither Modi's counsel has told the
court that he has no criminal record he
has no intention to flee and therefore
he should be given bail all right master
dick he's joining us live she tracks the
MEA for us so so really I mean the the
what it boils down to is whether need of
Modi a has the ability and the intention
to influence witnesses and B whether
he's a flight risk
on both of those counts maja what do we
know so far from the arguments that have
been made by both the prosecution side
and the defense side well the Indian
side through the prosecution certainly
wants to make a case that he is a flight
risk and there are several reasons for
it also czaka for instance even after
near of Modi's passport was revoked when
India contacted the United Kingdom with
regards to his whereabouts the UK had
come back to India saying that despite
his passport being revoked near of Modi
had indeed traveled on the Indian
passport for one more month after the
passport was revoked so clearly the fact
remains that this is a rich businessman
who was conducting his business as usual
sitting in London he has influence he
has money and moreover we have also got
details of how he has multiple passports
he also has three were pastor resident
permits in UAE Hong Kong and therefore
because his business was spread across
many parts of the globe he certainly has
influence to be able to flee the UK this
is being put as a point for him not to
get been however on the other side there
the defense says that if such is the
case a need of Moody would have fled the
country earlier on but he has no in
tension softly the United Kingdom from
what we are picking up czaka
from his sources Sanjay Suri has picked
up in London that even in bail is
granted today - near of Modi then they
will be on very stringent conditions and
the the most important condition here
would be that he cannot leave England
and by England I mean only England and
Wales because this Court has
jurisdiction only on that they are not
even looking at to him moving out to
other parts of the UK like Scotland and
on an island in fact there could also be
a provision or a condition here for
electronically tracking him so that he
is not able to flee the United Kingdom
in terms of you know obviously the bail
application is going to be decided today
and whether the judge decides if this
needs to go to trial and when this needs
to go to trial we are looking at a
minimum of a few months if not longer
than that before this trial can conclude
certainly czaka and that we've seen that
in the case of Vijay Mallya as well the
case has stretched over a period of over
one year now and even after the hearing
you know starts in the extradition case
it will depend on how the prosecution
presents the case and what the defense
comes up as an argument in the case of
Vijay Mallya if I can cite that as an
example a look at how Vijay Mallya used
Sanjeev Charla's case to cite prison
conditions as being Indian prison
conditions as being violative of human
rights and that stretched the case to
several months because India had to
present its case India made a proper
video footage of the Arthur Road jail to
tell the court the Westminster
magistrate's court where this man where
even nearer more these matters being
heard that prison conditions in India
will not be violative of Vijay Mallya's
Human Rights now that matter has pretty
much been settled here and that may not
be an issue that will be raised by Nero
Modi considering that this say this same
Court has seen the prison conditions in
India and has approved a fit bias you
know giving the
in favor of Indian vegimalese case
however there could be several other
arguments that need Aboudi site could
present the first being that this is not
a case of dual criminality
in the case of extradition dual
criminality needs to be proven because
the Indian side needs to prove what is
an offense here in India the financial
fraud that he has conducted is also an
offense in the United Kingdom to be able
to get his extradition so really this
matter could go on for some time and the
manner in which this bail plea itself is
being fought should give us a sense that
this might not be as easy a case as we
might have presumed and that need of
Modi side or defense will also put out
the best possible arguments and India
will have to also be constantly sharing
information with Crown Prosecution to to
make a foolproof case against him all
right we live with that we'll see how
this plays out it's happening right now
in a court in Westminster in London
Nero Modi's bail application as to
whether he will get out of jail or
whether he will be sent back into
judicial erm on I'm gonna leave it with
that thanks very much

jangly
which stars video jumble and a herd of
elephants left me with the same feeling
that I had after I had watched blue the
Akshay Kumar shock movie that was shot
in the Bahamas I was more interested in
observing the creatures then tracking
what the human characters were up to the
elephants in jangly are majestic
sensitive and sharp which is more than
one can say about the humans in the film
with youth plays Raj a vet in Mumbai who
returns home to the elephant sanctuary
run by his father in Orissa after ten
years
here he is united both with the folks
and the beasts that he'd befriended
while growing up the merriment is
short-lived however recruited by Agoura
businessman a deadly hunter played by
other Kulkarni has penetrated the
sanctuary to capture a Tusker for its
precious ivory now this is a
standard-issue revenge plot with an
anti-poaching message and as many as
eight writers are credited with banging
out the story screenplay additional
screenplay and dialogues of this
kindergarten level film yes you heard
that right eight writers still somehow
virtually every scene they come up with
is flat and inert the characters are
even less compelling I can confirm a
thinks of himself as a poacher with
principles
mahjongg guru kuyou he nahi martha own
kombucha blocker Tahu kyon ki is that
kurta whom he declares insisting that he
kills not for the wealth but for the
thrill there are two women in the film
Amma who'd played by pooja Sivan and a
journalist played by Asha but and
although they have decent screen time
their roles amount to precious little
Akshay Oberoi plays a protagonists
childhood friend and forest ranger and
there's also makrand deshpande as the
grizzled guru guru a wise teacher of the
ancient martial arts form Kalaripayattu
who spouts corny lines and is
permanently sozzled but the film of
course is intended as a showcase for the
impressive action
skills of its leading man with youth
Jamal who makes leaping and gliding and
dangling look like child's play in one
bit he mounts an elephant standing tall
on its back in another scene he
vanquishes a bunch of men while chained
to a table he even repeats that stunt
from commando to in which he slides out
of a room through a slim opening in the
wall
it's impressive stuff even if the acting
is still clunky directed by Chuck
Russell who helmed the mask one of jim
carrey's early hits Jung Lee is
ultimately underwhelming except when it
stays focused on the animals a pre
intermission Massacre scene is frankly
the only genuinely emotional bit in the
film but that wouldn't acting that I
just told you about it robs the moment
of its full impact for its finale the
film suddenly shifts from the forest to
an abandoned warehouse and it becomes
your standard action movie climax with
cartoonish Chinese bad guys a villains
blonde mole and a dozen or so henchmen
who dropped like flies
when the hero kicks punches and pummels
away at them yon been there seen that
the animals deserved better and so did
we

JocTyp6aW5E,"Petitioner Who Fought In SC For Women Entry In Sabarimala A BJP Member, Says Kerala Minister",Kerala Devaswom minister Kadakampally Surendran has claimed that the BJP and Sangh parivar were behind the legal battle ...,2019-03-29T14:15:00Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JocTyp6aW5E/hqdefault.jpg,"now despite the election commission's
warning shabarimala continues to be one
of the biggest election issues in the
state of Kerala that there was some
Minister Khar anomaly surendran today
alleged and this is a big allegation
that the petition the original petition
asking for women's entry into
shabarimala was a conspiracy hatched by
the BJP because one of the petitioners
who filed a PIL in the Supreme Court
back in 2006 happens to be an advocate
called Prerna Kumari who's a BJP member
now the PIL had demanded entry of women
into the temple remember the BJP has
been spearheading the protests against
the Supreme Court verdict which allowed
the entry of women into Chevy lumina
Nieto is joining us live from
Thiruvananthapuram of course this is a
big allegation a big statement made by
the day with some minister but correct
me if I'm wrong the the original
petition that was filed in the Supreme
Court was filed by the Young Lawyers
Association
Prevnar Kumari this individual could be
a member of the Waialae and could
possibly be also be a member of the BJP
but why would that take away from the
the rest of the petitioners and the
organisation that filed a petition
now the Young Lawyers Association had
filed this petition and what the Davison
Minister has been a leading is that of
the five petitioners who had filed this
petition Prerna Kumari is one among them
and Davison Minister had earlier also
raised this saying that those people who
were associated to the BJP and RSS are
responsible of all Shah before this
entire case to be filed in Shabri
mallanna what he is trying to do here is
that telling to the people of Kerala
that you should really understand what
has happened in the background
it's a BJP themselves or people
associated with the BJP themselves had
filed this case and here on the streets
and in shabarimala they are trying to
create violence so you should understand
this so that was a clear message to the
people of Kerala to the waters basically
telling that if people come ask for
words in the name of shabarimala tell
them this or you should also keep in
mind this we asked cumin abroad shaker
and the BJP candidate from
Thiruvananthapuram also about this and
what he said was that Prerna Kumari what
she did would would have been out of her
individual responsibility the party
doesn't have anything to do with this
and this is not the BJP line okay let's
play that out we had a short interview
with cumin ohm Raja Shekar and who like
me too said is the BJP candidate from
the turban to bottom looks of a
constituency he says that this has been
done at an individual capacity he's
denied any kind of BJP organisational
link to the petitioner who was part of
the Young Lawyers Association
so Reggie Miller is one of the main
subjects we had to discuss with the
Russian campaign so many issues are
there are issues are very important so
everyone is also important national
issues up there that issues are also
important the Modi government has to
come in there in the election so we want
to have the Modi administration all
these are the issues we have to discuss
in the election campaign Naga mary has
filed the case it's on her
responsibility party has taken a
decision on the subdomain ratio that is
the party stag party stand is very clear
so we have launching the agitation for
the last so many months and also so many
people are in jail
they are contesting the cases so the
light so people are involved in the
agitations and all this nowadays
now the way we currently take up this
issue
part of the reason why cumin rajsekharan
was brought back he was governor of
Missouri why he was brought back and is
being fielded now in termina to put up
against such a rule is that the BJP is
hoping that Shabnam Allah will help turn
the tide in favor of the party but
neither really what what are the
realistic chances of the BJP were very
rarely do elections swing on one issue
and as a motivation Ramallah was does it
have the potential of helping the BJP
open its account in Kerala see the
Shabri mela issue has the potential of
helping the BJP to increase the award
shares but to the extent of winning a
seat that is something which we will
have to wait in watchin the chances when
you look at it right now at where we are
standing it looks very very very little
now if you realistically look at the
chances of BJP the riven in the poem is
one constituency where they have a real
chance and that is why they have fielded
cumin and Raj Shekar and one of the
senior members he had to resign as
governor and to come back here so this
is something which would have which
would have helped BJP increased their
vote share to get more people to vote
for them but this is not just one issue
we should also remember that this was a
state that had seen the worst floods
people are still finding it difficult to
get back to their lives there are many
pockets in Putnam theta itself where
people are still finding it difficult
all these issues will be affected and
among the youth when we are talking to
them a quality education and the lack of
jobs is also a major concern that many
of these youngsters are racing in both
the Congress as well as the left friend
is raising this issue of joblessness
in a in the you threw out their election
campaign so all these issues are there
we cannot say that it's just that one
Shabri Millau issue will decide the fate
of the 20 load Sabha seats okay we'll
see how this plays out on the question
of jobs of course this recent return of
a lot of nr eyes from the Gulf
particularly is also adding to concerns
about joblessness and opportunities or

in the world after the United States
China and Russia to demonstrate
anti-satellite missiles capability by
shooting down a satellite our own
satellite now calling the reports the
target was a decommissioned old Indian
satellite our own satellite which was
eliminated within three minutes sharp
let us go and meet the alleged scientist
at DRDO who makes these great things
possible
yes scientists can destroy - for us the
missile was developed indigenously by us
yes tell us we hear that US China Russia
well they had taken several years to
develop this technology but India has
made history in the very first shot yes
yes absolutely
India has made history in the first

flying in the low Earth orbit after it
reversed the distance of almost 300
kilometers from Earth within three
minutes of its launch Wow 300 kilometers
away from Earth and just three minutes
to reach low-earth orbit yes otherwise
it takes 50 hours to reach Milan in
orbit
in Malad in here Oshiwara in Mumbai have
you gone that could have been destroyed
also I would have really complained
anyway
your mission is completed so what does
it mean exactly from any external
nuclear or brutal trade that may come
from near or far away near or far away
now far away you have demonstrated but
what about any brutal thread that may
come from nearby nearby no we have not
yet made any missiles that can reach
Mamata Banerjee as yet out out I didn't
mean that I meant Pakistan Oh

that controversial NSSO report that was
withheld by the government that
suggested that unemployment was at a
forty five-year-old high
now the government including the prime

taxi aggregators and the jobs they've
provided to illustrate job creation that
has happened in the last five years now
we are not getting into the numbers in
this story but Ron Joon Sharma spends a
day shadowing and uber driver partner to
find out what this job entails there is
no doubt that Ola and uber have made
allies fairly simple day or night Sunday

3zrHLmwzHRk,Why So Few Women Are Represented In Politics? | Reporters Project,"In a country with a whooping 58 crore women population, only 66 are in Lok Sabha, Deepa Balakrishnan and Revathi Rajeevan ...",2019-03-21T13:30:01Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3zrHLmwzHRk/hqdefault.jpg,"[Music]
this reporters project where we record
your stories from across the country now
the election dates have been announced
and campaigning is on in full swing
statements announcements allegations and
counter allegations are flying in thick
and fast the one bit of news that caught
our attention this week was Orissa Chief
Minister Naveen Patnaik saying that his
party the Biju Janata Dal would provide
33% reservation to women candidates in
these elections meanwhile in Chennai
Rahul Gandhi said that if the Congress
comes to power it will provide 33%
reservation in government jobs to women
and that it will also finally help pass
the Women's Reservation bill in
Parliament now we know that all of that
means pretty little and nobody knows
that better than women who forged
careers for themselves in electoral
politics and yet it's these women and
others who have decided to keep the
cynicism aside and take it upon
themselves to change this saree status
quo as Deepa balakrishnan and Revathy
Raj even report
these men and women in pink are dancing
to the tune of project Shakti the online
campaign that started in December 2018
is being taken across 19 cities by
activists with the aim to mobilize more
women in electoral politics on Women's
Day the goal was spelt out loud and
clear to get more women elected to the
17th Lok Sabha the anger is palpable
students academics homemakers in young
professionals vociferous about the scant
representation to fifty percent of the
population
more than 70 years after independence
when I see your ballots that contains
90% male names actually 92% male names
only 8% of tickets are given to women it
sends a clear indication even if you're
a man that men are the ones that are
responsible for the governance of this
country we make the policies we make the
laws and women of no place in it so if
you're a young man you're shaping the
thought of that man as to you know where
women belong and where men belong right
if women belong in the house
it is the Parliament house in which we
belong and if I'm a first-time female
voter I mean every election we keep
saying there are lakhs of new voters
first time what is being added to the
rules if I'm you know graduating from
college if I'm in college and eagerly
looking forward to my first vote again
if I go see the ballot box I'm not going
to see anyone that looks like me you see
we went we were part of the research
team and we looked at the figures for
every party every state and it's so low
it's so pathetic
it's all ins the women MLA F women MPs
are in single digits while the men are
in like hundreds 200 300 400 and then
women are like 8 3 2 1 some parties have
zero
how can you submit a candidate list with
zero women in it and I don't understand
that's what really changed my mind
[Music]
at loss count according to the
population census of 2011 there are 58
crore women in India contrast that to
the fact that there are 66 women in the
Lok Sabha or a minuscule 12% and you get
a sense of how skewed things are time
and again we're just asking only one
question because as a political party
what is stopping you personally from
giving a ticket because if you are
giving 50 percent tickets there is no
need for women's reservation bill at all
so I think what I want to ask this
question to all the party leaders what
is stopping you from giving tickets to
women don't tell us there are no women
there plenty and plethora most of us are
here so please tell us what is stopping
basically the male hierarchy which is
which do not want the real woman into
power because when women is in power
they will be thinking about drinking
water they'll be thinking about food but
when men Mandy is in power they'll be
thinking about meto
everything about air force so when the
real basic thing they have they'll be
improving by women are in power while
all political parties have female
membership women are mostly confined to
the women's wings and used to mobilize
female voters they end up getting
ceremonial and administrative roles
within the party organization but very
few make it to the top echelon serve
either the party or the government at
their parties in power project Shakti is
reaching out to women MPs and MLAs
cutting across party lines to address
this challenge this is not an easy
battle because this is a problem that is
existed since the first day of democracy
in the first Parliament we had about 24
or so women elected and now we have 64
right 22 to 64 so we've increased only
by 42 women in about 67 years in other
words if you don't do anything at all
right you're not even adding one more
woman to Parliament each year you're not
even adding one more woman to Parliament
each year right so Shakti realizes that
we have to span the gamut of creating
awareness and educating voters on this
working with political parties hand and
both to pressure them and you know
request them and to petition them to
giving more tickets to women and
fielding more women putting more women
in positions of power even within the
parties they don't hold positions of
power and we need to work with the party
women to understand you know from the
inside how to change that system there
are exceptions though in Karnataka local
government bodies like the Bengaluru
Mahanagara Palike I have a 50 percent
reservation for women this has been the
case for over two decades thanks to
former prime minister they recorder who
in 1996 also took the woman's
reservation bill to the Lok Sabha he has
seen it get shelved and believes there
are other ways to improve the
representation of women unless the
Election Commission takes some amendment
in the reservation in the parliament is
not possible the Election Commission can
bring a simple modification one-third
issues should be reserved for her there
is another simple simplification of this
constitutional amendment there is a
United Nations University report last me
has a study of women
emily's in legislative assemblies across
the country spanning 20 years between
1992 and 2012 the study shows women to
be more effective in improving economic
growth in their constituency than men
and also that women are less likely to
have criminal charges or use their
offices for personal financial gain
women MPs are more contentious skipping
less than 10 percent of the sessions and
participate actively in debates yet in
the last twenty years the best
representation women have received from
the two major national parties is 13
percent of the tickets in local bodies
where there is reservation many women
politicians such still just proxies
standing in for husbands or carrying on
the legacies of their fathers but
Marathi a congress cooperator in
Bengaluru who was the mayor two years
ago says
it is still a challenge for women to be
taken seriously in all the meetings in
all the made this we can see that so
most of the hull full of men only only
on 10% 15% were women
I even under stage also there are only
men are sitting under state only women
one or two are sitting on the stage men
only speak in the meetings for women
only
they make you they may not be give
opportunity to speak even when women are
inducted into the union cabinet it's
rare for them to get the really
important portfolios which is why the
appointment of Nirmala Sitharaman as the
country's defence minister made such a
splash Chewbacca and logy the firebrand
MP from Ruby chick McClure known for a
record 99% attendance in Parliament has
always fought against the relegation to
women oriented roles even as a ministry
when they are forming the ministry
always the woman will get two men and
child development or Canada and culture
or something like that I argued that I I
can perform in other departments I don't
need a woman and child you can give to a
male I can perform in other Department
better that's why I go out to rural
development i I marked their line in
rural development also Energy Department
and again and again we have to prove in
each meetings in each cabinet meetings
or in Party work always you we are like
a question marker
women can perform that's what that is
the question mark that is why I
struggled hard for to prove myself I can
perform in Department also in the party
ten years ago Karen logy proved herself
to be one of the most efficient in the
yet Europe a cabinet handing the complex
Energy Department but for the single
woman it has come at a great personal
cost the political families support
woman their children their daughter or
their wife or their mother or something
like that there is why we are actually
from farmers family I am from a small
farmer family serving in politics is
really difficult and I have to face the
myself for all irrigations in all other
consequences because nobody is there be
behind us two supporters for some women
even if the routine has been facilitated
by their family connection they believe
it is still away in Sony already an
environment and animal rights activist
was elected to the Karnataka Assembly
last year one of only ten women in the
225 member assembly shrugs off the
perception that she is where she is
because her father is ramalinga reddy
the state's Home Minister is day before
yesterday I was in another event and
somebody was just into using me by the
way this is the MLA and people are like
where and and then they say lady lady a
village so it's it's it's and many times
you know in a sense because there's a
lot of man straining as well because at
the end of the day unfortunately it's a
patriarchal world and especially
politics it's mostly full of men and
also people are not used to women being
assertive and a lot of people I feel
that you know they expect women to be
you know submissive to be obedient to be
not opinionated and well going back to
also your question I mean look at the
representation I mean we're very glad in
fact we have a reservation in gram
panchayat we have in municipality and
you know when I go to the every time I
go to the council I'm very happy because
I see a hundred and two women out of 198
corporators
in a Bangla BBMP
meanwhile for the electorate they are
keeping an open mind
wonder what polymer tell you every
funder an epochal a pocket the god word
for me no cash no Ghana in mclubbe
Arthur allowance or anorthite Olga mani
Nicholson in India market in Intel today
are they in McLaren a machine Asuka or
vertigo you know your Bodo thus the
elderly Gandhi say either a Mingus

separately in more cleverly in tanana
are separately
[Music]
if the legislation has been kept pending
for all of 20 years it only needs that
point to the parties even the ones that
speak of equal opportunity for women
don't really mean what they say India
means at least two generations behind
countries like Germany and Australia but
things are changing faster than ever
before women looking to claim their
rightful place in Parliament House now
the perseverance and patience of Shakthi
will have to bear fruit if India has to
realize its potential

Nadu is 2.37 good evening welcome to our
special edition of viewpoint in less
than four weeks time from now the first
phase of the big battle for 2019 will
kick off already the story of what is
going to be the most single single most
determining factor on the road to 2019
is being spoken about extensively it's
almost as if the story of Pulwama has
now gone away and it may not be the only
factor which may influence elections
2019 the Prime Minister has unveiled a
massive nationwide campaign of many
chalkie that what are we to make out on
the road to 2019 by the time you
actually hit the polling stage from
Pulwama to maybe chocolate our what else
are the other key campaign points which
could be flagged off on this program
tonight over the next one are some of
country's leading pollsters journalists
opinion makers are there with us
let me start with a quick introduction
my colleague from our sister publication
first Post editor of first world be me
route keeps a very close tab on
everything that unfolds within southern
parts of the country next to him so Jim
Paula suji's Bella believes that the
story of India is a story of Moody the
story of India is the story of rise of
India's economy is to achieve a light
majority or minority we'll find that out
next to him sanjay kumar director CSDs
he's also been conducting various polls
all across the country and naita
app co-founder someone who started this
entire application brother Mittal he's
got an interesting experiment and he
keeps a close eye on everything that
happens across India also with me my

travelling extensively across the length
and breadth from the entire southern
parts of India he'll be giving us his
ground-level insights in terms of what's
really happening one welcome to all of
you
let me first kick off actually by
looking at the statements which have
been made by the key stakeholders today
from prime minister to his challenge
Rahul Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi's sister
Priyanka Gandhi who's on a boat ride
these days in uttar pradesh take a look
at what is being stated by the key
stakeholders

five years including the institution of
which all of you are a part you are
aware of it better than I am so I think
Prime Minister should stop thinking that
people are fools
and understand that this see jewelry so
that's how the stakeholders are speaking
out let's look tonight over the next one
are at the story of southern states
there is a lot of emphasis and a lot of
time which has been spent and what's
happening in U P what's happening to the
market bundle what will happen in Bihar
but what is the story south of India's
tonight
we look at Andhra Pradesh you look at
Telangana we look at Karnataka we look
at Kerala and the big state of Tamil
Nadu Post Amma is Tamil Nadu looking
like a completely different story let's
first look at the story of under Rajesh
and let's put up this graphic for you in
terms of what is being stated by all the
various pol agencies what will do is
that will ask all our pollsters to give
us their take what do they make out of
this broad trend which is being
projected by these these agencies speak
media on the 18th of February is giving
22 seats to join one ready spotty
seawater the poll which was done on the
8th of March 11 seats India TV CNX the
poll which is done on the 10th of March
and 19 seats news nation on the 11th of
March 16 seats times of earmarked 22
seats the trend that I see the trend
that I see is that Jagan moon Reddy's
party is the winning party this election
season
Pratham where do you stand you believe
that this the story of the story of of
other Pradesh would completely be with
Japan 1 ready this time yes no pain I
think I agree with that
so the neat app data we're looking at
around 19 seats for vias are and 640 DP
19 C 19 seats so the first number that
you're giving us was the state of the
state of Andhra Pradesh you're saying
that we're Chandrababu Naidu who was in
alliance with the BJP in 2014 this time
around you saying this alliance is not
working because also Chandrababu Naidu
is not in alliance with the BJP the
story's not working for it while that is
true I also think that BJP and Congress
will not even start off with any seats
at all this won't start off No so
because of that alliance wouldn't really
matter beyond a point sanity the
Alliance doesn't matter how is it the
German word Reddy has become such a
powerful figure in the state of algebra
I would disagree that Islands doesn't
matter and Lance does matter and in a
state where there if there is a
fragmented war but in Andhra we know
that there is no alliance and I would
largely go with what tom has already
mentioned why Assad has a lead over TDP
and I see why us are in a solid state I
think they would be winning races do you
say that the advisor has a solid lead
over Chandrababu Naidu first look at how
Chandrababu Naidu in alliance with
Congress performed in Telangana recently
in the Assembly election so there is a
sense also there is some kind of an anti
incumbency even in Andhra
so Chandra Babu Naidu is facing the 10 t
incumbency and Congress's Congress is
almost 0 in Andhra and that's the case
with BJP so this incumbency is going to
hurt Chandra Babu Naidu and people are
looking forward to exchange so while
even in Andhra Assembly vote as well as
in the parliamentary seat I think
weifare Congress has a lead over TV
Sudeep you view I see that you are armed
with with all kinds of documents and all
kinds of statistics so I want to
understand from you two very clear-cut
viewpoints being expressed there by by
Pratham and and Sanjay ji the senses
that Jagan moon Reddy has the edge is
your analysis is your mathematical
probability theorem suggesting a similar
story it does now I only look at I don't
look at cost in determining anything and
I don't look at the candidates in terms
of determining anything I look at the
historical record going back to the most
recent one
if you will the last 10-15 years right
if you look at the and I think what
sandy just mentioned I think that's the
most powerful influence in this election
is Chandrababu Snyder's failure in the
recent assembly elections that was came
with much fanfare and he yet quit the
BJP or the Alliance for the BJP and he
was putting himself on as a national
leader willing to take on the the BJP
willing to take on Modi and you know the
expectations that he himself encouraged
suggest that given his complete failure
and I think this has also affect crash
but you know what I'm looking but I'm
joking even if I have to look at the
broad trend again yeah across all these
polling agencies there is a gap of
roughly 8 to 10 percentage points as far
as the word share is concerned is it to
do with the fact that Chandra Babu Naidu
walk out of the alliance with Modi
demanding that he was he was being
dissuaded against is it that or is it
just a Chandrababu Naidu today's a very
unpopular leader the latter the latter
because you know this kind of would
share difference is very very large and
it doesn't we don't find out and there's
not that much difference in the seats so
in other words it is partly the breakup
of the opposition and lack of any
opposition so therefore it doesn't
matter whether Chandrababu Naidu or
whether why Assad gets 35 percent or 45
percent of the world numbers but czaka
on the ground on the ground is
Chandrababu Naidu such a such an
unpopular leader today and if he is why
obviously there is anti-incumbency
obviously there is a sense that he was
not able to deliver as was promised but
I'm not sure that all the anger is going
to him or at least the attempt by him
politically is to ensure that the
special status which was promised 200
per day she wants to make the BJP the
villain of the piece so if you ask me if
there are two states where the BJP is
proactively disliked as a political
party one is on the Pradesh the other is
Tamil Nadu and you can see empirical
evidence of
in the rallies that have been taken out
in the last year or so the entire model
which was being conceived by the BJP and
there were many who thought that ROM
mother would have a huge role to play in
building BJP up from scratch you believe
that so I don't think the bit if you
will get more than a handful of seats if
at all they will get any announcement
well there is no I think the larger
point is this the larger point is there
is I don't know how much resonance this
will have with the electorate but
younger Babu Naidu is trying to portray
an image that a vote for Jagan is a vote
for the BJP because this is the
prevalent sense in in Andhra Pradesh
that ultimately after the elections
post-poll Jagan and KCR will go with the
Vijay so can I get numbers your number
for the state of the state of Andhra
Pradesh Pithom 90 DB 6 y star 19 TDP 6
ok sanity number may be not six maybe
eight or 10 bits but why SAR is wise
that is way ahead compared to you so you
would go you would go with eight figures
now you go with I'm not saying exactly
19 right but maybe between 15 and 17
seats you need 15 to 20 seeds for wire
saw and the rest broken up I wouldn't
rule out a couple of seeds for the BJP
and maybe one or two seeds for the
Congress but it's a low probability
event it's basically a fight between
bias our and Naidu and really it's very
hard to tell how much Naidu has lost out
from the recent fiasco okay let me let
me then kick off the next state with
with me Meera the state of Telangana
let's put up the big picture of the
state of Illinois now feel again the
trend much like the state of Andhra
Pradesh there is a trend which is being
picked up by all the all the surveys
which have been done so far
over the last couple of weeks according
to one according to speak media 17 again
TRS width width wise RCP seawater says
16 India TBC and XS 16 News nation says
14 times of V Abbas says 13 so TRS if
when if in the state of Andhra Pradesh
is Javan one ready
who's the giant killer then in the state
of Telangana TRS remains in business
yeah it's pretty much it's a TRS game in
Telangana see the the wine Chandrababu
Naidu is in a spot and while TRS is
doing well is interlinked it all goes
back to the bifurcation of Andhra the
state of Andhra Pradesh at the time of
when the demand was there 400 vacation
people from Andhra said that what will
tell a ganar do it will it will die it
will sink it has no revenue it has
nothing it is rocks and right dry fields
but nobody anticipated Hyderabad to go
to telling her you know so this story is
reversed so Chandrababu Naidu who was
supposed to be the guy who deliver
Singapore and Andhra his miserably
failed it's not happen and it is Andhra
which is actually constrained for
resources its and TRS on the other hand
when they've got Hyderabad they really
looked after that place one of the
things one of the things which we saw in
during the assembly elections was this
decision off of the Telangana Chief
Minister kitchen the chicken also G you
know to to give input subsidies money
directly into the banks of a farmers
much like what has now been done by the
Prime Minister 6000 rupees per for for
all farmers with with less than two
acres of land is the central government
decision
but he's been out doing it now
consistently it has delivered results
for him is that what is keeping him in
good stead in looks about so absolutely
there was a brilliant move on his part
pending policy move on his part and the
correct policy move on his part in order
to bring in the income support and I
think that's going to be the trend and
it will really move ahead in terms of
lot more states the center will do more
so I think that policy initiative by him
will stand the test of history and
others are following yeah but I wonder
for the state election what's the
absolute I would bring in just lightly
you know if one has to look at the
demise of the Congress I want to go back
to their decision to bifurcate on the
Pradesh
do not forget whether you say they you
know the special status found the
predation not I have written then only
so this is ex ante that this was a very
very bad decision and for such a state
for this thing to be done either you do
it you should have done with you P is
the one crying out for separation in the
three states so I think the memory of
people is in Andhra Pradesh and in
Telangana is first of all against
Congress and remember Congress was of
power house in 2009 one of the reasons
why the Congress party got up to two
hundred seven seats was because of the
performance of Wyatts are in the state
of Andhra Pradesh so I mean in virtually
struck the entire state yeah and now
they are being swept aside completely
why well so I think why czar is in very
a Casey Rao is in very very good shape
and I'll be very surprised if he doesn't
get something like 12 13 seats out so
the softness which ties up with the DDT
for the assembly elections ends up being
virtually wiped out now for the loss of
my elections the Congress just not I
have a TDP in the state of Andhra
Pradesh fearing this is why is it that
the Congress has not got the story right
itself talking you in in Andhra Pradesh
I completely agree with Sajith Butler
they got 34 out of 42 in 2000
and they got I think 31 or 32 out of 42
in 2004 it is Aaron Sunday bar whose
book went on saying when my son ready
came to Delhi after the 2009 victory
Manmohan Singh said thanks to you I've
come back to power so it was that
influential Andrew is that important to
the Congress's scheme of things the
reason why the Alliance did not do well
in the Telangana elections is because
Chandrababu Naidu in Telangana is seen
as the villain of the piece he's seen as
the guy who opposed the bifurcation of
the state so Congress being allied with
him he was a liability to them the
reason why the Congress is not allied
with Robin I do in Andhra Pradesh is
because there is a feeling that if there
is an anti-incumbent vote and I am teach
and Robin I do vote if Congress and TDP
join hands then all of the
anti-incumbent vote will go to Java just
to stay with this story is to stay with
the story of Dylan data for a moment
because truth is that the BJP is betting
big on gains which are being made by
Jagan one ready both in the states of
Andhra Pradesh until now hoping the
Jagan one ready ultimately will end up
swinging towards the barrage in the
party why Sanjay ji what is this this
this bonhomie which seems to exist
between Jagan Wounded Knee and Narendra
Modi see look at the electoral contest
in answer up to this you have TDP TD has
TDP has walked out of the BJP and it is
very unlikely that they would have a
trial form an alliance
you have Congress you can't even in the
sleep you can you cannot expect Congress
to be doing something for BJP so YSR is
keeping the options open and they have
given I think enough signal that if
there is a need if there the need to
form an alliance we will be with you and
that's what is keeping that hope alive
for BJP and they NDA that why Assad is
on their side so it's a clear signal
advice that is not on the transom how
does your app how does this Nita app
that you have and I want to understand
this from you how are you coming to this
conclusion because I know that Sanjay
Kumar and Sergey mala have their own
their own algorithms and electoral
strategies political strategies how do
you work out your number
so what we look at is the popularity of
the Chief Minister as well so KCR is one
of the hottest urban that so on the app
you can actually just click on rate now
and select your cm and then give them a
rating here and so right now just from
the land
we have approximately 16 lakh people so
seems like you've seen like people who
have given ratings to their chief
minister right so if we take that rating
and compared to all the other chief
ministers right KCR is in the top five
along with mamta and others top five top
so you're saying across india across
india is not the most liked chief
minutes and KenKen
does your app also map out what could be
let's say that single most important
reason which is putting him in top five
that sure I think I think it's the
momentum of the assembly elections right
it's still too early to judge his
performance right in the new government
so you have to look at that but I think
it's the popularity that he has gained
after such a sweep but listen I'm sure
that sake but I will agree with me but
this is an app at the end of the day how
are you going to ensure that this is not
just a social media tool I mean this is
it possible that this could be a skewed
impression that we're looking at sure I
think how do you correct that shut the
app in itself is just a way to look at
the data when we go and collect the data
we actually go door-to-door we call
deeper we make sure that rural urban
people are equally represented we look
we look at the fact that the older
people the younger people are
proportionately represented so that sort
of sample correction we have to do the
app is just a way to gather but you show
you so you go by this you go by this
string the jerk that kasya the TRS boss
is according to use is one of the most
popular election performance he got
nicely seized which is a two-thirds
majority so he's more popular today than
he was in 2009 Congress this is not a
Congress Toria
there would be a huge gap between number
one and number two and you won't be we
won't should be surprised if almost all
the seed goes to TRS
I am saying almost almost as I was going
to say that during the assembly
elections whole lot of people were
confused about where the election was
going in telling are not right sitting
here I was very confident it was going
to be a complete sweep only based on I'm
not a safale gist only based on one
experience which is that my
mother-in-law's maidservant every month
she took two days to go to her village
to take delivery of the money and invest
it and come back okay so I knew this was
working so there at that multi support
yes which is been given yeah my kitchen
the sugar rock yeah using
has the potential of creating a complete
sweep for the deal which basically will
mean that it would be a huge comfort
factor also look at one figure last five
years TRS is the in telangana the
government doled out lots and lots of
welfare scheme exact number of else's
exactly which people like P it actually
reach to the people yeah so that's what
would you stop TRS and I remember
distinctly Zartha that when the Assembly
election results that come out K through
the Rao wanted to create this
non-congress non-bjp front the subsidy
no se was also reached out to what
happened to that I think it's a
non-starter I think they quickly realize
at least the other opposition parties
very quickly realized the mumtaz of the
world that he's not somebody that they
can they can bank on as a yeah as long
as Chandrababu is there along with mamta
and the rest of the opposition I don't
think there's going to be please so TRS
let's let's all be in consensus that TRS
is in the India basket well almost my
hood with you my advice if a JP is
looking for seats from Andhra and
Telangana not because they'll get seeds
directly what would your number for the
secret Alana for for for TRS TRS I've
got about twelve to thirty twelve to
thirteen alright so you won't be
surprised if they go ahead with you so
totally seventeen seventeen slightly out
of 13 maybe 14 or 50 maybe fourteen
fifteen so you stand by a point that the
Congress at best is in a one to two
seizures yes and your what is what was
your sample size that we were talking
about we are looking at 14:40 RS 1440
and the margins here are quite heavy so
the winning margin that TRS has in these
fourteen
constituents is quite large like what is
it what is small its price is small the
percentage would be more than ten
percent more than ten thousand percent
difference we are talking about between
the first in the second Wow if that is
it then I'm saying 17 17 out of 17 well
I mean if the gap if the gap is quite a
legitimate challenge there is there is a
trend there is no there is a trend which
is in capturing Osaka said if you look
at the assembly that was a big surprise
we were there discussing
which is the none of us expected PRS
party and cases on the run
administer well let's look at Indian
government's state government central
governments have been known for decades
try 70 years for dishing out goodies
whether in election year or otherwise
okay what is different this time is
there is actual delivery versus non
kvass them to my fulsome Sakina their
vehicle and that is a reason why big
story of course and for the BJP for
various schemes and they have all right
it's not spoken about of Telangana
government is that realizing that shell
Hyderabad is the cash cow he has
actually ensured that there is the
Hyderabad and surrounds is crime free
literally totally he's modernized police
to the extent that the Hyderabad police
is the one that is giving intelligence
inputs as far as into Assam and other
places let's move on to the next thing
so the consensus the consensus that I
have and we got numbers so Mora
pollsters here state of Telangana much
like the state of Andhra Pradesh not
giving good news for the Congress party
let's go on to the next state the state
of Tamil Nadu and Jacques spends a lot
of his time in Chennai raga the state of
Tamil Nadu let's put up the big number
first and it's an interesting trend if
you in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh the
trend was decisively in favor of a
particular political party in Tamil Nadu
it's interesting that the trend is in
favor of a particular political alliance
now Tamil Nadu is the state we've all
seen it moves in cycles it swings in
cycles one election with the DMK one
election with the AIADMK last election
was busy the a AIADMK what's the story
of alliances the story of alliances this
is the Congress is with the DMK the BJP
is with the a AIADMK and the a AIADMK
has got an alliance with in DMDK now
saga this picture that I am looking at
where it's almost I won't say a virtual
sweep but a clear-cut decisive edge for
this song this plus DMK alliance in
Tamil Nadu why would you go by that I
think so I wouldn't put a number it's
not my job
for numbers due to how the state will
eventually vote but Tom Bernard has had
a history of swinging one way or the
other so in 2004 it was 39 0 in 2009
despite relative unpopularity of the
Congress and the DMK they still came
back when I think 23 seats or so in 2014
it was 37 or to the ADM we got 37 out of
39 so it will be a one-way swing it will
be decisive I think it'll be 30 plus in
favor of DMK Congress yeah but may I
just add and I want to temper this
because on the other side you have at
least on paper an alliance that is
formidable as far as cost arithmetic is
concerned no it's a question of
arithmetic versus chemistry in some
elections arithmetic wins in some
elections chemistry no but being that
this is the first election when there is
no AMA you know there is no and no
currently so now there is solid on one
side and there is you know this EPS
versus o-p-s battle which which forever
weighted reaches on with the idea MIT
does it have potential of impacting the
results to me these what I call polls
are under estimating the EPS o-p-s few
yeah not not the feud the the way they
have stayed for nearly two years now
this government should have kind of
disappeared long time ago if Stalin was
the kind of a leader that we are saying
that he is going to get 34 seats he
would have thrown this government out
long time ago the fact that is not being
able to make a dent into that government
which is at its weakest there's no jll
data there's no shashikala there's no
even dinner current in that grouping now
right as long as Jessica law was there
at least you had something there if this
person has been able to hold it together
for two years I think there is some
element of underestimate these mullahs
scribbling something I want to see I
want to see what is Sujit scribbling at
first point that I've written yes we do
apologies to zakah etc I think the
conclusion that which is based very
accurately on historical record of the
the vote in Tamil Nadu is swinging one
way and the other is it just a bit too
cute
just a bit too just a bit too cute and
he held himself and Sokka it was the
last time
when it plays a cough that's why I'm
saying it's a bit too cute that history
will repeat itself identically and I was
going to bring in when you head to
yourself very nicely by saying that the
margin off on paper it's huge
now and you correctly said that look it
depends on whether it's chemistry or
arithmetic I'm afraid
the chemistry part is not there no
chemistry because economy is not the
edge is not there no so so are you
saying that Rahul Gandhi claims if
people if people are angry against an
incumbent government then that's
chemistry because it will benefit the
opposition he doesn't necessarily have a
figure on the other side absolutely we
always have and that's the well-known
and incumbency factor for whatever
reason there is there tamilnadu actually
historically has been quite successful
in the delivery of its are you we want
to say that BJP plus a AIADMK plus DM DK
has the potential of bettering this line
I saw what I waitin here is do not
underestimate the NBA ok I want to look
at that so do not underestimate the
alright and I think out of thirty nine
forty or forty seats you do remember
that you said do not underestimate the
BJP Roger Sanchez discredit modification
you drive waiting for me so you saying
don't underestimate did here India
alright Sonny would you go with that I
will strictly go along with roster Bala
but not to the extent that in India
would be do India would perform very
well but I I would also slightly
disagree with that that this is this
time we are not going to see a huge
swing in favor of one side why just
because there is no is that the fractal
selection also because remember BJP is
with AI DMK and Moody's personality
Modi's image even though we know that
BJP has no presence and Modi is not the
most far more very popular leader in
Tamilnadu
but his image is going to make some
difference to this alliance and India is
not going to be swept out in Tamilnadu I
would say roughly in their age of seven
or eight see them they are able they may
be able to seven to eight seats seven
eight seven to eight seats I have about
you know more sympathy on the other side
thirty on the other thirty seven to
normally this is what we see seven
fifteen to twenty even at least for the
NDA fifteen to twenty four the India so
you're saying almost even Stephen
Stephens almost even signed it can go
higher because of the math because of
the existing earth metric it can go
higher do not lie I think the mr. Modi
has replaced he a little bit or brought
a little bit of the chemistry in which
is not there in either of the two
parties that has not been able to
capitalize it is that I think that's
what everyone's saying in a big so we
are an art is a movie does the in your
data yeah
can you can you can we say this that
Prime Minister Modi in 2014 let's be
clear the BJP looked at Tamil Nadu as a
citadel which they thought they could
have breached in 2019 is the BJP
basically back to realizing that Tamil
Nadu is still a battle which they cannot
win the linguistic barrier cannot be
crossed all right let's look at the data
mr. Moody's popularity rating out of
five in Tamil Nadu is three point three
seven three point three seven is the
highest national average because it to
four it's close to national average but
the it is not that much significantly
lower so so so is that is that why so
deep you say that the state of Tamil
Nadu are you going very very high number
of fidelity ratings of either Stalin Oh
on the higher side more than mr. Modi I
have to just open it but you're looking
at almost three point eight six and
three point nine nine I want to know I
want to know in Tamil Nadu and that's
what I was asking in
since this is the looks of elections and
it is right on that is the word going to
be pulled as in the Hindi Heartland say
in favor of moody or against money or is
the vote going to be example the DMK I
think has got better candidates at the
end of the modern is a candidate who has
name and face recognition
Connie Murray from Tuticorin i think was
a brilliant move to recurrence whether
Sterlite you know the police firing
happened a raja from the deal the reason
it's it's about the candidate it's about
the party organization it's about the
machinery nuts also and let's not forget
why did a DM k get 37 out of 39 last
time because the overwhelming mood in
the state was Modi and BJP will fall
short if they fall short
let's back one party which will support
or which will be a potential ally to the
BJP
well of course history was different
because Modi in the BJP went way past
270 just put can I just put a wild card
on the table and I'm saying this on the
basis of some conversation which I have
had with some people is there a
possibility wicket of the DMK which
right now appears to be on the winning
side in the state of Tamil Nadu and in
alliance with the Congress party let's
say if the BJP requires support of 25 to
30 more MPs is there a probability you
see of the DMK jumping ship in joining
hands with the BJP post-election as I
said nothing is impossible and they've
shown that both the parties have done
business in both sides business with
both sides it's eminently possible
because Ghana would provide the buffer
so Jevon one just so certainly jagged
Monde ready and kitchen the chicken
route
tilted backwards the passage of the
party tilted towards the pathogen the
party for the DMK if the need arises and
you could do business
I don't think difficult to speculate on
that very difficult to speculate or
speculate
okay so let's get the numbers from
numbers from all of you kratom so you
are number for Tamil Nadu so we're
looking at DMK 20 ad MK 9 BJP for
Congress - okay and the rest for Saudi
MK you're saying 2018 Congress Congress
thing - so - so 22 all right sanity
would you go with that number no I was
13 I would I would not like to
disaggregate so much
you can alliances I think maybe thirty
and nine thirty and nine alright twenty
twenty twenty so it's a it's it's a
straightforward split between the two
sides when that was 2020
I mean you willing to go with that yeah
and in fact I might actually think that
will be better for India for the Indian
and your your basis of this story being
better for the India is just this is EPS
opium financial state again one is that
the other is what he mentioned see yes
Tamilnadu is uncharted area for BJP
right but the person of Modi will
actually make some impact in this
election because everybody realizes that
it is an election for the Lok Sabha so
Narendra Modi may well be a factor comes
some kind of support for all right
interesting
well I'll say this all at six percent
you know that's the other thing you said
can the DMK go with the BJP let's not
forget DMV is only contesting twenty
seats so even if they get 95 percent
strike rate you're looking at 17 18 17
18 seats yeah let me just say they said
in 2004 2009 and in 2014 the party which
scored phenomenally in Tamilnadu was a
party which was a business I think one
of the DMK has made the mistake of
giving too much away to the car okay
all right all right let's let's let's
move on to the next stage yeah let's
let's move on to the next state and I
think the story of of the Congress being
overplayed or the Congress being
underplayed is in existence in in this
next state also the state which is now
with the UPF JDS Congress Alliance which
exists in the state of Karnataka
Kumaraswamy happens to be the Chief
Minister and should be the big picture
Warner what is it that various polling
agencies have said it's a it's a nicely
poisel almost evenly split between the
two sides with an edge and edge perhaps
to the pathogen the party barring one
pollster the others seem to suggest that
the edge is with the passage of the
party in the state of
why would that be suji why would that be
I don't I don't get I mean you buy this
first you do you believe that it is
possible for the BJP to be to be to have
an advantage despite the fact that
they've just lost an election there in
the state of Karnataka and there is a
new government I think what you said
earlier is what I fully subscribe to is
there it's nicely poised and I don't
think either side has the edge and what
we are looking at is possibly 14 14 14
for the BJP possibly going down to 11 12
and the rest would it be what is it the
movie factors akka or is it that all is
not well between the janeers in the
caucus and we constantly see mr iyama do
you have ironed out their differences as
far as seat sharing his concern so 20
and 8 we know that formula
the issue is both the JD's in the
Congress us are strong in the same area
which is all my soul so well a will the
vote transfer because there Carter have
been have been at loggerheads for up for
a while it also means the 14 seats of
North Karnataka are not for grabs
they're essentially it's a fight between
BJP and Congress and let's assume that
the BJP does well there then it means
even Stephens
well if even if let's say Congress in
genius sweeps hold my sword it still
leaves about 15 to 17 seats open on the
question of popularity ratings of Prime
Minister Modi and you were telling us a
popularity ratings of Prime Minister
Modi in the state of Tamil Nadu which
was just behind the the regional
chieftain so to say in the state of
Karnataka is Narendra Modi the most
important figure yes he's definitely a
lot more popular and one interesting
more popular than HD Kumaraswamy motor
behavior far more popular than then the
Congress leadership Rajesh Kumar
compared - leader with local leaders
best yes mr. Modi's definitely more
popular relate to other states in
Karnataka but what's interesting that
after poll Varma this is the state where
BJP gained the most income in South
India in after in Karnataka specifically
in Karnataka or is this is this training
or three seats were swung towards BJP
side after Palama in Karnataka and this
sort of impact was not seen in any other
South Indian state so yeah it couldn't
be could it be that actually actually
this poleramma factor has been
height because I'm looking at the way
the campaign narrative is suddenly
moving from a issue to B's you suddenly
now this job may be choppy that campaign
has been unveiled
if the BJP was sure the despooler factor
is now pulling everything in towards the
package in the party they would have
moved on to this new campaign so quickly
does it make you believe that maybe this
Palama factor has been over hi may not
last in elections it may not last till
election but I am sure that whatever
poll gamma is going to do is to help BJP
gain more traction innocent vjp
it's only helping BJP it's not pulling
down BJP yes there are different
strategies of campaign and they have to
keep countering because I think Congress
was trying to hit hard on this whole
this word of chalk is are chalky that so
wanted they wanted they have come out
with a narrative which counters the you
know this whole loud voice of Chaka
Chaka Chaka ray
so they came out with a different kind
of a slogan which is more catchy then
maybe so does that does this appeal does
this kind of a slogan appeal more to say
the Millennials and although you know
all the computer engineers based in and
around back I have seen the ad and it
was very very effective and very
powerful but on pull wama I think it was
and we had discussed this what a last
week weeks ago yeah well it said there
was very difficult for it to last till
there what I think is going to happen
likely to happen is form the front pages
it'll be there underneath so therefore
what is the point about the Palama
factor is that for the very first time
there was a brave and concrete decision
made by an Indian Prime Minister on
something that has been plaguing the
Indian etc for the last 50 60 years so I
think it's a path breaking movement and
that people will not forget now whether
if something else happens what happens
etcetera but I think the advantage
clearly is there for the BJP and for mr.
Modi and I think they are two other
things I'm just happy they're busy
that's what I'm trying to understand s11
is
could it be that when number three party
which was the GDS and number two party
which is the Congress when they come
together and form an alliance and the
number one party that the BJP made a bid
to form a government the very
contentious build they failed they
withdrew and then when you have a
polymer kind of a strike does it make
people would have voted for the BJP
saying the assembly elections and those
would have water for the calmness of GDS
in the assembly elections is there a
possibility of those who voted for the
Commerce and JDS moving away to the BJP
this Lok Sabha election and is that the
trend that will occur quite possible
because I think they are choosing Modi
when I say Modi a central government
right so I see full wama you must
understand he's going to be a huge
factor in this election not not because
of the war hysteria he created and in
fact what what Paloma has done to Modi
is to increase the level of trust in his
leadership that this man is not a war
monger in fact I did a piece in first
was the other day where I went that one
month before 14th February studied all
his speeches not one mention of Pakistan
or Warren not one right so he was not
the one who was creating war hysteria so
the situation came he had to take a
decision and he took a decision that
actually packaged aggression and
restraint in the same place and the word
that and the diplomats and what that
does says even in states even states
with the BJP does not have a government
of its own maybe because of Bull wama as
we're seeing in Karnataka and because of
this magnetic charisma lapidus yeah let
me put it this way if Modi had not done
anything in the last five years all that
he claims to have done would these
numbers of help then pull wama if you
had went nothing would have happened
okay Pulwama adds to the trust level
takes the trust not a sovereign all
right so the critical XYZ factors which
now are being consolidated for this
discussion is this the X Factor
certainly in the state of Karnataka
appears to be Prime Minister Modi the Y
factor the trust which he continues to
generate this trust coupled with full
wama appears to perhaps take the story
of Karnataka in favor of the body
the party and without doubt the fact
that there have been there have been
skirmishes they have been these
conflicts which have existed between the
Congress and the juniors on the ground
in Karnataka put very well end up being
a decisive factor let's go do a break on
the other side of the break we look at
the other important political State the
state of Kerala which has become the
bedrock of a huge ideological battle
between the left and the right welcome
back time now for us to look at the
state which has dominated headlines
which has been a part of news cycle for
a very very long time the state of
Kerala what's the possibility of Kerala
being of any kind of help either to the
LDA for the UDF let's first look at a
big picture what is it that various
polls done over the last couple of weeks
are suggesting there is actually there
are there are there are there are four
agencies which are suggesting that the
BJP good will end up well getting two
seats they have one right now they could
end up getting two according to one the
UDF and the LDF the story appears to be
decisively tilted in favor of the UDF in
the state of Kerala so much of talk
about shabarimala
saga is chablis malefactor at all in
caelo absolute for the localization so
absolutely I think if the the LDF would
have done better if the elections were
held right after the floods handled
right after the floods happen print
revision stock was at perhaps the
highest that in hitting him in history
or he was being hailed as this as this
doer somebody we finally got a chief
minister who can act who can get things
done and a lot of people liked the fact
that he stood up to the center then
shabarimala happened and I think him and
particularly him more than the
government completely misread the
situation but that is not to suggest
that the BJP would be the beneficiary of
it
I think unwittingly so the Congress in
the UDF will be the beneficiary so the
Congress in the UDF wankered there was a
mature the prime minister himself at a
time when there was this question being
raised whether you can go in for an
ordinance in ayutthaya look at what they
did in in in Kerala the Supreme Court
was brought in and Amit Shah went to the
extent of saying the court should not be
interfering with matters of faith when
it comes to supreme Allah not necessary
when it comes to yoga is that a factor
see I think BJP as I think as the polls
also suggest if at all if they're lucky
they'll add one right but I think I
meant not completely agree with Shaka
there I think he's right about how he
handled the flood zones there there
would have been a completely different
scene but I think Sabarimala the way the
divisions have happened I think at a
electoral boot level I think it is going
to be really benefit to UDF because I
see this as a the minority vote in
Kerala is pretty pretty strong right so
I do not think that Congress will get
the benefit of that for the simple
reason that they really prevaricated
they did not have a stand that they
weren't even out on the streets like the
BJP so they were lost in that entire
Sabarimala issue I think it is advantage
UDF so ya know I I think it's advantage
UDF it's advantage you do hear UDF
but and and I think the BJP look for
surprised oh my god I think 0 seats last
time they didn't yeah one or two scenes
is possible so for the BJP especially in
ground zero from zero to one two to two
I think they are only looking their best
to the one in the bottom seat
unfortunately for them there's a pretty
strong candidate there it's just - yeah
it will be very difficult to defeat him
Billa who is the BJP state president
there is talk that he'll contest from
cotton of the turf shabarimala is in
butter of that depending on who the
candidate of the LDF and the UDF is that
could be a I mean that could potentially
be the account opening is not a story
I'm just trying to understand whether
Sabri mala in any way has tilted skills
decisively in estimate their both share
is going to go up yeah but I would be
really surprised if they managed to win
a looks of a seat from the interim I
think I think Sabarimala will add to the
narrative of Hindus being denied
international that supports NAL's in
Kashmir as well as in Kerala what the
wattage of the party has very astute
Italy done over the last last few years
is they've used that as a template
go in different parts of the country and
send that message across wondered um it
shall say when he went to assign one
question we may burn anything he What
did he say when he went to different
parts of the country poses Supreme Court
verdict in Shabri Malik or should not
interfere in matters of faith not bad
that kind of a statement can can end up
creating a buzz among selectorate among
the supporters brothers one point I make
here is that we don't see any pattern we
don't see any pattern that you know a
certain community is voting a certain
way or a certain age group is wording a
certain way it's very distributed or
even geographically it's not that notice
going one where soft is going one way so
what this makes us believe is that the
local candidate becomes very important
here hmm I think I think a lot that time
and again this would lecture this movie
factor which is a fact with which well
in popularity ratings they're a factor
in Karnataka number three maybe in
Tamilnadu but still there you're saying
in kala that's nice I mean in fact we've
seen very low participation from people
to read mr. Modi regula in fact my
samples in Kerala by mr. Moody's rating
is very low that's interesting people
don't wanna rate people people don't
care okay okay so let's get the numbers
let's get the numbers for the final
southern state from from all our
panelists starting first with you dr.
well at this time for state of Kerala
where do you reduce time one or two for
the Congress I mean for the BJP and the
rest evenly divided and I think no I
don't see 20 seats evenly divided
between UDF and LDF I would largely go
by what pollsters have suggested with
the various polls maybe between say 14
15 seats to UDF and five six years
2014-15 to the UDF 5 to the LD FN
Pratham 13 to the UDF UPA 6 to the LD f
and one for us and one for others all
right on that note let me thank all of
you for joining us on this edition of
pollsters viewpoint we've got a clear
picture of where the India story stands
as far as these five South Indian states
are concerned what will the story of
North Indian states of India heartland
that episode coming up on Friday for you
till then good bye

hello and welcome zowie actors film
gully boy has been blowing people's
minds let me tell you why blew mine
first I can't remember the last time
that a mainstream Hindi film chose a
young Muslim boy living in Dharavi
Asia's biggest slum as its protagonist
second with a great deal of empathy and
a very light touch
gully boy addresses issues of economic
disparity the rigidness of class today
and just how difficult it is for young
people to realize their dreams and all
of this it does by using mainstream
devices that create a very satisfying
viewing experience and a satisfying
outcome so to map India's heart and mind
today I'm talking to filmmakers way out
there
so yeah I really enjoyed this film and
the film that I've enjoyed so much after
a very very long thank you thank you
tell me what is it that attracted you to
the theme because it is a film about
class in India today about this yearning
inequality between the 1% who it seems
has 22% of India as well mm-hmm
what is it that drew you to this theme I
think at the onset it was the music it
was the sound I love hip-hop I listen to
quite a bit of rap but I've always
engaged the American artists in the you
know and UK but I you know that there's
been rap and hip-hop in the mainstream
in India but it's not the music that was
personal to me I've enjoyed it I've
danced to it I like it when it's in a
movie but it's not personal to me it's
not something I will put on my ipod on
my phone and listen to it at home no I
was editing the lyric me though and my
editor was also a musician Allen
Subbaiah showed me this YouTube video of
a track all offered by a musician called
Nazy and he was 21 years old and from
Mumbai cetera and he had an incredible
flow like he was completely legit he had
a flow and he had a writing style that
was really unique
and he was he was singing about his
truth his reality his life is the
environment music was the entry point it
was the entry point is the ending point
of today are you making this movie yes
so how did it become about class in
India today because that's what they're
speaking about thematically that's what
they are mainly speaking about that's
what the hip-hop rap that you discovered
the Dharavi boys be doing origin I mean
they have many themes in their music and
their different artists and they have
but like an overarching theme was this
and not just that it's also a massive
massive divide in our country it's
really naked in a city and the beauty of
art of any form is something that can
cut through any divide and this boy who
I would never ever have met in my life
there would be no space where we are
parts would have crossed puts something
out on an iPad which reaches me and
suddenly connects me to him in a way
that I haven't felt you know what I feel
is the power of his that is the power of
art that is it it just cuts through any
barrier any wall any past class creating
anything and where they come from and
what what is holding them back is
actually this so you if you have to make
a film about art artists that are that
authentic you just have to be honest I
hope you say somewhere that you know the
people in in golly boy are people who in
a sense are enslaved or colonized by by
their own system yeah yeah yes what what
did you mean by that I mean I feel like
we we are not doing enough to enable
people they don't have enough
opportunities there aren't enough
schools that aren't enough hire there's
not spaces for higher education they
know not enough job opportunities if you
are educated
there's not enough room there's no then
you're not giving them opportunities
they want to come up
today they're all these kids all these
artists are from the internet generation
yeah they know they've never dropped
they hadn't traveled they hadn't left
the country I mean you every artist they
knew their writing styles they knew the
difference between so-and-so's flow to
that construct it they know everything
about me they'd have educated themselves
through the internet so they are seeing
what is happening they're recognizing
the unfairness the disparity and they
know what they can be it's really in
their face how do you react if I said
that this is a deeply political film I
think all films are deeply political if
you ask me I think if you put anything
out there you're putting your
consciousness out there if you are even
if it's like an all-around entertainer I
will get your views on women I will get
your views on a community I will see how
you feel about homosexuality how you
treat animals how you are you know I I
can look at anybody's work and I can see
their leanings you know so I think all
work is political and people they should
realize that they are putting their
consciousness out there and people are
reading them so given that I do I
totally agree with what you just said
which is that every communication or
every everything that you create
suggests how you think of whatever
you're talking about but having said
that is this a political film in the
sense of a comment on the politics of
our times even because here's the thing
to help support my case your protagonist
is a young Muslim boy this is at a time
when the Muslim community is perhaps
feeling more vulnerable and they have in
a long time more insecure more perhaps
even disaffected okay you set it in a
slum so you're talking about poor people
you're talking about people who have who
don't have the job opportunities which
actually the government was supposed to
have delivered so in that sense is there
an overt political comment in this film
and that's very different from what
you've done previously yeah see it is
more than my previous ones for sure
when lino is all good about what the
subject is sure oh we're never a rap has
come from the streets it's done because
it is political if they are talking
about their social economic reality that
is the point of it nobody is telling
their stories and as Mira Nair's says if
you don't tell your stories will you
know they are speaking about their
experience how they are treated how the
system treats them and so yes if you are
making a film about artists that are
political that are socially aware this
is a genre called conscious rap so you
cannot say I'm not doing it you are
doing it you're very aware of what
you're doing
when I met needs the two artists that I
kept going back to who were in a sense
inspiration and so yeah yeah they were
like they were touchstones you know
because we gleaned a lot of details from
their life because you can't make a film
so removed from you without getting
nuanced and details and you know a
remind me really like to Maritain in the
space for a while and we interviewed
many people but these were the two that
just connected with us on a level that
was I don't know there was something
special with them and it was divine and
it wasn't easy
and we kept going back to them and then
Viviane Fernandez and Naveed shake and
they both members of what you call a
minority community so it was very
obvious that the lead character is going
to be a member of the of a minority
community to me because the the ED
because it kind of leases it it is there
as a subtext through the film it's there
so I mean there was no choice it wasn't
like oh like it wasn't that MC share
could have become the protagonist no I
didn't look at it there yeah I didn't
look at it that way that I find that
though there are many MC she lives in
the business as well sure you know I
didn't look at it that way I mean it
wasn't even a conversation it was real
it was that clear it was just talk
also having said that you know I've I've
always had Muslim characters so when I
was rethinking luck by chance beings are
for her whether it was Imran
for Harlan is their enemy Layla or
Katrina
in the NMD whether it was Farah in the
lair at middle and now just I've always
had lead Muslim characters so for me
it's not like oh I'm doing something
amazing that's my life it's but in the
current political context also but you
know you did you have used or remake
store I don't know what the term is but
you have you snatches of the music
muezzin with music or the remixed
version of that famous Kanako you know
former president of JNU yeah he's been
on the show yeah oh yeah on this show so
the point is that when you use that
famous speech as Adi and he talks about
as Adi from maneuver the as Adi from
pooja Vasu capitalism brahminism all of
that is that something that you where do
you stand on what he represents I chose
yeah I find it such a strong political
connotation of course but it is not as
Adi is not can he as sure it's kinda he
as one of the people that has used it
yeah and it started with Cam Lama seen
who actually got it from Palestine so
it's it and it was used for women's
rights so why can't we say it can come
Lamba serious you know what I mean it so
it's people are using it all over
they've used it for women's rights
they've used this against patriarchy
they've used it against caste ism are
they've used it against what you call a
military rule they've used it I mean it
is it's a Saudis word it's a very strong
word it means freedom it is mine as much
as it is yours as much of this Canadian
so Camilla bussines I feel that the film
is quite political in the choices that
you make and then some people say that
it's it's it's not political enough okay
in fact that you have used not you've
use that that the individual is
foregrounded and aspiration and your
ability to chase your dreams will take
you into a different caste category may
be right or help you better your
prospects and your fortunes or help you
achieve what you want to do or can do in
a country like India
do you think that that is a that is an
easy route to take that that is that
that promise of an individual reaching
out for himself or herself is that the
way things would work for most people
you think I know I don't think it's so
black and white firstly I don't think
it's about just saying oh I'm gonna
follow my dream and make it that's not
really the film's about the films about
art transcending class and that it does
and that'll continue to do so I think
that that is actually what it's about
but if you can if you strike a chord as
an artist
it melts a lot of things away and that
is the truth of it and that is what the
film is about it's not just about only
follow your dream that you know you when
you were making a film you want to speak
to the maximum people you want to you
want people to come in there and you
want them to take something away yeah
you know there are people that say this
is very political there are people that
say this is not very political I mean
make your own movies bottom line this is
my film this is what I want to say and
I've said it and it's connected and what
I want to connect what I want to say to
people I want them to see the narrative
of how we treat people very intimate in
our lives I spent that many hours with
my driver in her car and I pick up the
phone and say no I'm alone because to me
that person is invisible to me that is a
large an area and that is the visual
division leave airy beautiful there is
many things the point is you as a class
are being contained and kept there that
is what I want to touch and I want
people to sense when they are in the
cinema hall if I cloud this with this
also that also this was they're not
going to feel part of the whole you know
and that's my decision as a filmmaker
and that's what that's the point the
point is that you put how you want to
tell that tale and what you want to move
and what you want to shift and how you
want to affect somebody comes through
because you have to strip away that
stuff and go to the humanity of it only
then will it permeate you know if you
stand there screaming with the flag
you're not going to move people and
that's what I believe but somebody else
can believe something else and they are
free to make a movie
I just want people to stop telling me
what to make okay tell me why is it that
you chose Java doctor to write the
lyrics for Murad your protagonist I
chose him to write the poems because I
wanted the poems the stuff that he was
written all the lyrics he's in the forms
he's written all the part yeah
so I because he's the character is
somebody who is a poet and he likes
hip-hop music but he hasn't joined yet
those dog yeah so I wanted his voice to
be different from an MC Shane's to be
different from say Shakespeare to be
different from another artists oh yeah
he had to have a very distinct flavor
there is also when he had to convert
that poem into the rap track which
became the URI yeah that became a
collaboration of my dad and divine which
I think was just divine actually so yeah
I mean it was just I needed another
voice and then I needed that to convert
to that thought to convert to rap to
kind of change the lingo and put it into
another I found it interesting is a
cinema watcher you know how the angry
young man that a Java doctor and his
partner Salim Khan gave voice to for
such a long time suddenly I felt a saw
the angry young man again but circa 2019
in a way in a very different way and yet
in essence like angry but a gent lying
almost perhaps and even now you know an
angry young gentleman instead of an
angry young man is that is how how do
you react to my flesh or the need of the
hour then was maybe a different kind of
fire it's different
I mean like Salim uncle and my dad's
work was like I think really however was
larger than life and they kind of
changed the whole you know the the male
narrative on a level on screen but it
was very rooted and it was very social
political you know and there was a there
was a real nice and a authenticity to
the
the conflicts that he was facing and I
think the need of that hour was to get
up and take the system in your hand in
that sense and I think the need of the
hour right now is something else which
is you know I think I think people need
to talk more I think people need to
communicate more I think people need to
have more nuanced conversations I think
people need to stop being shouted down
you know and I think there needs to be
more openness and communication and you
asking me more out the more art yeah and
also is it also what to do with not just
what is the need of the hour that's of
course the large part of it but also in
java doctors experiences you know to hit
discovery of his art and your
experiences and your context in the
discovery of yours is is that also a
factor I mean that's a given
childhood and upbringing with worlds
away from here so tell me one thing that
that I noticed is that there were two to
two sort of plot tension points I don't
know I hope a lot of people have seen
this movie I know I know a lot of people
who have so I'm going ahead with this
and which is that there is a you know
murad sort of has this episode of
infidelity okay and his final outcome in
in the competition
he's not competing with AMC share he
sort of is in a way you know it's just
he's leaves apart in he clears things
easier what I'm trying to get at is that
would there have been more dramatic
tension and now I'm talking about craft
if if let's say Murad had to take on MC
share in the final because as a viewer
you're you're invested in both and you
love both the characters and the infant
infidelity
store story or the subplot or the track
um it all sort seemed resolved quite
easily former odd is that how do you
react to this observation I feel when
you're talking to 22 year olds the
result he's fighting villains very
interesting you know they are at the end
of the day I mean they are D they've
grown up together these two characters
they can see life without each other
they are their friends and of course
she's possessive but that comes with its
own history and its own story and he's
he screwed up you know and it just
happened and it was there and he went
with it you know and it's human and I
think he didn't like the way we look at
it is he didn't know how to face her
because he is lied and now he doesn't
want to go there or Paulo because he's
he knows he has to tell her the truth
so even when he's in the scene with Moin
Moin is like what are you planning to do
just avoid her forever because you can't
tell her the truth
you know and when he says I I did this
and I am sorry and you know she's a
friend and it just happened
I he's saying the truth you know and
she's not going to dump the love of her
life you know she'll handle it in a
particular way and deal with him is
really something I find it very
interesting that you said you know when
you talk to 22 year olds you have to
resolve things differently I mean of
course it's a generation do you think we
were if I can say we as opposed to their
generation those characters do you think
we are more stuck on some of these
things I mean I don't know about you but
like I'm talking about most people I
know they'll have a genuine solid
relationship has really not you know
whether a man stepped out of the window
stepped out and it's like a stray
incident they don't end things I mean do
you know people that have just walked
out for one incident no not really
exactly so it's not a generational thing
I mean in solid relationships it's it's
a solid relationship if you can't just
make everything one stroke you know he
said well they're 20 years old that's no
it's it's all part of it I mean because
he's young he would go at me in a girl
like sky would never speak to him you
know he is enamored it is magic it is
different you know and she is also
coming from his space and she's also
know hey I don't have a I don't have any
eye observation as to what happened but
the way it was resolved is is where I
was cured you solved in the sense like
you know it's it's accepted quite the
moving
one is it doesn't take too long and
getting back on track doesn't take too
long also MC Shan and he never go into
direct competition is that is that
something you felt that you needed to do
too
you know it would be hard on us as
viewers to see two people you put love
he unique I just did I you know for me
MC shared an dream actually he is he is
that person who we've had in our lives
who thinks the work is bigger than your
individual success and we wanted it to
be that character you know where hip-hop
means more to him than whether he wins
omerod you know if you're good you
should win and he's he's he's deadline
you know he's a Lionheart and he's that
character and you do meet them and it's
wonderful when you meet people like that
you know you'll meet people and then
they're so happy for your success and
you can sense it because they like the
fact that your film is out there in the
world even if they don't particularly
like you or they're your best friend
they like the fact that you made this
movie and it's out there in the world
and they are happy about that that to me
is very special and that to me is
something to aspire to be analyst which
is what MC shades yes here eyes which
for us and that is what I feel you want
to be which is why you like him now if I
had put him into that you know that
would have been the I don't know it's a
cheap shot yeah I put it like to create
drama and that's not what I wanted out
of it okay you know okay so yeah let's
talk quickly briefly about Randy's thing
you managed to tap into this really I
don't know what the word for it is but
it's just such a it's just such an
appealing side to him and you've tapped
into it before in the previous film you
did dil dhadakne a dough so um how do
you do that is that something that you
see or is it just his him acting to the
character you've created he's rising
dude I'm so long I it's nothing that you
have I mean he's just a very he's very
smart
yeah he's a very very smart
you know and he's a very sensitive
person and he's somebody that gets it
immediately you know he understands
subtext he understands internalizing he
because he is that guy he gets it he
knows what he's doing and giving him
he's also a really good actor and the
very few people that can react to things
without speaking in in a way that's you
know you get it you just get what he's
feeling and he's able to transmit a very
internal emotion very well and I don't
know I mean he reads he's read both my
scripts he's like both of them and so
does rific have competition where's
concerned you know what how much you
like him in admire yeah yeah yeah alia
Alia is super special she's just super
special she I mean I think every I hope
ever you like to set up yeah I hope
every director gets a chance to because
you it's like it's a feeling of like it
can be like this also with alia because
she'll make her write the baby is just
in the moment she's just so respectful
of her co actors she's just so she's
just a nice person she's just nice and
she's funny so it's not even like she's
nice but boring she's a laugh she's
really fun to have around you know
kindness in your film no yeah girly boy
I think I I think it's a where is that
coming from like I'm coming for my need
for it like around yeah I think people
just need to be kinder to each other and
to I mean it's just it's just been hard
it's not for us in the way anyone like
I'm not even on most social media yeah
you know my friends the kind of stuff
they get told and the kind the way
they're abused and you're just like
who's doing this you're sitting in your
home and saying mean things to people
you don't know where is this coming from
you know so you just I feel there's a
sense of you just need little kindness
of
I like the fact it's coming from my need
for more kindness around the world yeah
last year we you know we saw this sort
of organic social media led sort of it
you know it exploded in our face the
meter movement and different it not
surprisingly it started in them film in
the film business and we've seen a
reaction to it from the producers guild
from the entertainment industry how has
that affected the dynamic in the gender
equation in in the business and in
showbiz and how do you deal with the
work of people who've been called out or
tainted and you know how do you reassess
how you look at their work I mean I
don't even go back to look at my own
work so I'm really trying to look at
their work let's just be real I don't
even watch my own films once I'm done
with it
there's too much in the world to see I
think it's been I think it's been very
good to have this come out to to have
this conversation open to have people
suddenly become very aware of behavior
that can be appropriate or inappropriate
of course the larger things you know
that this was out of line and you
shouldn't be doing this but it's the
little stuff it's the everyday stuff you
know it's that everyday sexism that just
goes unchecked that gives you a feeling
of like that okay
must be okay you know that kind of thing
I think that that being opened up and
that little little that those details
being talked about makes the bigger
stuff so unimaginable immediately you
know so I think it's very good I think
production houses are getting
responsible about how they treat women
in their offices on their sets you can't
mess around and I think men like a
couple of things have happened I think
there's been a formation of a girls club
which was very needed very very needed I
think that's come in to front I think
women got up and you know what took up
for each other and I think that was
amazing to happen and I hope that never
stops I think there was a shifting of
shame suddenly you didn't feel
embarrassed you know and it became the
guys problem and I think that's
something that should stop either that
shifting of shame and I think what I
found remarkable was the earth was the
excruciating
creating detail of the act you know on
the crime in some cases and you just
read it and then you can't unread what
you've read you know so it so you've
you've shifted the game and you nobody
can turn their eyes away from that so I
realize that the they don't need to be
embarrassed
it's it's like you know if someone Rob's
you or someone you know comes in
snatches your purse
yeah it's literally like it's assault
yeah you know it's it's it's assault and
it's don't be embarrassed about to just
say it and I think that that has really
helped and I think there is an awareness
and the conversation has started and I
don't think it's gonna you can't take
that back
it's only gonna go ahead when you look
at your body of work your body of so far
how you look at the body
but what a lovely body of work when
you're looking at it and when you see it
from the perch of just you know the
gully boy release how are you how are
you assessing where you're coming both
in terms of craft and in terms of what
you're saying the story your stories
your putting and I want to tell all
kinds of stories yeah I want to work in
many many genres and I like watching and
that appeal to me
I want to eventually like what I want to
be able to look at a movie and be like
that's perfect my movie yeah I want to
look at my movie and I'm like I wouldn't
change was one thing yeah and that's
currently what what in what percentage
of things you want to change depends
different films different things you
know I don't never tell you but if I
have to tell you the film have come
closest to fine perfectly fine like yeah
the closest said okay I said how to do
this and I did this was love stories
okay the closer is taking it but that is
what I want I want to do all kinds of
stories I want to walk all over the
globe eventually yeah but I want for my
personal growth I want that one film
that I can look at and be like not one I
think what you know you talked about
working all over the globe you
we are you just released made in heaven
which is going to go all over the globe
on OTT on video streaming on on Amazon
Prime on video streaming is it like
greatly unshackling or liberating this
what video streaming is offering you as
a storyteller you know in terms of the
fact that it's freer the fact that it
gives you a global oh yeah it's very
different there are different things
that come with different moments of
course see the thing is you have you
have ideas as a storyteller that will
lend itself to a short film you have
ideas that don't want to make features
with you and you know you want that
masked here to kill release and you want
that and then when the ideas that are
just good for a long format characters
that need to develop sagas episodic
content which on a level where in heaven
is so you would you you can take an idea
now and you can be like I can do this
with it or that with it or that put it
so your options have opened up and
that's amazing then you have a platform
that works with you that is global
that's in 22 countries and territories
yeah so you're available so you will at
some point start finding new audiences
you will find new or detract exciting
yeah of course it's exciting you don't
have to deal with censorship beyond a
point not that you can go crazy you know

this was the same bridge that terrorists
Osmel Kasab used to escape from CST
station during the 26/11 attacks senior
police officials the fire brigade and a
team of the National Disaster Response
Force were rushed to the site of the
accident
this was the third such tragedy in less
than 18 months in the city
joining us now allegedly from the BMC a
civil engineer and bridge in charge
Heyman owned a mr. hemmond owned a
welcome

me by my full name instead of Heyman
donde you can call me what my friends
call me
HD HD IC HD as in high definition high
drama no no no HD as in humpty-dumpty
but why do your friends call you Humpty
Dumpty because the bridges I have built

Dumpty sat on a wall Humpty Dumpty had a
great fall
yes yes yes yes let's not make light of
the situation I will stick to calling
you mr. whole day mr. Gandhi as you wish
he has no sense of humor all right no I
do but there's nothing funny about this
mr. dónde I mean what do you have to say
about the collapse of the SI s empty
foot over bridge which is behind you
what do you want me to say sorry for
starters ah yes
we are deeply disturbed by this incident
and our hearts go out to those Germans
and their families who have lost their
lives in this attack
what are you what are you talking about
what are you saying
sorry sorry wrong speech the wrong
speech yeah we are deeply disturbed by
this incident and our hearts goes out to
those who have lost their lives and have
injured in this incident let us not play
politics over this this is a very sad
moment we must all stand together in
this face of tragedy this is no time for
blame game right right right but you
want to blame somebody then this is all
the fault of the railways not us one
minute you just said no blame game on
you're blaming the railways but you
build the bridge
you were supposed to bunt in the bridge
you were supposed to have audit in the
bridge are you not to blame so why
should we be blamed we have done nothing
wrong whatever listen listen why did the
bridge collapse the fault lies with the
railway they did not give us all the
information required what is this
information see we built the bridge as
per requirement okay then what happened
how are we supposed to know that people
who would be walking over it yeah that's
true that would make no sense why would
people walk over a bridge actually
Mumbai no one uses bridges they all walk
around the bridge
it's just points out the inefficiency
and the lack of accountability in all
forms of our government my good friend I
don't understand why you press people
make a mountain out of a molehill
it's a mountain out of a molehill and a
molehill Malabar Hill and top hill what
difference it makes this is just typical
behavior of the press what is this
absolute rubbish what are you talking
about you know I sometimes wonder you
guys have the talent and ability to
build anything in the first place please
speak with respect I have been in the
profession for 30 years I have built
many many bridges locally
internationally internationally like at
which bridges like the world-famous
Harbour Bridge you built the bridge over
Sydney Harbour Australia no no the
bridge over platform number one and
platform number four over harbour line a
rule and Karger
that's not international and that's not
famous of course it is I have also built
the Mississippi bridge you've built the
Mississippi bridge in Fort Madison over
the Mississippi River no no over the
Mississippi I done there's no bridge
over the Mississippi garden of course
there is Mississippi's garden is right
next to mr. Zippy's garden you know she
was looking rather complex are you for
real you know there are bridges in
Mumbai that have been built by the
British and those bridges are still
standing for over 100 years
no one which no one bridge cannot stand
for 30 years again you press people are
being unfair also how you just said the
British were given 100 years to build a
bridge he and he got only 30 years to
repair this one well I'm running out of
time wasting my time on you sir you have
any last words to say if you remember
this was the same bridge that terrorists
Osmel Kasab used to escape from CST
station during the 26/11 attacks yes we
are aware we are aware of that yes with
this collapse
we have finally put an end to terrorism
what everyone completely nuts what are
you saying this bridge collapse will
ensure that no Pakistani terrorists ever
crosses that bridge again it is the end
of terrorism Pakistan

intense emotionally charged and
dangerous reality show on television is

over last week presenting the locks of
my elections
I see nobody's clapping after what
seemed like a never-ending wait Chief
Election Commissioner Sunil Arora
announced the dates of the Lok Sabha
election he said every single day he'll
never April 12 April 13 he went on and
on and on we will begin on April 11th in
seven phases and the results will be out
on May 23rd will pass who'll fail will
get a tkt joining us now is a Ledge
spokesperson for the Chief Election
Commissioner Sunil Arora
mr. Anil Arora mr. Neal Arora welcome to
the show we're dying to ask the
questions thank you for inviting me on
your show before you ask me any
questions let me tell you the format in
which these questions may be asked what
sorry format
we shall conduct this interview in seven
phases did you say seven phases why what
what is game face one you can ask me
questions about other Pradesh Arunachal
Pradesh Assam Bihar Chhattisgarh Jumpman
Kashmir but let me stop you right there
let me just get one second listen can we
please proceed with this interview yes
so I would like to just at the beginning
mention this at the Thai will consider
this the second phase of our interview
what second phase
okay whatever fine but I'll start with
my first phase - your second phase let's
talk about the avians this time we have
made the provisions for the photographs
of candidates on EVMS and ballot paper
to make sure the water knows who he or
she is voting for I really think in
democracies people should know who
they're voting for
it's a good idea the BJP however wasn't
very happy with the idea of photographs
of candidates what are you saying why
not instead of the candidates they
wanted photos of Modi ji everywhere the
ultimate candidate for something
what are the Congress what are you happy
with the idea photographs no they too
were uncomfortable with the idea of
photographs of candidates don't tell me
they wanted pictures of Rao's on the
everywhere no they tried that the last
time so this is Rahul Gandhi the Oh
instead they wanted photographs of
Priyanka Gandhi everywhere as we say oh
nice bees so what else is new you will
be happy to note that we have eight
crore 34 lakh first-time voters in this
2019 general election through 34 lakh
first-time voters not including the ones
from Bangladesh
ninth row 84 lakh first-time voters well
done out of these ninth row 34 like
first-time voters 1.5 crore are 18 to 19
year olds is that a true fact yes in
India 18 to 19 year old men can vote and
decide who will run the country but are
not allowed to consume alcohol that's
true that's true of course given a
choice eighteen to nineteen year old men
would much rather stay in and consume
alcohol then go out and vote that has my
vote too unnecessary
moving on let's move to social media yes
we can move to social media we have
around several measures to monitor and
regulate content being spread on social
media yes everyone's talking about this
but how will that make a difference it
will make no difference so it will make
no difference how come because the
viewers of social media are no different
from viewers of Hindi and English news
channels understand what are you trying
to say they believe anything you tell
them alright I just put it out there
okay final question final question what
took the Election Commission so long to
announce the dates of the elections we
were waiting for the Pierre for the PM
to tell you when do now elections not at
all we were only waiting for the PM for
what PM for what the PM kisaan scheme
the PM or people scheme the PM poor
people scheme the PM financial scheme
the PN Road scheme the PM uh scheme PM
pension scheme PM highway scheme PM
Airport scheme PM trophy and
conveniently sorry coincidentally it all
happened just now okay okay I get it I
get it I get it
you have to understand the election
process is quite complicated
we were actually waiting to make sure we
were completely ready before announcing
the dates ah
so how did you know when you would be
ready to announce the dates first and
foremost we needed the dates of the
country's most important event but what
can be more important than the elections
the dates of the IPL
yes idea I know why the IPL is a bigger
event than the elections because while
the elections is seven phases the IPL is
eight phases Mumbai Indians Rajasthan
Royals CSK okay speaking of teams the
Congress party sorry the poor bugle in
the West Pompey Papapa that's just my
version it was actually much worse
symbolically they did it from Prime
Minister Modi's home turf in Gujarat BSP
chief Mayawati sounded the bugle where
this is the actual this is the actual
bugle that I reproduced there develop
what we call a blow to the prospects of
a maha got bun then for all by making it
amply clear that hub hojin so much party
will not have an electoral alliance with
the congress in any state to discuss all
this and more joining us now is a LED

ludicrous miss mulatto ji welcomed in

internationally
interestingly I get good spillages like
the world famous Harbour Bridge you
build the bridge over Sydney Harbour
Australia no no the bridge over platform
number one and platform number four over
Harbor line they rule and Karger that's
not international and that's not famous
of course it is I have also built the
Mississippi bridge you've built the
Mississippi bridge in Fort Madison over
the Mississippi River no no over the
Mississippi I done there's no bridge
over the Mississippi garden of course
there is Mississippi's garden is right
next to mr. Zippy's gardens in Oshiwara
local rather complex are you for real
you know there are bridges in Mumbai
there have been built by the British and
those bridges are still standing for
over 100 years
no one which no one bridge cannot stand
for 30 years again you press people are
being unfair and so how you just said

any last words to say if you remember
this was the same bridge that terrorists
Osmel Kasab used to escape from CST

of terrorism Pakistan muda bad [ __ ] you

CNN-News18 ...",2019-03-13T15:45:01Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FlFFS7CMRFc/hqdefault.jpg,"and the big election news is coming from
the state of West Bengal where West
Bengal Chief Minister and TMC chief
Mamata Banerjee has thrown an open
challenge to Prime Minister Narendra
Modi is saying that she can consider
contesting from Varanasi it is a
democratic right she is saying so though
she said that she's yet to make a final
decision what does it really mean for
the politics is Mamata Banerjee trying
to position herself as the face of the
Maha got Bandhan in her attempt to take
on Prime Minister Narendra Modi directly
from Varanasi but what is her
constituency what would be her
constituency like because TMC doesn't
have a water base in Varanasi does it
mean that she will be contesting on a
TMC ticket being supported by the
Samajwadi Party and the BSP is it part
of a larger gameplan of Mahatma and what
does it really mean and what made Mamata
Banerjee actually say that she will be
taking on Prime Minister Narendra Modi
from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's
constituency that is Varanasi it's
certainly a very interesting twist in
this tale sure about the MU Kapadia I
tell me why did Mamata Banerjee's say so
let people just in context the question
that was put before monta banerjee is
that there is a buzz in in DB hippie
circles that you know Prime Minister
Modi no choose to contest from one of
the seats here in Bengal as well there
have been rumours which are which are
making rounds in this and what would be
month of energies response to the
possibility like that if if I'm Minister
Modi chooses to confess from a seat here
in Bengal and Manta Banerjee was
responding to that question where she
said that Prime Minister Modi is most
welcome to contest from any of the seats
here in Bengal because that is
democratic right and and and in that
context she said that it's also her
Democratic right to contest from
Varanasi if it's required essentially
month of energy was not making any hint
as a possibility of course
from varanasi she was only just making a
point that even she can you know choose
to confess from Varanasi because that's
a democratic right and the Constitution
allows her to do so but she also added
in the same breath Maurya that even if
you know mr. Modi chooses to contest
from any of the seats over here
she also all through her true bhima true
the Prime Minister an open challenge
that all these 42 seats are available
for him he can choose to contest from
any or all of these 42 seats and yet he
will not find a place in Bengal that he
will be rejected by the people of Bengal
question that's right Maria okay the
larger political significance of that
statement thank you so much for Catemaco
path there for joining us so certainly
Mamata Banerjee is saying and telling
the BJP that if it is part of BJP is
game plan that Prime Minister Narendra
Modi
besides contesting from Warren se may
choose another constituency maybe in
Bengal maybe in Orissa then she too is
ready to take on mr. Narendra Modi in
his turf that is Warren se we're
shifting focus now to the story this
evening elections may not be a laughing
matter but 2019 polls are tickling our
funny bones as well and I hope the
politicians to laugh over it tweets
memes and rap videos the political class
is pushing their narratives and attacks
why are cyberspace their aim 15 million
first-time voters in these elections
with over 60% of the electorate below
the age of 45 we own rallies and press
conferences they are using the social
media tactics to move waters and sting
their opposition banking on the wiring
factor to boost popularity and
visibility Prime Minister Narendra Modi
is a social media juggernaut with 46
million followers on Twitter and the BJP
with 10 million followers our reach
unlike any other political
outfit but the Congress is going all out
as well
flooding the internet with rap videos
and memes targeting Narendra Modi over
his track record in the last five years
in this era of political messaging in
this meme ki Mahabharat who will come
out on top let me bring in my guess and
go straight to Weill sangmi he has the
maximum number of followers among or of
all of us we who is winning the social
media battle it's so hard to same area
because you talked about my followers
but my followers are on Twitter and I'm
not sure Twitter is that effective any
longer you gave the example of mr. Modi
is probably the largest following in the
world but look at it this way if you
choose to follow Narendra Modi the
chances are your head fan already right
so is he really going to sway many
people among his followers by going on
Twitter the real action is shifted away
from Twitter it's now on whatsapp if you
look at the BJP IT cells work they're
relatively quiet on Twitter there are a
few sort of trolls with 8 followers and
many digits after their names but nobody
pays much attention to them the real
battle is the videos the news all of
that sat circulated in India one of the
problems with India is that as
mainstream media are in decline and I
include us in television as well as the
printed papers there is a huge rise in
what's our forwards many people because
they're young perhaps because they
haven't had much experience editing or
whatever tend to believe that anything
that comes on whatsapp is true if you
looked at examples over the last year
you will know the number of riots
lynchings that have been caused by
whatsapp forward when it comes to
whatsapp it's very hard to tell who's
winning the battle but certainly the BJP
is better at it and they've been at it
for much longer
Aishwarya Mahadev again you you seem to
be playing on the BJP space I think Mara
one you know Mara one thing is for
certain that the level of engagement
that political parties now have on
online platforms is unprecedented we've
never seen this before and I think thing
agent is extremely critical what miss
mr. sang we also said that you know it's
not on Twitter and what sir but Twitter
is now being used as a medium to push
not only agenda but also a lot of the
narrative that is happening and I think
you know to be very honest the BJP did
have a head start but I think that the
Congress has caught up because if you
see the sort of meteoric rise in online
volunteering or even the way that the
Congress platform has functioned you
know I think even divya spandana has
done a fabulous job in actually giving
them some competition and we saw this
upswing posts are around not campaigned
in karnataka and in these states and
it's and it's yeah a Gujarat Karnataka
and these other states and it's a sort
of engagement whether it's volunteer
based engagement or even the content at
the end of it it's about what catches a
consumers eyes and whatsapp yes is an
extremely strong network of
dissemination everybody has that one
family group of propaganda if I may say
so because I have one and it's
constantly on mute but there are various
platforms of engagement and this is the
new battlefield but Maria we should not
forget that elections are fought on the
ground and that is the reality no matter
how much we can you know take down let's
see Narendra Modi's popularity online
you see that it's still what happens on
the ground that matters and what we
watch how that is not yes that's right I
mean what we saw it play out in Gujarat
you may have won it online but when it
came to real battle the Congress lost
that election let me come in let me
bring in a zephyr Islam now zephyr Islam
you know 2019 is being seen as a
whatsapp election in many ways because
you know the whatsapp army that is being
created by all political parties so is
the BJP of the opinion that twitter has
been explored already and particularly
you had the first mover's advantage on
twitter now you're shifting base to
other platforms Varia well these are the
mediums which need to be used by any
political parties to reach out to people
no we have no exception every party is
doing it we are also doing it and we
know that if you really want to populate
a particular message to the people of
this country
you need to use certain medium and this
is this we feel is the one of the finest
medium to reach out to people and a very
immediately and which has also helped us
in in terms of engaging them creating
traction between the people and and we
see that a lot of our supporters do need
it the information from us and then
supporters as we was pointing out not
necessarily i i come i while i and those
his views that reach out to youngsters
but today what's up is one medium
actually as the source where which is
being used or apps which is being used
by every most of the citizen because its
cost effective it's the devil costume
and it is very fast and the some of the
service providers and provide giving
them internet at a very very cheap cost
so this this becomes very easy for them
to access on a real-time basis all this
information and which is which is very
important for any political party to
send their narratives or information to
people and to people and oh it is
helping the political party and we feel
that it is a very good medium to reach
out to people you know mario that also
exists a fact that the sort of
regulation that may exist it print and
conventional television media doesn't
necessarily exist on these platform and
the regulations are very lacks the
election commission has now spoken about
advertisements on social platforms and
whatnot but the fact remains that there
is going to be a gargantuan amount of
information disseminated where the fact
of fiction and you have to realize that
propaganda houses that would like to
push whether it's fake news whether it's
propaganda or anything through the
mediums that have the least amount of
regulation and you realize it because
facebook and twitter have taken active
steps whether in suspending accounts and
whatnot that a lot of the focus has
moved to whatsapp because the community
standards that exist on these other
larger interactive platforms don't need
on whatsapp and also the fact that
dissemination is so pointed out this far
faster easier cheaper and also tends to
be shared far more widely and can
actually perpetuate an environment which
is unsafe before lynchings happening
because the wallet ideas of child
kidnappers and and I think this is where
the BJP has monopolized on this because
it was sort of information they would
also like to disseminate through their
boss let's do the postcard new slew the
my age with some hack days of the world
and that's why they're pushing more on
whatsapp now their social media activity
we tell me when we look at these
elections raps can I just come in there
can I just come in Maria no all I can
say that what whatever the allegation
has been made by the Congress person a
Sharia the fines no married because we
do not believe in lies and which is what
the honor the party president of
Congress parties mr. Rahul Gandhi is
relying on
he's totally relying on lies and
explaining lies all over and they are
using every medium will be there is it
on their speech or all the apps and the
and the other medium of communication
they are using to spread lies we do not
do that we do not endorse that we want a
complete check on fake videos and
everything and it's Groundhog Day sir we
know what is happening on that platform
let me bring in beer sandy we're sanguis
social media is a double-edged sword I'm
trying to understand when when these
memes and rap videos are circulated will
it actually lead to translation of words
or is it just for you know amusement or
fun
well the jury's out on that one because
this is the first general election where
we've seen so many memes and rap videos
but the real danger of social media is
not what is said directly but the rumors
that are spread indirectly if you look
at the last election campaign and you
talk Sato Arvind Gupta who so
brilliantly handle social media for the
BJP in those days he always said the
real battle was not on Twitter it was
things like vernacular social media
which is journalists we don't even look
at it was Facebook groups in vernacular
languages where they spread their
message and that is what worked for them
not often the message that spread is not
mr. Modi is good or something as blatant
as that it was at the last election
stuff like the Gandhi's actually secret
Muslims I remember some scumbag is with
me to that recently but let's leave that
alive let's leave that aside it's that
kind of nasty allegation that comes
without any kind of attribution that is
communal that poisons the atmosphere
that plays on with the mode of one
community that portrays another
community is evil that's the kind of
thing that creates an atmosphere in
which words word battles are fought so
don't pay that much attention to the rap
videos worried about the most sinister
stuff we know in the American election
and that is now proved beyond doubt the
Russian set up so many fake accounts and
affected probably the outcome of that
election we know in London after the
London Bridge bombing there was a
photograph that went viral of a woman
wearing it the chathur or her maybe
walking with a fur with an iPhone hand
and the suggestion was even though there
were dead bodies all around her she was
busy tweeting we know in fact that she
was actually calling for help but the
point is that image was circulating they
placed it down to a troll Factory in
Russia the danger with all of this is
that whoever claims to be somebody on
whatsapp or on Twitter is usually or
often
and that's the light that's the poison
that rural star yes so far you know that
exactly is being talked about that
housing the lakhs of us what's up groups
are being created Facebook groups are
being created just for this information
dissemination what is news for you maybe
fake news for others but the question
again is that can be JP ensured that
this is that environment will not be
wishes Marya as a political party we
strongly believe that no fake videos no
information should be disseminated
unless it can be substantiated and we
take utmost precaution to do that but
there are there may be four sub group Oh
must be propagating it may be
circulating it how many I I cannot speak
for them
any canonic experience
stand the test of the time is something
which may disseminate you know Maria
that's rich coming from a party where
mister peevish Goyal himself sent out a
doctored video of the bullet train so I
think it's extremely hilarious that
they're talking about how we try to
control fake news and whatnot and let's
also make it very clear that the Prime
Minister and several of the ministers in
the cabinet also actively follow trolls
and those that run news that vitiated
this sort of communal hatred and this
atmosphere of toxicity for example post
card news and nothing has been done
about that in Karnataka we see let's be
very honest the BJP stands to gain every
time there is tension between
communities because they drive that
wedge between communities and this asked
versus them narrative in Karnataka I
will give you a very specific example
miss Shobha Karan logic put out a list
of Hindu Correa Curtis would apparently
been killed but the fact of the matter
is out of the after list who'd been
killed by jihadi said she said
she sent a letter to Raj nut sing they
went hammer and tongs on that in the
coastal area only to find out later that
half fall at our lives some people were
alive some people were killed for
property disputes and personal issues
but this is the sort of narrator they're
driving on social media as well as on
the ground so the BGP should really
think within what sort of traction
they're gaining and what they're paying
for
they're driving this irrevocable wedge
in society although electoral games and
they shouldn't be preaching about how we
have very high standards because that is
absolutely it's like you know fallacious
to see yes so for Islam ten seconds -
and then I'll go - we're for the final
comments I think I think the congress
spokesperson and their leader should
introspect what they are up in day in
day out there what they are doing they
are taking and they're spreading lies
every day they speak they speak they
they're all their speeches all their
videos based on lies I mean there is no
truth in it and this is what they are
doing but let me tell you they are they
only those for a political parties which
resort to this kind of unfair practice
they would which party no knows very
well that they do not get the kind of
traction they want from the people we as
a political party know we have won the
confidence of the people and the
Honorable Prime Minister is the most
adorable the country so then in that
case were looking at online warfare for
you will ground it as more the booth
management matters more that's what
you're saying the first lap it does I
mean you know it everything matters I
said when you I have to populate a
particular message which is like for
instead of our achievement and if you
want the people of a country and
particularly our own occultation know
about it okay we use this media but the
Astra if the strength comes from our
would burn up our MOOC and that's why
our Honorable Prime Minister and the
pride party press is always given and
advocated that these these are the
people who actually ensure our victory
and if we all the credit goes to this
but
because they are the one who bandages
every single voter you know we every
election is supposed to be coming up
with new ideas do you think 2019 will be
about whatsapp election as is being
talked about this is the defining moment
and we will see whether the platform
itself rises to the occasion to ensure
that there is safety and privacy at the
same time as to ensure that this
platform is not misused
well money the irony is that the whole
idea of social media was it was like
your personal saxophone you could
communicate with anybody without meeting
any money or whatever but it's not like
that any longer the irony is that social
media is now about money you need money
to create videos you need money to run
troll factories you read money to do all
these things you probably need more
money to run without social media
operation than you do to run a news
channel that's the reality of social
media today as for the platform I don't
know if you saw Sony vinolas press
conference when he was asked about the
platforms and he said they'll cooperate
with us and somebody said but what will
you do if they don't and the answer is
he has no answer in America the
platforms have no clue about the way in
which they've been infiltrated by a
Russian and by so many other people yes
I don't necessarily mistrust the
platform so frankly there's good reason
for me stressing them but I just think
they're out of their depth they have
created a monster that they can no
longer control all right we sang we
thank you so much for joining us
Aishwarya Mahadev sir for Islam thank
you so much for joining us 2019 likely
to be a what's up election it's for the
platform now to decide as to how it will
really rise to the occasion and show
there is safety privacy and that this
platform which is supposed to be about
private end-to-end encrypted messaging
doesn't get misused

thousands of people had been out on the

wise against state governments action so
he says that this is an issue which they
cannot ignore and that this will be

they have expressed they are wise
against the state governments action so
he says that this is an issue which they
cannot ignore
that this will be raised throughout the
election campaign and he also asked the
election car chief electoral officer to
reconsider his decision and he also says
that we are only speaking about
protecting the beliefs that is what we
were talking about in shabarimala and
talking about this cannot be a will not
affect the religious sentiments of
anyone else that's right me too but the
BJP always saw this as a political
opportunity the minute the Supreme
Court's verdict on Shabnam ella allowing
women between the age of 10 to 50 to
enter the temple there was a lot of
noise that was made about this but BJP
obviously rigged this up it is very
clear from the beginning that they're
going to use this issue to make inroads
into the state of Kerala isn't it
immediately after the Supreme Court
verdict actually the state unit of the
BJP had also welcomed this verdict but
when they saw the protest that has been
happening in Pongal Ehrman in other
parts of this state they came into the
forefront and said that we are along
with the devotees so right from the time
they saw this as an opportunity where
they could make inroads into the state
Kerala has 20 Lok Sabha seats so far BJP
has not been able to win a single Lok
Sabha seat so they are hoping that
through this they would be able to make
inroads into the state but another
interesting fact is that BJP state
presidents Shree there until a while
speaking to us yesterday had said that
BJP had already declared that they will
not be using Shabri molasses and
election issue people know about it they
will make their decision when they go
into the polling booths today cumin and
Raj Shekar and clearly stating that
Shabri mala will be one of the issues an
issue which they cannot ignore is what
here he said yes Annie - as always is
the case if the BJP talks about it the
others will will be forced to it
automatically becomes an election issue
isn't it
even after the elective Electoral
Officer making this statement it was so
sure that this would be one of the major
issues that would be discussed
throughout this election campaign in the
next 40 days because obviously the BJP
would be racing this the Congress would
be racing this and the left would be
talking about how they are trying to
take the BJP and the Congress is trying
to take Kerala to the Dark Ages they
will be talking about the Renaissance
movements of women's wall the number of
women that had come out on the streets
supporting these progressive movement so
definitely this is going to be an
election issue among the other issues
yes
need to be with us we'll talk to you
about that in a bit from now Rahul eesh
but is also not joining us Rahul eeshwar
in fact the BJP says why can't we talk
about shabarimala the election the State
Election Commission must do everything
we can if I talk about Shobana it's an
issue that concerns people and this is
something we really got to talk about in
the run-up to the elections during the
course of the campaign two points ma'am
one you all know seven lies the
spiritual issue is not a political one
but at the same point of time we
shouldn't forget that they envy devotees
at the peace at the hands of the leftist
government the our grandmother suffered
lakhs of women had come out on the road
to save Abraham Olano son of the great
this woman that our state has seen in
the past decades and almost six states
of India witness protests almost no you
know you can't you know it's a matter of
religion it's it's a matter of faith I
respect that completely but please
remember you know you can't seek votes
on the basis of religion you're doing
just that the BJP is doing this that and
also saying that we are not going to
listen to what the Election Commission
has to say we will do what we have to do
the Election Commission has had to come
out and say don't do it it is good for
your home finish but your code of
conduct but can I point out one thing
when a politically elected leftist
government they said to intervene in
elitist shoe how can it not be
politically wrong everything you'd had
asked the state government to look into
the matter to ensure law and order it
was their job as the state government to
do it
CPM wasn't interfering it in it as a
political party but simply doing a job
as a as the government they in the state
of can be please remember we can say
that a partisan issue or a party
political issue but both Congress and
BJP supported us and if you are going to
criticize sweep and drive with you and
its handling of another issue that's a
very legitimate concern because this is
a social and cultural issue too
we cannot divorce these realities she
respects Election Commission for what
they are paying but the same point of
time you should be realistic enough and
there is that lot of nuances issue no
67,000 cases were registered against
devotees how can you forget that many of
us we know I quit for more jobs I wanted
to fight for Shabnam a lot almost twelve
states of India witness protests almost
six nations around the world because
protect yes be with us evokes the
cultural atmosphere okay it's dangerous
ms c'mon he's joining us as well he's
the state president of the BJP in the
state of Kerala is this not going to be
dangerous he's seeking votes on the
basis of what happened in Shabri Malaya
invoking religion this is against the
rules this is a violation of the model
code of conduct as well emma's Kumar the
question was for you hello yes
in Kerala as a major issue is everything
under the peoples are discussing today
itself so we are not not for the
election commission we are going a
strongly propoganda inch every month we
have 30,000 people serve under a host
for that issue so many cases are there
why can't the avoided for that issue for
election because this is the code name
of village in your sensing a political
opportunity is what your political
opponents have been saying for DGP has
already seen an opportunity in Kerala
because of Shabnam and I knew go to seek
votes on that it's propaganda says the
kerala election officer we have
definitely strong profit off of that
issue yet in recent era but it's good to
be back sir no it is not with not
violation not negative shootie 30,000
workers are
workers their kids people sir and
dropped all the tissue now Carol our
people are discussing on that issue
today sir
well yeah why that okay but it's gonna
be miss Kumar is going to be a violation
if you do so it's going to be a
violation of the model code of conduct
oh it is not violation okay
okay that's a position you've taken but
the Election Commission has made it
fairly clear that it is going to be
violation of the model code of conduct
and be with us a case or Asia of the
Congress party from the state of Kerala
is also with us your reaction to the BGP
now saying that let the Election
Commission the State Election Commission
say whatever they have to say but we are
going to raise shuffle Mela and that
certainly is a poor issue missus Suresh
hello yes mr. Suraj that question was
for sure the BJP says that they are
going to talk about shuffle Mela it's a
major poll issue for them it doesn't
matter what the Election Commission says
is what the bishop is saying no Congress
is concerned we are always respecting
constitutional bodies like election
division and others so what were
actually amusing has given a code of
conduct in the past chorus is obeying
always so being a contact we are within
the code of conduct of election
technician is concerned gender with
different because what state electro
officer is given in Direction is and
nobody will take up mr. every mala it
will be our money and and the meatiest
issue and that it will be spoiled the
terminal harmony so this was the
observation of the chief electoral
officer from Kerala but as far as
everyone is concerned there is not any
internal harmony
yeah problem is ritualists hundred
hundred years old rituals is there in
Supreme era where as well as the state
comedy stood against our rituals that is
we have it believers but at the same
time we are doing we have to we have
follow believers believers means every
minute devotees and also those who are
believing the earliest religious customs
so we are always with them from the
beginning every issue we are with the
believers okay okay
still we are going we have I would like
to invite your attention regarding che
io dia io the babari mosque was
demolished and concision converse is
going on every election election BJP is
using I and also other part is also
using idea again is to Congress party
and also iota they are using some of the
parties using minority votes some also I
get my note see what is the BJP and RSS
are using in Congress so at that time
case is very clear the BJP in the
Congress as far as the Chevrolet issue
is concerned they are on the same page
they say that the electoral office of
Kerala should not have interfered in
this matter and Shapley Mela is an issue
that concerns the people and they are
going to talk about it so for once sama
the BJP and the Congress really are on
the same page you know I believe it was
bound to happen considering that this
entire issue of Shabri mala from the
word go was so politically

political parties from politicizing the

warning now the Kerala CEO TR Meena has
said that political parties unleashing
propaganda in the name of Lord Ayyappa
will face stringent action for violating
the model code of conduct citing or
invoking propaganda based on issue by
invoking the name of the supreme sub
record etc will be a clear violation of
the model code of conduct and it was now
joining us up with the very latest from
Thiruvananthapuram Nieto this issue has
already been much politicized what a
political party is saying now after this
diktat from the chief electoral officer
issues something which has been
politicized and for the past few months
right from this I mean September 28th
when the Supreme Court verdict came
allowing women of all age groups to
enter we have seen a series of protests
we had seen that the BJP and the Supreme
a large mythology has been at the helm
of many of these protests there were
instances of violence women physically
stopped from entering the temple so
after all this when those papers going
into the falls on April 23rd supreme
Allah will see a major point of
discussion throughout the campaign now
the chief electoral officer stating that
this is a very serious issue and
something for the state here very
clearly stated that if you are going to
politicize this invoke tensions in the
name of this and there would be
stringent action that you have to face
now when we asked about how they are
planning to go ahead in this they said
that tomorrow they are having a meeting
with the political parties where all
these aspects will be discussed and
there will also be an internal meeting
and meetings with the district
administrations as well as the Fuller's
where they will see if any guidelines
can be issued on that now the
recently has so far reacted saying that
they they have already declared that
they will not be using the Shabnam Allah
issue for electoral reasons but even at
the same bread they say that but the
people of the state are aware of this
and they will take their decision based
on that when they go mobile so even
though they might not be using it right
up front after this but still this will
be one of the major issues for elections
this time yes need to stay on with us
since you mentioned the BJP let's
quickly listen in now to Kerala BJP
president shri there on pillai who said
that Sharmila judgement has raked up
negative emotions in the minds of the
people going to use that dictates a
country that Hobart mana is not mob of
JP stabilize it in the election fee this
is should be come from Oh what they are
not on than a symptom is a spiritual
person we are beyond politics and we
don't associate associate any political
party for that matter so in principle it
is okay but at the same point of time we
cannot forget the betrayal British
government we cannot forget the
injustice that we face with the hands of
Phillips curve and who was arrogant was
adamant and who when the both know
basically bulldozing at fault so we
cannot forget the pain you had to go
through her mother's house go through
lots of women have come out on the road
so if somebody mentioned the pain I
think it shouldn't be a violation of
moral core aspect because the case is
right now also in some Supreme Court the
case has been argued for and against
yeah we all concede that a spiritual man
wouldn't be useful Italy

you can ask me questions about other
Pradesh Arunachal Pradesh Assam Bihar
Chhattisgarh jumbo and Kashmir let me
stop you right there let me just get you
one second listen in the second phase
you in fact I have just this one
question for you if you don't mind
who are you I also have to bring to your
notice that your show repeatedly
violates the moral code of conduct
this will not be tolerated model code of
conduct I've not been called a model in
a long time how does the model code of
conduct apply to a show
did I say model code of conduct I meant
I said your show violates all moral code
of conduct it is quite an immoral show
I must apologize so I don't think this
is true how can we be immoral stupid yes
religion sometimes fix completely but
you have discovered some other show in
fact what is the 9:00 p.m. English news
show the debate with I can't remember
can we please proceed with this
interview yes so I would like to just at
the beginning mention this at the PI
will consider this the second phase of
our interview what what second phase ok
whatever fine but I'll start with my
first phase to your second phase let's
talk about the idioms this time we have
made the provisions for the photographs
of candidates or EVMS and ballot paper
to make sure the water knows who he or
she is voting for I really think in
democracies people should know who
they're voting for
it's a good idea the BJP however wasn't
very happy with the idea of photographs
of candidates what do you say why not
instead of the candidates they wanted
photos of Modiji everywhere ultimate
candidate for something what are the
Congress were they happy with the idea
photographs no they too were
uncomfortable with the idea of
photographs of candidates don't tell me
they wanted teachers of rouse on the
everywhere no they try that the last
time so this is around Gandhi the Oh
instead they wanted photographs of
Priyanka Gandhi everywhere these beasts
as we say only nice beasts so what else
is new
you will be happy to note that we have 8
crore 34 lakh first-time voters in this
2019 general election crore 34 lakh
first-time voters not including the ones
from Bangladesh
nine throw 84 lakh first time voters
well done out of these ninth row 34
light first time voters 1.5 crore are 18
to 19 year olds is that a true fact yes
in India 18 to 19 year old men can vote
and decide who will run the country but
are not allowed to consume alcohol
that's true that's true of course given
a choice 18 to 19 year old men would
much rather stay in and consume alcohol
then go out and vote that has my vote
too
unnecessary moving on let's move to
social media yes we can move to social
media we have announced several measures
to monitor and regulate content being
spread on social media yes everyone's
talking about this or how will that make
a difference it will make no difference
so make no difference how come because
the viewers of social media are no
different from viewers of Hindi and
English news channels I'm not
understanding what are you trying to say
they believe anything you tell them all
right just put it out there okay final
question final question what took the
Election Commission so long to announce
the dates of the elections we were
waiting for the Pierre waiting for the
PM to tell you when to now elections not
at all
we were only waiting for the PM for what
p.m. for what the PM kisaan scheme the
PM or people scheme the PM poor people's

were completely ready before announcing
the dates

are going to face stringent action for

citing or invoking religious propaganda
issue by invoking the name of the
Supreme sub record etc will be a clear
violation of the model code of conduct
Neto Raghu Kumar is getting us more
details she joins us on Twitter with the
purim Neto that's an interesting and an
important point that has been made by
the Election Commission essentially
underscoring the rules that say that
religion that votes can't be sought in
the name of religion but directly or
indirectly you can't really expect
parties to do that BJP has obviously
sense an opportunity in the shop lamella
issue in the state of Kerala isn't it
so right from the Supreme Court order on
September 28th there has been a series
of protests in this state the main the
opposition party is the BJP as well as
the Congress rating that they are with
the devotees and we saw the kind of
protest and the violence that the state
has witnessed in the name of shabarimala
issue so now the chief electoral officer
TR Mena clearly saying that citing or
invoking a religious propaganda in the
name of this judgment or the shabarimala
issue for that matter in the name of the
God Oh is a clear violation of the model
code of conduct and there will be
stringent action taken against them so
when asked what how are they planning to
go ahead he said that he will be meeting
with the political parties tomorrow
there are various other issues including
this will be discussed with them and
they would be asked not to not to
politicize the entire issue in the name
a properly propaganda in the name of
this and also in terms of any guidelines
whether would be issued he said there
would be an internal meeting first then
he will be discussing with the police as
well as the district administration and
then they will come out with the
estándar what how they are planning to
go ahead with this so this is what the
election the chief electoral officer has
said now meanwhile the BJP state
president has said that BJP has already
said they already declared that they
will not use a shabarimala as a
political issue but at the same time he
says that the issue is fresh in the mind
of the people of the state and they will
decide when they go to the polling
booths on how they want to vote based on
this absolutely like I said any to
indirectly the party obviously is going
to be using that as an opportunity to
seek forts continue being with us we've
also in fact have a reaction from the
Kerala BJP president either in Pillai
who says that shop labelled our
judgement has raked up negative emotions
like he was saying in the minds of
people listening to what exactly he had
to say
do you have already declared that you
get is not going to instead be that the
states are cut reasonably after that
shabarimala is not mob of hippie not a
rebel Isis in the election fee this is
an should be come from the people okay
what they are not on the Election

I'm doing this not because of the guy
shooting a machine gun in the background
the last kid playing my voice to me from
time to time you have the strangest
sound man called Malthus who runs this
entire business a whole biopic on him
later now a military academy that donald
trump attended in his teens said they
hid his grades in response to pressure
from Trump's camp they admitted ladies
Journal they admitted to this great
wrong and admitted to making a mistake
the mistake being instead of hiding
Trump's grades they should have hidden
him they said it I didn't see visa
granted and just to show how effective
Trump and Kim Jong Un's Vietnam summit
was let me tell you that North Korea is
rebuilding a missile launch site see 15
minutes with Donald Trump and you want
to build nuclear missiles Canadian radio
stations have stopped broadcasting
Michael Jackson songs this is after new
evidence has come up insinuating that
Michael Jackson may have been a
pedophile in actuality what what really
Michael Jackson maybe the pedophile wow
that doesn't look like a pedophile no no
no no no no no just because you have one
glove I mean come on what does that mean
that means nothing in door has retained

and I repeat this allegedly I don't have
proof
penis city is ignore that's obvious
although other cities outdoors
I apologize convener I said it and
pretended you said it okay there's been
just Pakistan Pakistan and Pakistan for
the last two weeks so let's move
completely away from Pakistan to
something completely different
cricket India Pakistan cricket and
there's one man who understands cricket
sports in general and the problems India
are facing in the eyes of the world
his name is SK money 43 time award
winning veteran sports journalist SK
money welcome you've been missing in
action yes I was away attending a
wedding whose wedding my wife yeah that
came short and fast and I ducked into it
oops
okay but let me get back to the
controversy at hand yes although I was
at the wedding I have never ever taken
my eye off the ball right as enough of
the metaphors let's talk about the
banning of the two Pakistani shooters
with that it looks like the IOC and
company are coming down heavily on India
yes it is a classic case of action
replay action replay you say yes we
cancel visas for the Pakistani
competitors so we took action right and
so the IOC that is the Indian Olympic
Committee suspended India from hosting
international championships
so they took action action to our action
yes so action replay that should we play
mean so what you're basically saying is
right now Indian sport is in a bit of
flux please don't say that
why not I got a call a spade a spade
Indians bosses in a state of flux again
I am saying please don't say that say
what
flux no need for bad language its Lux
Lux not listen listen is it fair to say
that in the near future we Indians can't
organize any world events because of all
this not all world events only world
sporting events model other world events
are fine like Naga three dandiya only
when [ __ ] Christmas New Year dance
school socials miss hot Cooper
competition you understood
stop on that please let's move this to
cricket now is it true that because you
aren't granting Pakistani visas we lose
the right to host the 2022 World Cup
that's a question for beige and arugula
Sanjay Jumaane and Linda Goodman why why
then because they are astrologers and
only they can see into the future back
in the day all fixing matches in Britain
and all that I would say they were not
anyway come on come on sk will we lose
the World Cup 2023 also will we lose the
t20 World Cup in 2021 we may but we can
strike back
remember action replay yes you mentioned
it in the beginning yes if action is
taken against us leading to loss of
World Cup hosting rights then then we
can take our own action and organize our
own World Cup action replay our volto
yes our own World Cup the IPL World Cup
IPL World Cup who will be the contenders
Rajasthan Royals those are the regular
IPL teams how's this a World Cup simple
by attaching the words World Cup in the
title of IPL IPL World Cup Joseph are SK
morning I worry about it I really worry
about India with all this happening we
can get suspended by the ICC obviously
you don't understand the world order in
cricket there is nothing to worry about
nothing to worry about really yes
ICC doesn't suspend BCCI then BCCI
suspends ICC oh I see I understand on an
aside sir miss SK money because you have
lots o pulling influence people at the
BCC I'm not saying ask them directly but
in case there's some vacancy for
anchoring in events like that I am
available so if you could just know they
have mandira bedi
and they don't want you or no Jo singh
sidhu
anyway I have to go now my wife is
calling I have to welcome some guests as
I am from the groom's side
fire but I'm cheaper than mandira bedi
I'm telling you it's beautifully too I
mean way anyway international Woman's
Day was celebrated around the world on
Friday the 8th of March and people all
over the globe got together to champion
the role of women's rights and gender
equality by people I mean women let's go
and see how Women's Day is celebrated in
India folks this is not like some sort
of jokey thing with any serious about
this whole thing because here in India
the moment is really gathering momentum
here it is a day in the life of
International Women's Day for a couple
[Music]
yeah I just want to remind you that
today at International so what do you
want me to do nothing I'm just telling
you well yeah I just don't get it if
there can be an International Women's
Day why can't there be an international
men's day as well of course is an
international men's day really when
every day I don't like that then what
then what do you mean please explain the
whole world sandwich International
Women's Day we will make t-shirts they
organize dinner
they hold seminars celebrities get
together they have panel discussions
women get together a great fund for
charity is dedicated to women's rights
parties are held shows of the form women
centric movies are premiered so much
happens on International Women's Day
correct
so what's your point International men's
Day celebrated like Woman's Day how
that's important why because there are
no woman to organize it yes in that two
minutes we have saluted women across the
country we have shown when it comes to
getting behind in the movement we are
first I bet at number three in this
movement with kunal with shaker and
canoes opening the batting for you as
you saw in that depiction now we'll show
an even better depiction which will make
you understand the movement for more
profound a point of view here it is
[Music]
darling have you seen my shoes anyway
buy shoes no I haven't but why don't you
look around the house I'm sure you'll
find them somewhere I can't find my
watch on my wallet have you seen my
watch it my wallet anywhere no or jonno
I think I saw them on the desk this
morning why don't you check that all the
day's could ask you for one small favor
what am i walking here one one second
one second why are you being so polite
to me today a big polite yeah
you know normally you're screaming at me
have you woken up cow where are my shoes
cow my watch and my wallet cow I just
thought I'd be polite to you today have
you put on the Giro it's international
Woman's Day and I thought that I must
change my ways I must learn to treat you
better so I'm just thank you will you
promise me one thing
will you promise to never stop calling
me cow why what about respect to women
and what about women's empowerment and
what about all your rights are - the
hell with all of that just never stop
calling me cow really yeah why because
we are an India Genova and as a woman I
just wish that one day I will have the
same rights as cows do
I would like to put it on record that if
the government repeats itself and comes
back to par the same one that won in
2014 I had nothing to do with this guy
this guy was thought of by Connie suka
alone and she should stand trial for it
because I think there's a limit to what
can be comedy and what is ridicule and
what is just being plain mean okay it's
not funny in the eyes of many people
don't give how it is to repeat itself
then tonie's who's a cow I mean who I
mean come on happy International Women's
Day to everybody
Oh everybody happy International Women's
Day to everybody
all genders to all so this is actually
likely some different first step that I
correctly
a hundred percent

widespread protests had gripped Assam
Anna the northeastern states when the
Lok Sabha passed the citizenship
amendment bill in January now this bill
that will enable Hindus Sikhs Parsees
and Christians to become Indian citizens
if they claim that they are being
persecuted on religious grounds in
Bangladesh Pakistan and Afghanistan the
locals feared would make them minorities
in the region now the protests have
stopped because the bill wasn't
introduced in the Rajya Sabha but the
anxiety and tension linger yoga tamuka

against this proposed law and if this
will hurt the BJP in the general
elections remember the region

Mahalo that suggests the tension that
had gripped the state a few weeks ago
[Music]

state of Assam makalah has had a history
of terror related conflicts between the
local population and migrants from
Bangladesh that borders it the beautiful
northeastern state of mahalia which is
otherwise a peaceful home to about a
hundred indigenous tribes currently
sinners in tension on account of the
citizenship amendment bill like in most
other parts of the Northeast
apprehensions of becoming minorities in
their own land has provoked locals to
put up violent resistance and even
threaten insurgency this handicraft
store in police Bazaar the nerve center
of Chillon is run by cassie's which is
the largest ethnic group of the state
comprising about a third of the state's
population they admit that despite
limited knowledge of the details they'll
do everything in their power to resist
the citizenship amendment till when
people from abroad we will settle down
here that doing large numbers so there
will be competition they will be copy of

means about price dropping and all and
we will affect our local handicraft also
because people will come from abroad you

the Cassie Student Union or KSU has led

some of these agitations were marked by
violence and kept the police and
administration on tenterhooks people who
started the troubles are those people
who are immigrants and honest honest
they're not cassis they're people coming
from outside they're trying to encroach

of what lies in store if the bill ever

pass I will not be surprised that Milton
regime will rise again in obvious I
won't be surprised and the moment
military regime will will will be this
we know the the law and other situation
police also will be died here innocent
also will be dies who know obscure they
will be implement entire notice and the
moment our power will be implement
almost all fondant fundamental that will
be suspended so we will have a civil war
life situation we will have a military

will be a very state of affairs and we
are going to face them just because we
want to protect yourself
120 kilometers downhill from Shillong
the mood in Guwahati asam's biggest city
went from tense and anxious to celebrate
read when the union government failed to
table the bill in the Rajya Sabha in the
budget session of Parliament there were
protests and black flags shown to be JP
leaders in the state even Prime Minister
Narendra Modi's visit to a SAN on the
9th of February was not spared the mood
is very different now but there may be
political ramifications this celebration
comes Welcome Party outside the arena
for the Royal International Airport in
kohake awaiting the arrival of mahalo
chief minister Conrad Samba and meso
leaders also seems to be a battle cry
for a future struggle at hand that of
uniting the opposition forces against
the BJP ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha
elections
anti-bjp slogans shattered the air
outside the Guwahati airport even as
supporters of the NPP and other regional
parties of the Northeast gather to
welcome their heroes back to Delhi
prominent among them NPP chief and
makalah Chief Minister Conrad salma who
camped in Delhi to engage with the BJP
to stop the bill from getting tabled in
the branches ABBA
despite the success sangman news that
the respite may be temporary it is still
in the Lok Sabha that it is only lapse
on the 3rd of June 2019 right so
therefore and the government does have
options to bring it in other ways right
so therefore it is a matter of concern
and therefore their political parties
are still discussing and ensuring that
we continue our voice our opinion
against the bill whatever happened in
the last 1 month over the bill how will
this you think affect the political
fortunes of the BJP knows not see it
will badly affect because see in Assam
if the bill is business bill is passed
then we told them then it will pilot the
process of Assam Accord and it will
restrict the updation process from NRC
accordingly the sapristi of medium we
also see it is filed in media court from
Maryland the people of nagaland see
violet they record all authority to push
so how does this affect their political
for today I cannot say it is very
difficult to predict but you think that
the popularity has diminished I think so
with the bill currently stalled the BJP
has averted a collapse of the Northeast
democratic alliance but not before
creating a trust deficit with its
regional partners only if the bill is
passed
then we will be in a position to I will
reconsider our stand out here but as of
now within the nd also we will continue
giving our opposition and not allowing
this bill to come in on the streets of
go hearty people opposing the bill held
victory meetings in broken - spontaneous
celebrations after news that the
citizenship bill had been thwarted for
now the rights activists are killed oh
boy who spearheads a group of 17 mass
organizations the protests were also
about reserving the essence of the
Indian state which is secularism
dissipation RSS itself is attenti for
natural religion for Indian s for people
of Assam and not his people so the
people of northeastern people of Assam
will fight against this disappear and
RSS they are going to make this India a
religious that we do not want this India
irreligious debt we won this India
attack euler's there and this fight
against the citizenship amendment bill
was a fight to make India a secular one
for most people in the northeastern
states the fight is against all
foreigners not just foreigners of any
particular religion
the BJP support of the citizenship
amendment bill meanwhile is about
offering refuge and citizenship only to
Hindus in a Hindu copper-kidd to
cericarica can say about this as a Hindu
nation to cooperate is making a position
yoga to be silly Islamic country
encountering a extreme religious
persecution Casali Italia who are the
minority said that country unlockable MS
society or religion how Islamic religion
has come a majority of my know de la
society there's a sense that pushing the
bill too hard by ignoring popular
sentiment may cause the BJP dearly in
the upcoming elections at least in a Sam
they knew it very well that if the
citizenship bill is passed in the
parliament there will be massive
violence protests across noctus and
electorally they will probably gain in
two seats in Barak Valley in Lok Sabha
elections and lose almost majority of
their 11 sits in the Brahmaputra Valley
so this was bad mathematics in terms of
electoral politics on part of me GP
there is definitely some other reasons
beyond as I am or not this you know
which prompted them to push this bill so
hard bra some chaos but us look Chef
Canada the Brazilian cotton Haj Agha
whose time via ham [ __ ] upon sat
election I'm look at India had Haram
look at observable aha Assam car Assam
is jangan gram Kazan Dagenham locus at a
biblical satay
you see the more than 60% of captured in
our punch at election even during the
time of the January when poor autonomous
country and autonomous Council of the
ethnic people particular type of people
own local election why poor council
hamanaka mela had complications arising
out of the efforts to implement the
citizenship amendment bill may not be
just political rally
the ramifications as well go hottie
based lawyer amanwe dude who's been
defending the National Register of
citizens victims says it is ironic that
the government is trying to implement
booth
despite clearing contradictions between
the two exercises the citizenship
amendment bill will render the NSA
meaningless because NRC was brought to
drive out illegal migrant who came after
25th March 1971 and the citizenship
amendment bill will legalize illegal
migrant based on religion energy was not
based on religion so it will render
complete exercise of the NRC meaningless
so there is obviously a contradiction
between this to the protest against the
citizenship bill have spread into the
cultural sphere even among those who
were supporters of the BGP popular asami
singer zubeen Garg whose song had been
used by the party in the last assembly
elections has demanded the Chief
Minister serve an under sonowal returned
the votes obtained using his song guard
is also offered to return the money he
was paid for it he says he will launch
an agitation of the need arises again if
they does it again will be again
aggressive till then he is expressing
his dissent through his music
so will this citizenship amendment bill
become an election issue that gets in
the way of the BJP plans for the region
well its former allies and even current
allies certainly think so we'll know
soon enough

violence and lawlessness has taken
center stage in the state of Uttar
Pradesh with goons running amuck with no
fear of the law under the watch of
Witter Pradesh Chief Minister yogi
Adityanath who promised Kannan Raj in
the state remember in the last 24 hours
what all we have seen Kashmiri traders
were thrashed in Lucknow BJP workers
assaulted a youth in Muzaffarnagar for
questioning the government and a you
people east officer in Shamli assaulted
an elderly woman not just goons in fact
even natha's are behaving like thugs I
would say when a BJP MLA and MP from
Luther Pradesh came to blows over credit
for a road project as we Prime Minister
Narendra Modi pitches because and a
tough stand on terror ahead of polls
this is a sorry state of affairs in a
state which is very critical in the BJP
scheme of things the state of Uttar
Pradesh which sends 80 members of
parliament the question that I'm asking
on the show will the weakening karun raj
under yogi Adityanath
actually hurt BJP is prospects in the
upcoming polls and joining me now safar
islam is the spokesperson of the BJP
Javed Ansari is a senior journalist Juhi
Singh is the spokesperson of the
Samajwadi Party Zafar Islam who is
running the state of uttar pradesh
you have any doubt I'm asking you know
that I'm the way you are asking I am in
asking you back that you have any doubt
there's elected government who is
running this running the government
there this is a good governance model of
course there are some incident which you
have just narrated those incident needs
to be condemned we have condemned the
action should be taken against those
guilty have been taken people have been
put behind the bar and this is the role
of the government that anybody who
commits mistake who commits crime should
be apprehended and a law should take its
own course and that is what has happened
and that has been demonstrated by the
state that is what is alleged son cost a
large we had seen unlike we have seen
there during yes SP where the state
patronage was given to those Gunda and
at least today there is a government
which is actually focusing on those
people who are notorious for anti-social
elements and they have been taken to
task by the state administration yes
there are some incident I do as you have
mentioned this this incident should not
take place but if not really in sync
what the prime minister says the prime
minister says that Kashmir is are a part
of India and these goons indeed they are
who are clad in Suffern they beat up
Kashmiri traders and then you try and
send this message that they are part of
India is this not part of a gang that
they keep saying is this not pushing
them away from the mainstreaming that
they are so much yearning well Maria you
are absolutely right and I am Telling
You on your channel and understand has
also have a spoken the in leadership is
absolutely clear the Prime Minister is
clear the state leadership is killer and
everyone should be killer if there if
anyone has thought they must get clarity
that they are part of us the brother and
sister they should be given every single
production beneath
so hypocritical
it is hypocrisy on your part not just
those visuals history cheetahs are
attacking Kashmiri traders in the heart
of Lucknow this is the reality of what
the pradesh today let me bring in do
hissing do you think whatever one may
say the fact is that in this particular
case within 24 hours arrests have been
made
my arrests have been made because there
was a very good citizen of Lucknow who
stopped these people and the SSP then
went out and arrested one person and the
other and then he put it out on his
tweet that people were still beaten up
very badly because the Chief Minister
uses the language like talk though their
MPs in MLS anyway are talking each other
with shoes various brands and then
another MLA today really justifies it
that it's alright to show your valour
and your you know might to the
opposition because this is not a random
case this happened in Poland share it's
happened in on now yesterday that owner
MPs were again hitting the various
officers and today the Home Minister was
also in Lucknow so there must be some
sort of an alert in Lucknow so how did
this accident happen yesterday and thank
you so much mr. sp but again when you
were really reviewing your law and order
meeting then another trader was shot at
and I don't think any arrest opinion and
bullish and attach it has just been
filed so it's perfectly all right
but there's a high do you think it's a
sorry state of affairs well Maria and
let me let me give you some let me give
you some numbers Amnesty India report
reveals 218 cases of hate crimes
reported in 2018 for the third straight
year
yupi reported to have the highest number
of hate crimes at 57 as per Amnesty
50 incidents were reported in the state
in 2017 and 60 incidents in 2016 says
amnesty report this is clearly worrying
NCR be reported for 2016 actually says
the highest number of murder cases for
Pradesh 4889 crimes against women are a
matter of concern I'm trying to
understand for all the tall promises
Yakunin Raj hygge NICUs Karaj here well
I consider amnesty report is nothing
less than a toilet paper that's all
because that's convenient
if the amnesty report had congratulated
you had said that Canon Raja hey no no
no amnesty repose is absolutely baseless
biased to the tool our government and
all the concocted story the story is
actually getting printed in amnesty
report so I don't give it any credential
amnesty report let me tell you one thing
and that is that should be then that we
need to debate I am if I am I am NOT
condemning that attack if I am not
against that attack if I leadership is
not making a voice against this attack
then you can recur and hold us
responsible we are saying that these
incidents should not take place
the Honorable Prime Minister has very
clearly stated but there are people if
they feel that there are incident like
you like this Jamo bomb blasts and you
know who was responsible then there is
emergency becomes an emotive issue if
people react then the government of the
day should tackle it efficiently and
that is what happened the prayer you
know we may criticize the BJP and I'm
going to raise that question again with
you
the fact is here that action is being
taken yes we were certainly hoping that
there will be a statement that will come
from the Home Minister because this is
this happens to his constituency as well
he did not speak but then action has
been taken by yogi Adityanath is law and
order and issue again in these elections
look even if law and order is not an
issue in these elections such incidents
should not be allowed shuttin chin
should not happen they reflect very
poorly not just on the government of the
day but also on the state as it is U P
doesn't have a reputation of which most
of us who belong to you P can be proud
of
so therefore the reason why such
incidents happen is because in the past
certain patronage has been extended and
you know this whole muscular approach to
to two things has given people the
impression that they can get away had
this action been taken much earlier even
in the first instance when violence took
place I'm quite sure that would not have
happened but having said that it's good
that yogya death Malthus acted and the
real hero is that young man in Lucknow
who stood up to these goons
he's the idea of India not these
thoughts he is the person I said I would
readily stand up and through these thugs
are a shame or a blot on this nation
will you call them a blot as Wells of
for Islam see anybody who takes law in
their hand anybody who commits crime
anybody who is anti-social elements and
do things which is which they put them
in in that category other one who needs
to be condemned with respect to whether
whether of his association affiliation
or who will protect them and that is
what it has been demonstrated by hostage
and apartheid no matter what you say
Magua kappa yep revoke APRA the fact
that there the government which believes
in the governance and which believes
that that safety and security of three
individual is the state responsibility
and water state responsibility is
something which has been has been
accomplished by arresting these people
and charges have been framed against
these people but let me tell you one
thing why do you forget the project we
have seen within Ted pattern during the
SP you Eve man you read knows very well
that these are the some of the incident
you know there is a problem with that
what about tree you know why I'm saying
because you're chief minister says that
law and order in Uttar Pradesh is best
in the last during his tenure than it
was in the last 15 to 20 years this is
what he claims and this is the kind of
imagery that Lamba please let me speak
Maria frankly let's salute the young man
who stopped these peoples from beating
these were gun dies of a particular
organization they are known
chargesheeted history treaters
and the Home Minister was in Lucknow so
yes okay this SP can pat on his back and
he can put out a video with these two
young men who were actually earning
their living and they are Indian
citizens and you know say that the SSP
is very much with us but really is
Lucknow on the streets you had a murder
just now about a few days back when you
are a chief military was holding a
summing cybertek of law and order
oh now your own representation is a
beating of the people Buland share there
was a young man Azmaria quoted who's
asking for a job and wherever they are
in slums up please tell your
spokespersons and your various followers
whenever any individuals of any other
party tries to go for a live show then
you are a killing that person and people
might get beaten up like you were doing
with this particular citizen of India so
there is no what about you you can talk
about SP but your goondaism is being
sanctioned by the chief minister because
he knows that language he is a man who
would interpret certain cases against
the IPC you know a student for Islam you
criticize the achalasia the regime as
yada of raj
that they were goons who had gone on
rampage what we are seeing is fringe raj
in utter pradesh the rise of the fringe
all of them claim these are history
cheaters who did this and then they say
k yes up sub kiss
ground before ahead kooky hum no mukou
state assumption here it tough message
on Acharya Nene for Vogue at uni a habit
ik Maria arresting those criminals is
not a tough message taking action
against him is not a tough as the killer
toy in the public domain
well now you would tell me I don't want
to but yesterday they were like we have
about there under the listen to what you
have said and I am going to come back to
the panel discussion

elements who are being given a state
pattern edge who are being supported by
the local administration everywhere
during UPA rule during a Samajwadi rule
in Pradesh those people have been taken
to task lords taking its own course yes
incident like this should not happen and
we must condemn in one one voice and the
state administration is taking action
that is something which is something
which we have to showcase that people
who will commit crime and will not be
tolerated as some that medicine they
would be beaten up the way that youth
was thrashed no no see if you are making
is just this incident as an issue you
have to see in how many a nice elements
are there in your body it is an
interview I am telling it is an issue
but this issue needs to be tackled not
only is the heavy volunteer is not an
issue individual was not funny
you will suffer Islam I'm going to come
back to you there is a third panelist as
well there is a third panelist as well
there is a third panelist as well so for
Islam Jonathan sorry you're hearing from
both the panelists you know the fact is
also this that ever since yogi
Adityanath came there is also a fear of
law yes there is a rise of fringe' as we
are seeing but there is also fear of law
that has been generated as well so the
action that has been taken within 24
hours if one may say it is under media
pressure because of this video clip
having gone viral but there is fear of
law would you say that a state as vast
as other predation
there is that approach that is being
brought by yogi Adityanath look there is
fear of law only amongst a section of
people there is a section and a sizable
section unfortunately which has the run
of the place what was fringe has now
become mainstream unfortunately and I
say this with a degree of pain because I
I belong to that state and things have
general you need to law cannot be
applied episodically it has to be
applied in a uniform pattern the same
standards must apply to all citizens of
all photo predation unfortunately
that is not being happened but I must if
a little nap has at this late stage
woken up to the fact and taken action
well
it's good he's done that he's done is
he's done is duty but the reason that
such elements are running amok is
because they feel for rightly or wrongly
that they have a like-minded government
which will look the other way now the
onus is on mister other cannot to prove
them wrong
such elements wrong okay okay let me get
the final comments now and start with
Zephyr Islam
therefore Islam is the is is yogi
Adityanath guilty of looking the other
way while the goons are running amok we
are seeing the framed Raj let me use
that phrase again on rise in with the
Pradesh
not at all I disagree with you
completely Maria the fact that there is
the government who is totally anti and
the anti social is accountable actually
where is accountability accountability
for those who commit crime and those who
actually there is a lapse on the part of
the head state administration they are
also being taken to task so let me take
make it very clear this is a party
gentle party government and with our
possession we believe in governance we
believe if we are delivering a
governance model which protects and
safeguard the interests of a common
citizen of this country and that is what
something which has been demonstrated by
Aditya Nagi in today
yes incident will happen but you tackle
it how you take action against those
culprits or something which everyone has
to see we have seen it Raj during during
samajwadi party where these people were
being welcomed a rape is being welcomed
by the chief minister and made him
lecture him all the criminals were
actually enjoying the support you keep
you keep saying kickin rajim language
silly applica shot vote para or skip bad
Aniki by the barber of Netenyahu compare
curtain samajwadi party get tenure say
give what about Ricky cazza macca mess
up up knock on the Cuyuna I'm not
comparing that's what I'm saying
I'm not comparing here for the sake of
comparing I am saying this is being
compared by the people of utter Pradesh
they are something worse to you they
know that the change has actually
brought on their complaint given you
enough time the final word is always to
the woman on the panel and that goes to
Jai Singh please go ahead dressing the
state is being governed by person on
their serious charges of murder and they
are protecting rapists the victim's
father is being killed in jail there are
gang wars in jail
criminals are shooting there are illegal
encounters happening in you P and I live
in you P day every day and every second
so where are the people happy and you
had no alternatives - Islam 24 hours
there is a person who is witness to this
beating and dinner as HP is putting out
a video holding these two people to
ransom and telling them how great you
can compare yourself to anyone but I
definitely don't think there is any
carnal Caraga any rupee so there is no
carnival garage as per Samajwadi Party
certainly these videos are very
disturbing and yogi Adityanath has to
send a message to these fringe that they
cannot be fringe Raj in utter Pradesh
there has to be can encourage as he
promised when he was seeking would in
2017 like to thank my guests on that
note politics over there a foul deal is
continuing citing the Hindu report
Congress president Rahul Gandhi and
former Finance Minister P Chidambaram

parallel negotiations on the deal and

we're cancelling the Pakistani visas who
what's going to happen are we going to
lose the right to host events are we

back to the controversy at hand
yes although I was at the wedding I have
never ever taken my eye off the ball
right as enough of the metaphors let's
talk about the banning of the two
Pakistani shooters with that it looks
like the IOC and company are coming down
heavily on India yes it is a classic
case of action replay action replay you
say yes we cancel visas for the
Pakistani competitors so we took action
right and so the IOC that is the Indian
Olympic Committee suspended India from
hosting international championships
so they took action action to our action
yes so action replay that should we play
mean so what you're basically saying is
right now Indian sport is in a bit of
flux please don't say that

Indians bosses in a state of flux again
I am saying please don't say that say
what flux no need for bad language
it's lux flux not listen listen is it

teS8aJrMPdE,Who Will Win The Battle Of Alliances For The 28 Lok Sabha Seats Of Tamil Nadu? | Epicentre,Actor-politician Vijayakanth's Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) will contest from four seats as a part of the ...,2019-03-06T16:30:02Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/teS8aJrMPdE/hqdefault.jpg,"a AIADMK and DMK are the two parties
that decide the family large politics
with little or no role of the two
national parties that is the Congress
and the BJP however after the death of
karna Nadi and jayalalithaa there is a
visible power vacuum which is almost
consumed the state and the outcome has
been a battleground of alliances for the
39 looks of our seats with the BJP and
the Congress joining the fray
the BJP has sealed the deal with a
AIADMK and the Congress has sealed the
deal with the DM came forming two large
blocks which continue to gather allies
the BJP is eyeing south to boost its
numbers at the center after the setback
and hindi belt in December 2018
elections and let's not forget that the
party believes that they have already
peaked in the hindi belt that is
interpretation and bihar and the DMK is
one of the very few allies with which
the Congress has managed to form a
tangible anti-bjp front so who has the
winning combination in Tamil Nadu as for
the 2014 performances there is clearly
with the BJP any AIADMK their alliance
going up to 60% of the wardship but
let's not forget gel Lalita who then was
at the helm of affairs meanwhile the
Congress DMK is at half of that at 30%
let me bring in the guests this evening
on election epicenter and go straight to
the journalists on the panel Narayan
Lakshmi helped me understand who has the
edge you know we cannot do direct
calculation in terms of arithmetic
anymore the absence of Jayalalitha and
absence of karna nadi is essentially
forcing these two players DMK a and a
AIADMK to force these alliances
absolutely maria you hit the nail on the
head and basically what you said is that
the absolute numbers do suggest that the
results could be leaning in favor of the
AAT MK BJP combined but like you said
again in the absence of julika there are
big question marks regarding how the
party car
and the party leadership will carry
themselves through the campaign and
deliver success if at all that's
possible because Jayalalitha held the
reins of the party very close to herself
she did not really allow second and
third level leadership to flourish so
what you see now with the chief mathusa
EPS and Deputy Chief Minister Oh PS they
are really not of the same caliber of
leaders that Jayalalitha was and there's
a real question mark over whether they
can galvanize the entire a AIADMK coddle
across the state in every district is
different in just the way thumbin our
society and politics is in order to you
know get the kind of votes the general
did in 2014 so to me the absolute
numbers do not translate from this one
absolutely it doesn't translate and for
the moment though a AIADMK is very
confused you know we do not understand
which is the really AIADMK who within
the a AIADMK actually has the support of
the masses and that is the reason why I
am saying that BJP doesn't really have
an advantage here they may have got into
a rainbow coalition you know and and
send a message that yes we have new
allies down south in Tamil Nadu but a
AIADMK is divided there's an EPS faction
there's a no PS faction there is a TT
within our current faction clean Sinha
which a AIADMK has the BJP aligned with
and when you say a rainbow coalition who
all are part of the rainbow coalition
because still there's no clarity on
vijayakanth anymore well you know after
the death of a senior leader like
Jayalalitha every party goes through a
certain transition phase but I think a
AIADMK has recovered fairly well for us
there is only one a AIADMK then which is
headed by the CN of the state and I'm
still pretty confident that with the
Alliance which we have put in place two
weeks ago we will manage to get a 50%
share what share what about with the
account you see part of the lines or is
he not part of the lines well for us you
know
DMDK you mean right yes
which icons DMDK yes well the CM has put
the conversation he had with the CM he
he was a part of the deal but as per
reports emanating today I he what he
still wants to negotiate a couple of
things but I would like to believe that
he is a part of the Alliance minor
negotiations you know can go on but I
think largely the deal is done okay
which is which is something the see when
you serve them has a specified okay on
the other side the DMK led Alliance I
would say here in the state of the mill
not it's a 2020 split clearly with the
20 seats being contested by DMK and 10
by the Congress and then others as well
Aishwarya Mahadev what is giving the
Congress this confidence and of course
let's not forget MK Stalin was the only
regional player to have clearly
categorically and openly who has said
openly that Rahul Gandhi should be the
next prime minister
I believe Mario very simply a lot of
infirmities that existed with the DMK
the last time around to not exist now
rather they seem to have transferred to
the a AIADMK let me make a few
clarifications in terms of organization
last time you had jelly that at the helm
and now what happened after that is you
see that the a AIADMK is a house divided
you have several factions DMK at 2014
which had come off the entire black mark
of the 2g scam which has now been
cleared you see that you had factions in
the entire family itself all of that has
been cleared and Stalin has been able to
manage and maintain the house and even
discussions with coalition allies has
gone on smoothly
the a AIADMK on the other hand is saying
today that we have an a coalition but
they don't and the biggest problem with
the AIADMK is also organization but the
second thing let me tell you Maria that
Tamil Nadu and southern states are very
aware as voters so the e AIADMK and the
BJP combine is a lose-lose situation
Aishwarya Aishwarya
as someone from Bihar I take objections
to that and I will and I have my
reservations when you say that people
from South are more aware and and they
decide I think you PPR voters are very
involved in the arguments no Mariano
what I know Maria what I'm going to say
yes terms with the center yeah go ahead
Maria what I'm trying to say is in terms
of how the center affects the southern
states for example the central the
central government's treatment of
southern states we've always seen a lot
of opposition in Tamil Nadu has been the
epicentre whether it's farmer protests
protests against stir led protests
against Modi as well so what I'm trying
to say is that we're far more aware of
how the center treats us as opposed to
just our regional governments and what
we have at that point so I think in that
sentiment the state at the state level
the a AIADMK and at the center the BJP
haven't done much for the people of
Tamil Nadu and the DMK stands to gain
because we have a good 10 seats for the
beer for the Congress 10 for the allies
and 20 for them and we're very confident
to winning okay we're a united house we
have a united plank in a platform
against the you know you know three in
Sanaa Aishwarya has a point here when
she says that the power transition that
has happened happened during the
lifetime of carnality during his
lifetime he made it clear that MK Stalin
is a successor as far as jail Aleta's
transition is concerned nobody knows who
did she actually choose as a successor
enough there were enough indications you
know during a lifetime that it was open
in cell 1 because every time she could
not continue as the Chief Minister she
chose her should she chose him as as as
someone who would be the de facto chief
minister that that did not happen during
her lifetime that that's the reason why
the power transition when we look at it
but Ithorian said I wanted to make a
point go ahead I'm trying to understand
is the BJP you know there are two yes
sir yes go ahead
yes so corona Liddy yes he had a
succession plan but there are two things
broadly if you look at it there are two
things which bind the
the DMK together one is dynastic
politics in two is the corruption which
emanates out of it for us the alliance
with the a AIADMK is a more natural
alliance it stems out of our admiration
from the best CM Silesia which India has
produced MGR you cannot but you're you
know and look at the desperation of the
DMK by striking an alliance with eight
different parties by a coalition which
you are really celebratory about no this
is ridiculous this is a ridiculous
comment what you know different states
demand different resounding yes not
anthropophaga head sorry
yes not a yes yes yes yes but what do
incident just said now is absolutely
ludicrous because firstly the a IBM k
zone chief and God a virtual political
god Emma would have been convicted along
with the sakala in a disproportionate
assets case had she not passed away so
don't please don't just associate
corruption with the DMK I'm not saying
that they are not corrupt they have also
had the cases but to say that the BJP
and AIADMK are natural combined because
they are not part of any corruption
scans or anything like that is the most
ludicrous thing as a said EE because as
we speak today there are scam questions
are echoing all across the country so
neither the BJP navi a DM k on the clear
and the previous point i wanted to make
was regarding what i shown in a said
which is i don't think she meant so much
that the voters of terminada are
uniquely aware but it's so much also
that they are thoughtful in a certain
way that they reflect the historical
understanding of this state which was
built on the politics of the Dravidian
movement as we know and suddenly that
movement has changed form and today to
reflect something else it is a much more
inclusive movement it includes all tamil
people and what is the best interest of
the caliber son yes but there's still
something very distinct about it which
does not sit comfortably with the
politics of the BJP with the says in the
class after in politics is still
slightly uncomfortable
position visa we what the Tamil people
want but there is no sense of a natural
alliance here but mr. Luckman would you
agree that things have changed the
reason why I am saying so is that
earlier BJP was a pariah there was no
question it he was they were almost
untouchable in terms of alliances you
cannot touch a BJP they would not want
to but now these the language of
politics in Tamil Nadu is also changing
you are you have say a Rajinikanth in
the politics you have camel hustle enter
politics and hence there are new
dynamics that are emerging that there's
new language that is emerging and hence
and a AIADMK is not a worse to aligning
with the BJP they understand that they
have anti-incumbency the BJP had Center
also has anti-incumbency still they are
open to an idea that is also a
reflection of the changing politics in
the state but let me ask you one
question Maria what election has been
held in Tamil our late most recently and
which could reflect what the people at
the Malad want Oscar J Jayalalithaa
passed away in the 2016 Assembly
election was the last one which she
bought one resoundingly and that is the
ammas factor I don't deny that after
that the only other election was the
by-election l where AIADMK breakaway
party AMM KTTV Dina current one
resoundingly and yes that was also
allegedly due to massive amounts of
money changing hands so it is very
difficult to assume from on that basis
that the idiom of politics itself has
changed and they are now very open to
welcoming the BJP with open arms I'm
sorry that's not the case at all equally
I could argue that the people of Tamil
Nadu as elsewhere in India are very
badly hit by GST and B monetization and
advice a lot of the trade then why would
a DM k agreed to ally with the BJP that
is the billion dollar question Maria
because they are bankrupt politically
and maybe even financially losing money
and the BJP has the money muscle to bail
them out okay to infini it's not a
natural alliance
it's about bankers ludicrous as it can
get okay that's an absolutely ludicrous
charge the factors that Modi G's
acceptance beyond the Hindi Heartland
and today I can tell
with a fair sense of responsibility
there out of the five seats we are
contesting we will win three seats okay
you know of all the local issues which
get to get involved in in local
elections let me tell you that national
elections in in the national elections
voters have a different voting pattern
that they have different preferences and
a lot of these issues and you all know
that to a I'd a DMK has gone through a
tough phase it has gone through a period
of transition so yes it sees a BJP as a
as a natural Alliance at the national
level okay okay I should I do you know I
think it's extremely unfortunate that
this is the sort of shallow
understanding that you have you know for
coming from the BJP let me remind
everybody that amma basically portrayed
herself as this juggernaut that was
going to stand as a Dravida movement she
was going to stand against what the
north was doing in which is also
something that very strongly resonated
the e AIADMK i have to reiterate as a
house divided they stand to gain from
the BJP now and the BJP has nothing to
lose right which is why they're probably
looking towards this the DMK and the
Indian National Congress have
traditionally been allies and they've
also had you know we've been through in
2014 it was a very rough patch you had
indictments which have been cleared you
had a lot of that but that way the
Congress is also the sort of party that
has given them a lot of leeway in
regional politics and that is why we
have a stronger ally and Stalin himself
has made far greater a change because
the power transition has been smooth you
haven't seen the sort of usurping and
you know the three four factions coming
up and in the South that does make a
huge impact Mario and I believe that the
BJP will not attain anything and just to
say you know paint it and generalize and
say more than I believe is going to come
in is fallacious to say the least
you know Aishwarya I also find that
argument flawed because if the Congress
has failed to have alliance in yupi or
in Delhi or even in Andhra Pradesh in
Bengal it's also because the regional
players in these states have prime
ministerial ambitions narayan lakshmi
wayne on this this is clear that MK
stalin by saying that he thinks rao
Gandhi is best suited for the prime
minister he has opted out of that race
so he is very comfortable dealing with
the Congress while Congress is trying to
look for allies in other states in Tamil
Nadu it has a comfortable equation with
a regional player and hence that the
lions could also take place we're going
to iron out a deal soon nobody whether
that's also but that's also because
these regional players do not have prime
ministerial ambitions with law in jail
ministerial race so it's a different
story in these states
Amal I'm seeing a dove era a myopathy is
all of them are in prime ministerial
race when it comes to opposition any of
them if they have the numbers can emerge
as the face yes Norah Laxman coming here
yeah I think the interesting point that
you are getting to Manya is that when
the Congress is picking certain allies
and like you correctly said they are
allies in some cases like Stalin who do
not have the prime ministerial ambition
but you have to look at what is the
weakness within those alliances and why
are those parties chosen to go with the
Congress and like I think our discussion
earlier correctly pointed out the DMK
had a very neat leadership succession
plan in place and it it was actually
executed as planned
however just given the fact that like
general Jayalalitha but in a slightly
different vein Caruana he was a very
domineering powerful leader based on a
long history with the Dravidian movement
he too did not Stalin
according to many analysts is not
anywhere nearly as powerful as his
father in terms of managing the Carter
of his of the DMK and delivering any
when Victory's he's not really done that
and if anything his father was already
ailing by the 2016 Assembly election
here and he was though he might have
been the working president he was
running Madras and you could argue that
he failed there to deliver and similarly
questions about how strong the DMK under
him will be in the southern districts of
thommanon so there are some question
marks there however in the situation
between the DMK and the Congress even if
you has weaknesses it is nowhere
comparable it cannot be compared to the
absolute inconsistencies and fallacies
that exist within the ad MK BJP combined
more two more antithetical parties could
not have come together and now calling
themselves grandly as a rainbow
coalition as if they were going to float
right into the sky coalition will float
into the sky so in cinah
but in one moment I'm saying but but you
have to give it to the BJP that they
have forged your line and alliance it
was almost seen as unthinkable and
almost impossible here is a regional
player who are lines with the BJP and
they have managed a rainbow coalition so
while on the other side there is a
mahogany Bund on we are supposedly as
you know we are supposed to believe
optically they are Muhammad bun then but
they are still looking at allies here is
the BJP going from one state to another
insuring that the lies are in place as
from before much before the election
dates are to be announced twins in are
coming yes absolutely because there are
certain states where we have been very
realistic about our performance as we we
know we are not strong and in that in
those states our strategic alliance and
an early alliance work for us so far as
the Congress is concerned let me tell
you that you know in the same way that
Akhilesh Yadav and the Chandrababu Naidu
you ask them they would know what
happens when you alive with the Congress
and Stalin is going to learn it the hard
way
gotcha okay okay Aishwarya
first thing Mario and what you said
previously I it has been made very clear
that nobody is going to talk about the
prime ministerial candidates there are
lot of coalition's you know an alliance
is being cobbled up in a lot of states
and none of the talk about prime
ministers even in my home state of
Karnataka mr. David Gordon and his son
have also expressed that you know if
Karnataka wins all if the coalition wins
all you could potentially see a
Connecticut right up there you know in
the high echelons of power that is
immaterial but the second fact is the
BJP is going and making these convenient
alliances because there are zero and
they can only go up if at all and that
is what you have to acknowledge you
realize that they have no presence you
realize that in the southern states and
especially it's extremely hilarious that
in a state like Tamil Nadu that is
precipice on that auntie you know
imposition the idea of imposition of
language and the entire Dravida
sentiment you see that the BJP coming in
there and bending over backwards to
allow the a AIADMK or you know to
basically take what they want out of
this this is a coalition of convenience
because the BJP has nothing to lose even
the MDMK now is reluctant for the fact
that Vijay Khan's photos were even taken
out to the Prime Minister's rally
because they all see that they can sit
in bargain as much as they want DMK was
giving vijay can't
sorry DMDK we were giving vijayakanth
only four seats he said four with a
AIADMK and pushed to seven or eight so
they're basically holding the AIADMK and
BJP ransom while our coalition has
basically safely been put to the side
and they're working already in the
panchayat level okay the a AIADMK and
the BJP are going to struggle the fact
that jail Alita is not there is a huge
loss because she was an electioneering
juggernaut and it's extremely
unfortunate but none of this are going
to help them over you know you also
believe you also believe that the same K
Stalin has not succeeded or has failed
to fill in his father's shoes to means
enough so you know I heard my Congress
friends saying we banished to strike
alliances even when there is no
rationale or logic that only explains
that only manifests the kind of you know
faith our regional partners our partners
have it or having us now contrast it
with what is happening in the third
provision ecclesia that says of course
Congress
the part of the Alliance we've given
them two seats this is how they insult
the Congress have you nobody and compare
it with what has happened in Tamilnadu
even there we the Congress admits that
we don't have a strong presence even
there we get a five five seats even
there we manage to strike in alliance
much ahead of the DMK alliance where our
document does this argument really hold
which is being given by the BJP
spokesperson no I don't think I any of
these arguments hold because what you
are looking at is the battle of money
muscle that the BJP has very very deep
pockets the money muscle of the BJP
combined with the leadership vacuum of
the alien cane they hope will fuse
together and somehow produce a vast
number of votes in their favor I'm not
saying I'm not saying the DMK is going
to be massively successful or
overwhelming result but they don't have
this level of weakness as I said their
weakness is only the untested nature of
Stalin's leadership let's not forget I
want to remind any everyone outside of
Tamil Nadu that there is such a thing in
the Tamil vote or thermal electric
electorate that they have a distinct
view on what is good for this state and
what is good for the Tamil people and it
does not necessarily at all tie in with
the BJP is nationalistic view in the two
of you Safran okay the final words to
the woman on the panel aishwarya maha
they have 10 seconds to you Thank You
Maria I believe that this is a step in
the right direction for the Indian
National Congress
I am very certain that you will see
results here and as you know my learning
panelists also have spoken about that
you know there is a very different wave
in a lot of states and every state is a
different formula and I think that the
Indian National Congress is going about
it the right way and not just gobbling
up alliances alright thank you so much
three in Scenario Mahadev Narayan
Lakshman thank you so much we are
sleeping the short break coming up next
water words over a fall continues after
governments stolen files twist in the
Supreme Court
and in a three hour long hearing the
Supreme Court the bench came down
heavily on the government for citing
national security as a reason to resist
the probe into the acquisition of the
Rafal jets during the hearing the center
represented by Tony General KK Venugopal
in fact dropped a bombshell and alleged
that documents related to Rafal were
stolen from the defense ministry
hence the English daily that Hindu
published confidential papers that were
never supposed to be in public domain
and compromised the national security
the matter has been adjourned for
hearing now to March 14th when the
center has to show the epics court
action that has been taken regarding the
stolen files
the falsehood and dishonesty is also
corruption is now writ large based on
the report of the Indian negotiation
team and as per the report of the Indian
negotiation team the price of the 36
aircraft is eight thousand four hundred
sixty million euros or sixty three
thousand four hundred and fifty K Road
and not what is claimed by Prime
Minister Modi and his government which
is seven eight nine zero million euro or
fifty nine thousand corrode

the National Party could have emerged as
the fulcrum of the mahathat Bandhan or
an anti Modi block so far the Congress
chief Rahul Gandhi's philosophy of a
colossal array is the one defining its
electoral calculation but for all the
optics the envisioned moody versus a
united opposition is not shaping up as
the rld samajwadi party
Bojan somach party single the deal in
Uttar Pradesh Akhilesh Yadav has made it
clear there will be no rethink on the
seat sharing relegating the Congress to
its bastions of Amity and ribéry leap
Muhammad of energy will go alone in West
Bengal while Congress is now eyeing an
alliance with the left in Bengal
Chandrababu Naidu has made it clear that
he will go solo in Andhra Pradesh after
the project could mean disaster in
Telangana last year while in New Delhi
the aam aadmi party the Congress
alliance is almost off the table here
are some of the inside details that we
are getting now top congress sources
in fact top congress sources have told
CNN news 18 very clearly that it was the
majority view - not a lie with the aam
aadmi party former Delhi Congress chief
AJ makan and PC choco spoke in favor of
the Lions with maken going to the extent
of saying he won't contest
if there is no alliance with aam aadmi
party majority of leaders were wary as
aam aadmi party attacked Sheila Dikshit
and against unity at the center and a
political fight in Delhi RAL Gandhi
eventually bagged the majority view Poli
Poli be gauche is getting us that inside
story Pallavi is a window of
negotiations still open ahmadi party has
announced candidates for six of seven
seats of Delhi of course that's part of
the pressure building tactics looks very
very tough but it's not over yet and
that's exactly what my top Congress
sources at the centre are telling me
very quickly really Marya inside that
meeting which took place there were a
hot exchange or worse now ironically a
Jay McCann who's always been against an
alliance with amp actually spoke about
in its defence today saying that
circumstances have changed he will make
an oblique reference to the post
airstrikes kind of a sentiment which is
clearly in favor of the BJP and the
Prime Minister so he pointed out that
much as I would hate to have an alliance
with up I realized that it's important
otherwise we are not going to win any
one seat all together Sheila Dikshit
made it very clear that a situation has
improved on the ground so it will be
suicidal because ARP has always been an
enemy number one and they actually had
joined hands with the BJP in 2014 and
ensured a disastrous defeat for us but
that's where the matters ended because
Rahul Gandhi said I am going to have my
own opinion but that's aside at the end
of the day I am going to go by what is
the majority the key word is it was all
the consensus when it was a majority and
therefore Sheila Dikshit comes out to
say that it's final I'm not going to
have an alliance with up but the matter
is likely to shift at the central
leadership there are some top Congress
leaders who have been in favor of an
alliance with up I'm going to actually
get down to a real assessment of the
situation they're going to realize how
bad it is really
on the ground and therefore the pressure
may also come in from the other
opposition political parties in a
Congress party to do everything so I
wouldn't close all the doors it seems
very very tough at this point of time
but it's my happy little window of
opportunity is still open for our
Congress Alliance pallavi you know
talking about various states Andhra
Pradesh Uttar Pradesh Bengal now Delhi
if the window of any kind of an alliance
with these regional players are closing
then what exactly is the Congress trying
to send a message can they really be
that face of opposition and is this
really a united opposition taking on a
render Modi well it's not looking good
for the Congress party at all and in
fact many when the opposition of anybody
upset with the Congress party saying
that when will they get down from the
high horse why don't they realize that
is a writing on the wall we all need to
sink in our differences and really come
together the pictures the same in
orthopod age in Appalachia of course
they've realized that you cannot have an
alliance with the TDP and still be in
the reckoning against the BJP or other
political parties over there it doesn't
look very good for the Congress party
but I think that's where the pressure
really will come in from the other
opposition political parties the point
is will the Congress party understand
that I took on the wall will the
Congress party even listen to its
opposition partners or allies or
potential allies I think that call is
still yet to be taken
all right Pallavi goes thank you so much
for getting us that inside story is the
window of negotiations still open
Pallavi says yes but also adds that the
Congress for all its alliances it's not
looking good now let me bring in the
guests now Raji found a BJP leader here
in the studio Javed Ansari senior
journalist NASA ruse and Congress member
of parliament and action Marathi is
Armani party spokesperson he'll be
joining me shortly let me bring in Nasir
Hussain now Sarah sent tell me 2019 who
is the Congress fighting against
natsu-san if you can hear me now see I
think it's very clear that the Congress
party has tried to stage alliances or
two all across the countries trying able
we were able to be successful in
building up alliances in many of these
states in some states we do have
problems the road and the role is not
yet over
I think there's still time to build up a
Lancer save a few states where I think
we have some confusion some problems but
there are otherwise in most of your
states I think the ally Alliance is or
do you tell me where west bring all
there is no alliance we have a third
Pradesh India's biggest state there is
no alliance Samajwadi Party BSP and rld
have forged an alliance they have kept
you out of it
here in Delhi Arvind Kejriwal has gone
ahead and made announcements or four six
candidates out of seven so certainly you
have also given up on that alliance I'm
trying to understand is the Congress not
able to read the writing on the wall
when you say that this is and this is an
election to save democracy I am trying
to understand are you trying to save
yourself or save democracy or what are
you trying to project Maria we have
alliances in Bihar we have a lines in
John currently avalanche and modest ravi
avalanche in karnataka v our alliance in
tamil nadu talks are still on and then
it's clear it's clear it's clear it's
clear we are having a government there
we will have an alliance there I think
there are talks on for West Bengal we
have a lines in Jammu Kashmir that we
have talks on for West Bengal which
might have talks on for interpretation
on the package on the and of dish and
telogen also no alliance with who in
Jammu and Kashmir which party
we have aligned with national okay okay
okay let me bring in Akshay Marathi I'm
on the party spokesperson he's joining
me here in the studio HM errata you know
I am trying to understand what exactly
is the opposition's agenda for 2019
for all the talks that I have seen so
far of opposition parties coming
together and trying to build this
narrative that this is about saving
democracy if it is indeed about saving
democracy than it is about forging
alliances as well why no lines would the
Congress party I think this question
must be directed to the Congress party
today because after so long after it has
spent so long trying to decide whether
to go into an alliance or not finally it
has betrayed the people of Delhi who
actually wanted to see mr. moody out of
power because of the last four years the
elected government of Delhi has not been
allowed to function because of the party
in the centre now when in the interest
of the people of Delhi and in the
interest of the people of India all
opposition parties are saying let's put
one candidate against one BJP candidate
that's the only way to defeat the BJP
today but that's what happening in Delhi
it's not happening a new piece are
happening in mingle the question today
is why is the Congress party placing its
own party's interests above the
interests of the people in this country
that's exactly my question no solution
here is your potential ally or just
optical I saying to raising a question
respond see Maria I think when we have
alliances in most part of the country
when there are difficulties in having
alliance in a couple of states and still
there is time for negotiations and pass
still time for bargaining and stilton of
time for discussion I think these two
three states where the negotiations are
still on I think even those states in
next few days or few weeks I think
things will be in place but why don't we
why don't you people realize that we
have state alliances in most parts of
the country where we can if we wait we
have other parties to do P UTI 80cm
string one has more than 40 seat we have
one video it's a lot easier
and Roswell absolutely that's a Kandra
and also still talks are on we had an
experiment in telangana in the assembly
election basis on the alleged analysis
of the results of the results in
Telangana state I think the party both
the TDP and the Congress party are
pointing as to how to how do we adjust
in seats how do we accommodate the
Alliance's everything is on the one hand
you have amateur goings to state after
state forging new alliances for the me
GP the Congress is ditching alliances
for what why is there no urgency in the
Congress they are the biggest opposition
party right now I don't see the fight in
the Congress to defeat the BJP if they
are serious they should start talking to
other parties forge an alliance together
that's the only way to take on the BJP
and save this country from the devos
dictatorship that's what I'm saying that
that brings me to the next question that
I am going to ask Jonathan sorry
Jonathan sorry
all these opposition parties give
perfect optics you know all of them turn
up at each other's the Hartness
swearing-in ceremonies that have that
I've got started with LD k SD
Kumaraswamy but when it comes to real
electoral arithmetic why is that missing
is it because of individual ambitions
and then why how is BJP wrong in saying
that yeah Josiah Dinanath ahead on Ethan
or anything a well I'll tell you why
this is why this is proving to be a
difficult mara can you please ask
somebody to fix my I'm getting a echo in
my yes I'll just get it done my producer
is fixing that job it's up yes please go
ahead now yeah so this is precisely
because of the inability of different
political parties to say to put
put their status objective of putting up
a 1:1 2:1 fight against the opposition
above above party interests each one of
them wants to preserve that if each one
of them wants to increase their area of
influence and that's why they are
falling short of their stated objective
of a one-to-one fight the Congress is to
blame and and and all sides are to blame
the Congress is to blame in some
instances the regional parties are to
blame in other instances the regional
parties believe that the Congress are at
its weakest
so let's squeeze them the Congress
believes that if it can test only 200
seats then rather than how many will it
will and how will it increase their seat
chair so therefore you have these
conflicting claims and and this also
reflects very pouring out on the
leadership qualities of respective
political parties they're there their
inability to rein in their reasons that
is the reason why Raji funding here is
smiling even as Amida party is asking
questions to the Congress party because
their political opponents are they
themselves it's aam aadmi party and the
Congress that is fighting among
themselves while the BJP is sitting and
watching they are forming up their
alliances they are forming up the
candidates and also having the love
Maria it's not like that you know
Congress is sending a very clear signal
that Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi ji
photocopy of Indra G that they are not
serious about contesting election 2019
they know very well that these all
parties including aam aadmi party
Samajwadi Party BSP and all parties have
taken over their votes so they had taken
a call that let us not fight 2019
election we will fight to tell you about
that I'm telling you I am saying you see
the Bihar he has said that Bihar also in
Bihar three seats the pitch posaga Bihar
may be audio made a pass information I
am Garland's we are or make another a
sunny Here I am at my party who defeated
Congress and made nil is so fearful
about the Modi ji popularity
giving three seats second point is the
policy of this against Congress you only
sing last point but I'm saying Congress
is not visible at least in 250 seats now
you pee Bihar Bengal Andhra only captain
Congress party will fight election with
BJP Akali in Punjab in Delhi it will
fight between aam aadmi party and BJP
congress will try to get there so what
I'm saying
there is decided this is like it's an
you know the question is that if all of
you cannot come together pre-poll with
your stated objective of saving
democracy while the stated objective is
save ourselves because here is a bigger
force in Prime Minister Narendra Modi
your stated objective is something then
post poll if you come together then the
divisional it will be about SATA it will
be about power
so then why how is BJP wrong in assess
making an assessment of you guys as
having the only objective of power post
poll only because Agora pequea agenda
such men who talk which millibar attack
which ideas milk a to shine a alliances
be horoho thay Marya see i think i
should first tell the BJP spokesperson
and remind him and ask him various PDP
today whereis Jeetendra ma ji today
is for SWAT Kushwaha today where is TDP
today what happened with the troubled
relationship issue Sena what happened
with their blow hot blow cold
relationship with J do so let them not
teach us a lesson in in having a
coalition we have run coalition
government for 10 full years they can
respond and we have coalition
governments in states as well and then
you should also understand that any
political party will have different
strategies for different states the
politics at the state level is different
so that is what is today I agree I agree
that strategy is an internal party
matter I leave it to the Congress decide
what the strategy is but as of now on
the face it appears that the Congress is
trying to help the BJP whether in Delhi
whether in Bengal whether in route the
Pradesh Congress is giving mixed signals
to the people of these states they're
saying that on the one hand they are
opposing the BJP but when it comes to
elections when it comes to electoral
alliances they are saying we are going
to cut the votes of the anti-bjp
spectrum of voters how is this going to
help this country rid itself of the
Menace that the BJP has created I am
responding sir
mahadji was with me Bihar may win
capacity r % o % bow ties or south or a
percent vote later Kenneth E is the
Amero old partner while Rama recite
receipts sharing hitsuki a shiv sena
kali an AI d MK you should remember the
general Tegea statement that how he
supported on the civil code and ram can
you measure all three ideological
partners are solidly with me
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
seelix is the most honest person whom
arvind kejriwal
very big drama in delhi and finished
congress party now they are trying to
lick the boot of congress party to win
final word I'm just asking all the
political guests on this panel to tell
me their political opponent for 2019
because I am increasingly getting
confused as to against whom is the aam
aadmi party fighting this elections
against whom is the Congress pufta party
fighting this election as far as the BJP
is concerned they are fighting against
the entire opposition tell me Nasser
Hussain who is your opponent
[Music]
yeah Marya I think I think it is very
clear mundo Congress party is fighting
against who are the alliance partners in
different states body to three states
where the discussion is on we have
alliances as well strategy in certain
states in certain state don't don't ask
me the Davila strategy in certain stage
you will get to know and did you thank
you the results will be out by 2019 LX
mu P again give me a trial affianced the
people of the country are with us the
way they have ditched the people of this
country everything is very clear very
clear and the people of this country
know who is fighting against whom who
have rather were raised the issues of
the people in the past five years that
is the reason why they gave us rap
mandate in they will be in five states
continuously whether it was Punjab
whether it was Karnataka whether in the
last three stable in the heartland
country the duo who destroyed our
economy destroyed our federalism
destroyed our Constitution it's the BJP
which is the biggest enemy of this party
and I'm a devotee is writing and other
parties fighting the BJP the Congress in
Delhi and is is a third player it's a
small player it will cut into our votes
but will still fight the BJP and be
defeated okay finally watts to job is
Ansari when you see this chaos can you
repeat your question I'm saying there's
this chaos that we are seeing while on
the other side alliances are forming up
seed sharing is being decided candidates
being decided well obviously as things
stand the advantage is clearly with the
bjp-led combine the opposition has
fallen far short of what its strategy
it's as in worst which is and massage
which is a one to one against the BJP in
at least 480 plus seats at the moment
that looks highly unlikely and therefore
it's BJP and the NDA are the combined to
beat the advantage lies with them and
not with the opposition all right thank
you so much Jonathan sorry rajid funny
Jonathan sorry Anna Saracen and Akshay
Mirada thank you so much for joining us
so clearly the battle for 2019 as the
narrative still shapes up is also about
strong regional players asserting
themselves not giving space to the
Congress party as well for aerial
strikes is continuing the Prime Minister
has in fact hit out at the opposition
for politicizing airstrikes on terror
camps in Pakistan accusing them of
towing Pakistan's line this after
several opposition leaders questioned
why the Modi government was not
revealing the exact figure of the fatal
tease a day after IAF chief Donna said
he cannot give an exact figure while
Amit Shah BJP president has said that
250 terrorists were killed

Ym1YiC0q0YU,Pakistan Govt Issues Order To Seize Assets Of All Banned Outfits Under UN Sanctions Regime | Faceoff,The federal government on Monday issued an order to streamline the process for implementation of sanctions against individuals ...,2019-03-04T16:15:01Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ym1YiC0q0YU/hqdefault.jpg,"good evening we're starting off with
some breaking news here right at the top
of face off Pakistan has reissued orders
to freeze the assets against designated
terror groups or individuals who may
have been prescribed by the United
Nations Security Council this particular
order has been reissued just moments ago
it asks all departments all ministries
concerned to implement the United
Nations Security Council 1373 resolution
which came out in 2001 this was
immediately after 9/11 this order has
now been reissued as there is massive
pressure on Pakistan from the United
Nations Security Council in the wake of
what happened in pol Varma the terror
attack in which 40 CRPF neurons were
killed some of these groups which have
been prescribed by the United Nations
Security Council includes the
lashkar-e-taiba which was prescribed
right after the 2008 Mumbai terror
attacks in fact the head of the lodge
creativa Hafiz Muhammad side is also a
globally prescribed terrorist as per the
UNSC sanctions committee let me go
across Tamar Siddiqui who tracks the
External Affairs Ministry for us this is
an order that was issued by the UNSC in
2001 what is the purpose of Pakistan
reissuing this now in 2019 and what may
this mean in practical terms what how
does it affect are those groups or
individuals who may have been prescribed
by the UNSC so this UNSC 13.73 a
resolution actually gives out the best
practices which should be implemented
against terror outfits and clamping down
on terror outfits and so it has the many
points by means of which terror outfit
can be brought under control out of
which some are about taking action on
the ground
eliminating terror safe havens about
choking their financing that is one of
the major elements of the UNSC one-sheet
seventies resolution now welcome to some
of my sources and they believed that
this reshoring of this order these
guidelines is just another way of
Pakistan to show that they are acting
but these are guidelines which Pakistan
has always been in the north they should
have always been acting on it but this
so the question is that by now putting
this on their national counter-terrorism
authority website under public
announcement what are they trying to
indicate are they saying that they will
go all out and act against Jesse
Mohammed and its leadership now that is
a question that Pakistani authorities
will have to act on the ground to show
results at the moment it is just words
that are emanating from the Pakistani
side and clearly they are doing so
because they are under intense pressure
there is no specific circular that talks
about cracking down on Jesse Mohammed
issuing these guidelines in that context
this is a generic guideline that has
been issued to all ministries and
departments saying that this is how you
should go about cracking down on terror
outfit alright ma Suzuki we leave it at
that the Pakistani authorities reissuing
in order are just moments ago talking
about the seizure and the freezing of
assets of proscribed organizations and
individuals as per the UNSC
1373 a resolution

pdFSxlFldjg,Will Imran Khan Walk The Talk Of His Naya Pakistan ? | Faceoff With Zakka Jacob,BreakingNews #IndiaStrikeBack #HindiNews #IndiaNews #LiveHindiNews #Pakistan #Pulwama #Airstrike #IndianAirForce ...,2019-02-27T16:45:00Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pdFSxlFldjg/hqdefault.jpg,"good evening it's been 13 days since the
Palama terror attack in which 40 CRPF
neurons were killed while pakistani hand
in that terror attack was exposed right
from the start today the Prime Minister
of Pakistan
Imran Khan for the second time in the
last two weeks has asked for proof asked
for evidence of Pakistani involvement in
pivara today India handed over a dossier
to Pakistan with irrefutable proof of a
Pakistani hand in what is the worst
terror attack that India has witnessed
in a decade
here's what that dossier contains number
one this dossier was handed over to the
deputy High Commissioner of Pakistan he
was summoned to the MEA headquarters in
South Block this dossier was handed over
with specific details of the je Muhammad
and its complicity in the pull wama
attack that happened on the 14th of
February number two there were details
of the presence of J M terror camps
specifically this Bala court gam how
many personnel at housed how many
Fedayeen how many trainers which blocks
it had and also the specific leadership
of the GAO Mohammed in Pakistan three
the details of the jihad training course
at the Bala code camp who was running it
who was the leadership there who are the
trainers and what kind of course was
being taught to the jihadis the fresh
batch of jihadis who had come there the
course which was which began on the 20th
of February all of those details have
been shared in that dossier it also has
the number of trainers and the number of
terrorists who were spread between two
blocks block a and Block B they total
are in excess of 300 people who were
there in that Bala Court camp which
forced India to attack that particular
camp in an airstrike crossing the LC 323
terrorists in all were present in Bala
court which is the largest terror
training camp which the Jessie Mohammed
runs in Pakistan India has now
explicitly said the MEA in fact put out
a press release saying that they expect
Pakistan to take immediate and
verifiable action
against terrorism the fact is there is a
sense of deja vu about this dossier
we have given dossiers in the past as
well to Pakistan in the aftermath of
26/11 in the aftermath of the Parliament
attack in the aftermath of Putin code
nothing has come of it why should we
believe anything will be different this
time around will Imran Khan walked the
talk about his new his Naya Pakistan as
he calls it alright let's try and put
those questions to a panel who are
joining us tonight and this on a day
when an Indian Air Force pilot is in
Pakistani custody after the mig-21 that
he was flying was shot down by Pakistani
army he has been identified and we can
now say that he's been identified as
wing commander up here on the bottom on
he was flying a mig-21 bison I'll get to
wing commander
I mean undone in in just one second but
let me start with the dossier story here
in our studios i'm joined by Prabhu
Dayal former diplomat
Major General retired Rajesh chharia
defense expert Abbott Malby a
spokesperson of the BJP mr should PS
Aravalli achieve of the western and
southern commands and Praveen Swamy his
group consulting editor with Network 18
I'll start with you Praveen do you
expect anything different in the dossier
that's been given today because twice in
the last two weeks twice since Paloma
has happened all right we'll try and go
across the province ami if we can
establish contact but let me start with
you probably all twice Imran Khan has
said give me evidence
I will act including today he has said
the same thing he said India can't be
judge jury and executioner
we've given evidence in the form of this
dossier do you expect the result to be
any different than what we've seen in
the past no I don't expect for the
simple reason that Pakistan has paid
scant regard to the evidence that we
have provided to it in all earlier cases
so why then do we have to go through
this well in this particular instance
there is a smoking gun because the
Jessie Muhammad claimed responsibility
for the pulvinar terror attack now when
there is an organization which is based
in Pakistan
by a Pakistani which is claiming
responsibility then what more proof is
needed however you have to go through
the norms you have to give as much
evidence to Pakistan as possible because
otherwise they have the argument laid
out that you have not given any evidence
so what can we do
going by past records the Pakistanis are
not likely to take any action in regard
to any of the evidence which is provided
to them okay
there are masters of denial yeah they
are always in a denial mode so I think
that this matter also will not make any
headway regional area if the result of
this exercise is going to be the same as
the result of what happened after Pathan
code or what happened after 26/11 then
why are we going through the charade
good-evening Sokka Sokka I am one of
those who does not advocate war India
has taken a very bold step yesterday by
upscaling the war on terrorism which is
being perpetrated from Pakistan it
always had we always had this option but
we excise the restraint so that the some
sense will prevail in Pakistan because
this is a new norms but India has laid
out to the world that how a terrorism
can be dealt with there will always be
further escalation which leads to more
destruction and more collateral damage
be India being in non warmongering
country we don't want to advocate to the
world that look Wireless can be treated
with a violence only we don't want to
advocate right giving give given our
history and a background or the way we
are but the PUC as a as the Westerner
said the Pakistan is not the country
which has to be believed but Imran Khan
has been him I don't want to use those
derogatory words has been asking again
and again and again give me proof I will
act here's the proof we have to
strengthen and grants hands to against
the hope against the hope right he may
be able to act we are not banking on
that hope okay we are ready
to go a Marshall PS Oliver Lea's on the
bond the broadcast so is omit Malviya
spokesperson of the BJP am I shall start
with this very very unfortunate incident
where a Wing Commander a fighter pilot
who was flying a mig-21 bison were his
his his flight was shot down by the
Pakistanis he's now in Pakistani custody
there are pictures of him doing the
rounds on social media the DG is PR in
Pakistan has put out some videos of Wing
Commander urban and then as well ah what
I want to ask you is this how made this
change the dynamic that we have seen in
the last 24 hours or so well Xhaka
basically the Pakistani response to the
Mirage 2000 strike yesterday morning was
carrying out this kind of an activity
along the LOC and what was this activity
for this activity of these f-16s were
actually just showing showing themselves
because the time that they were coming
and the height altitude that they were
flying it was very obvious that they
would be picked up so they were making
sure that they are picked up and this
was to play to their home gallery to the
domestic gallery that they are
responding to what happened yesterday
morning okay Ababa having said that it
went a little ory we had the shoes which
were available there we had these
mig-21s which should not perhaps have
taken on the the the f-16s in the manner
in which they did but whatever it was it
went Ori it actually did not achieve
from the Pakistani side alone what they
wanted to do okay also drop some
ordnance you know in an open field just
to indicate that yeah they did something
why would I be left I'll explain to our
viewers why why would somebody send a
heavy duty high cost asset like an f-16
just to drop ordnance in an open field
why would they do that this that's what
I'm saying that this is a bluff this is
a perception game played by the
Pakistani authorities
to send these aircraft to indicate to
their home audience mainly and also to
our audience that look they are prepared
and they will take some action and
that's what they did it was more
symbolic than anything else however it
went wrong it went wrong because in f-16
but shut up next twenty one got shut up
and now the situation is ideal for the
escalation ladder to climb so what do we
do next
everyone asking the same question now
what should India do no doubt about it
that India has to indicate the resolve
India has to indicate that look this
kind of an incident is not going to stop
us from carrying on with a war on terror
but the question is what do you do next
yes are you going to carry out more
strikes are you going to go and hit
terrorist targets or you go to give
other hit other targets the question now
is and the bigger question how far do
you want to go have you done a risk
analysis which you must have done surely
that do you want to get into a
conventional war and a conventional war
is not advocated certainly not from our
side and absolutely not from the
Pakistani side so if you have played
blackjack soccer it's double of which
you know and you've got to play the game
because this is going to be a
psychological game and it's going to be
hard military game also okay whoever
drinks first
okay whoever goes first I think the one
were one very very critical factor we
need to take into account of course is
the fact that one of our men is in
Pakistani custody it's been formally
acknowledged today by the MEA
spokesperson ah his his his his pictures
are doing the rounds of social media ah
Amit Malviya two things stood out in the
India me a briefing today one is the
acceptance that yes and Indian Air Force
pilot is missing in action subsequently
they have they have also said in in the
dossier that was submitted in the
damashii that was issued to the
Pakistani deputy High Commissioner that
the vulgar display of an injured in an
Air Force pilot is unacceptable to India
it's a violation of the Geneva
Convention my question to you is
it's taking off from what a Marshall PS
ahluwalia said can we afford not to
escalate this because the Pakistanis and
this was mentioned again in the mea
printers spokespersons press conference
the Pakistani intention was to hit one
of our military installations well you
know Sokka I think the permission that
came in today or at least tried to come
in did not really seem to have an
intention to strike at any military
establishment because had they done this
this would have been an open declaration
of war because let's not forget that the
Indian strike was a non military
preemptive strike it was targeted at
jesh training camps and josh has in the
past taken responsibility for several
attacks that have happened on Indian
soil including the most recent one on
Pulwama so there's a huge difference
between what the Indian government did
and what the Pakistanis were perhaps
intending to do or to signal back home
now having said that the fact of the
matter is today that Pakistan stands
isolated
despite the bravado that it is putting
forth it has the international opinion
quite contrary to its position and of
course India has changed its position as
far as war on terror is concerned
India has in a way taken lead now it has
first diplomatically isolated Pakistan
and now is taking military offensive as
and when it is required let's not forget
we are the biggest victims of terror
that has been unleashed from Pakistani
soil it was only much later that
countries like the United States or
United Kingdom really realized the
Menace of terrorism when it started to
hit their you know assets and their
citizens as well now having said that
what happens from here is something that
is best left to the Government of India
and there's no point speculating on it
but what I do think that when the
government of India decided to undertake
strike I'm sure the men in f4 sand in
army and in the Navy have all factored
in various scenarios and escalation such
as these I'm sure they have mechanisms
and they have timelines and they have
modalities and how they are going to
respond okay going to be patient because
some of those things can't be false we
are not even preview of what's likely to
happen let me get another word in from a
Marshall PS on wall and then I'll get
both Prabhu dial and me general retired
Rajesh chharia to weigh in as well
here's the thing Marshall I think the
MEA spokespersons briefing also made it
clear this was the intention was to
attack a military installation that is
clearly an escalation from what India
stated position after India's air
strikes yesterday were that this was a
preemptive strike it was on a non
military installation the big variable
that's come into play here is the
capture of an Indian Air Force pilot how
does that change the the wargaming that
that India would have would have would
have thought through what when they
decided to launch the air strikes in the
first place is something like the
capture of a fighter pilot something
that you factor in well actually the
statement that they were hitting
military targets doesn't seem to gel
because the kind of ordnance that they
were carrying and the kind of routing
that they would have done the kind of
tactical flying they would have done
would have been totally different okay
like I mentioned earlier that they just
wanted to have a little bit of a
skirmish or show themselves at the LOC
and unfortunately it went a little
beyond that for instance our aircraft
actually the pilot ejected in Pakistan
occupied territory yeah and therefore he
became or he got into custody of the
Pakistani which is the most unfortunate
part and similarly the pakis also
launched an f-16 however the aircraft
dumped in their own occupied territory
and so did the pilot whose parachute was
opened and we could see him actually
landing by our troops around the
surrounding areas
so therefore it has become a situation
where actually I don't think if you say
you're going to hit our military
installations that's an act of war okay
I have no doubt about it yeah but here
it is a little fluid well where did this
happen like the pilot ejected of a pilot
and he landed in that Eritrea territory
so to me general area is here and I'm
sure you remember this vividly a - duck
- the case of flight left in a Chiquita
yeah this was at the height of the
Kargil war he was flying I think a
mig-27 at that time unfortunately his
his engine failed it crashed he ejected
he got caught by the Pakistani Rangers
there was a tense eight days where
negotiations were going on between India
and Pakistan eventually the flight left
Ninh was was get handed over to India
but we all very vividly remember the
condition in which he was returned as
akka once again I'll take 30 seconds
first of all my sympathies and my wishes
with to the families of this our brave
soldier pilot I have just saw seen a
tweet from general Kapoor
yeah that he is confessed in that tweet
first of all they don't have two pilots
they are bonded quite a number one at
6:25 he has tweeted right and second
thing is that pilot is being treated
with military ethics yes that's that's
that's a good thing and we have also I
just saw it mes launched at de March and
I also conveyed that they want are a
pilot to be treated well as per the
military norm yeah and I suppose you
never convention coming back to your
question it does not change anything it
does not change anything
a soldier is there the Air Force has
their drills there is a many chances
would be there where the pilot has
towards eject whether it is shot down or
an engine failure and it may land in the
enemy territory you know when you say it
doesn't change anything is that not a
serious variable to consider no whether
whether India decides to climb the
escalation ladder see that's what I'm
saying it does not it does not affect
that it does not it does not affect the
Indian strategy to war against terror
which is emanating from Pakistan
it adds to another dimension that now we
need to tell the Pakistan and I am
telling through your channel to journal
bajwa dammit if you consider yourself a
professional army take the soldier like
a soldier it is not today a be tomorrow
it could be a Pakistani pilot or a
Pakistani officer and if you don't treat
him well if you don't treat him as much
in a bar convention if you don't
evacuate him in a dignified manner
god save your boys through there well I
agree with general area that the Air
Force has its own manual its own set of
codes and that the Pakistani should
treat our prisoner of war in their
custody properly the Pakistanis are not
really known to be doing that because
their track record has been abysmal now
I agree with the Air Marshal and with
mr. Amit malya malya that didn't seem
logical that the Pakistanis with the
sort of payload that they were carrying
on the planes would attract they would
attack the military installation there
is a big hurry going around and I must
share with you that it was a trap the
Pakistanis came in knowing that we would
go in hospital jets and they thought we
would go further and they would shoot us
down our jet as it happened it crashed
but there is a fury that this was a trap
and that we fell for it if we have that
sequence of events I'm asking my
producers to put that out this is this
is what happened in terms of you know
the the sequence of events that led up
to the the downing of this mig-21 bison
which was being commanded by Wing
Commander I mean under what Amon let me
just play out those graphics on our side
window and see if we can you know just
just give a sense to our viewers here's
what happened there were a dozen
Pakistani jets that were right at the at
the line of control we're given to
understand that two of them crossed over
barely a couple of kilometers but
crossed over this was detected by Indian
Air Force Air Patrol
as a result there was a scramble jets
were scrambled the mig-21s were part of
it
there was a dogfight between these these
Pakistani Air Force jets and the Indian
Air Force jets which had been scrambled
the PAF comes in the 2-2 jets that came
in dropped what seemed like ordnance not
a lot of it but three sets about a few
hundred meters away from a military
installation we're not identifying that
military installation but certainly that
was not the target of the attack it was
a few hundred meters away from from that
military installation the Indian Air
Force jets which had been scrambled
which were in this dogfight chase back
the f-16s the f-16s go back to the other
side of the line of control where the
rest of the Jets were waiting the IAF
mig-21 bison which was being commanded
by Wing Commander up in London but Aman
shot down one of the f-16s in the chase
that f-16 fell on the other side of the
LC we know from eyewitnesses that the
pilot is at f-16 was seen ejecting the
parachute was seen as well he lands up
on Pakistani territory what happened is
the other PAF jets that were there on
the other side of the LC in Pakistani
airspace they hit captain up in London's
jet the jet falls down he ejects
unfortunately he happens to fall on the
other side he happens to fall in
Pakistan Occupied Kashmir the the DGI
SPR holds a press conference a little
past noon which is where it's first
revealed that they have an Indian pilot
India custody the MEA then subsequently
confirms that in the press conference
that they had at a little past 3 o'clock
a marshal Ahluwalia this is the sequence
of events I've just outlined this bare
bones to our viewers make sense of what
was going on here and and and where did
it go wrong examples a real live example
when I was commanding one squadron and
we that was the electronic warfare
capability also and we had sensors that
could pick up transmissions from the
enemy radars
now we were very keen to pick up the
f-16 transmissions because we knew that
they would be capping over Cohutta at a
certain specific time so we took off
from the desert
we went low level then we went high
level then again we went low level and
then we had some six or eight aircraft
from the other from our other fleet of
mig-21s 23 etc that they went straight
for Kota when these guys were capping
and sure enough these aircraft turned
around and rock down to these aircraft
which are coming for them and that's
exactly what we wanted because we had at
the back you know our reconnaissance pod
a sensor which would record all the
transmissions so it is it is a tactic
that is followed in the sky a tactic I
mean you it's not a straightforward
thing an air battle will require many
variables and it will be the skills not
only of flying the Aero planes but
visualizing the air situation as it
might be okay and one thing that should
have been certain was not crossing the
LOC because once you cross the LOC then
you are in no-man's territory so you
can't say that you came in and shot me
or I came in and shot you
so everything make it remains true it
you can't blame anybody it's a fluid
situation however what has happened now
is we have to be sure that a pilot is
treated well you mentioned about Nikita
yeah
now Hills aircraft no Chiquita it was a
mig-27 yeah he flied in salvo at a high
altitude and this make 27 cannot sustain
the engine cannot sustain with full
salvo firing so it flamed out and he was
returned but just imagine on the other
side what happened we had Squadron
Leader Ahuja who was actually capping
and looking to see where he's landed and
if he's landed safely and he got shot up
by a stinger and when he came back when
he came back the amount of grievous
injuries that he had because they had
killed him and they had killed him with
very grievous injuries we got the body
back but that's the way these Pakistani
will behave we don't wish that to happen
to jungwirth man who happens to be the
son
one of my colleagues when I was in the
Air Force at that time yeah I'm sure
that they will consider to send him back
safely and happily all right I'm also
joined by Serkan foreign policy expert
is joining us from Washington DC in
terms of how the global Capitals are
viewing this certainly we've had after
after yesterday's military airstrike by
India on the terror camps all global
capitals put out statements they said
India was well within its right to
respond to terror ah today after the
Pakistani response we've had expressions
of concern certainly from the French the
Americans we haven't heard directly yet
now we're given to understand that mr.
Trump will make phone calls to the
leadership of both India and Pakistan
how worried is the world today about
things slipping out of hand in the
india-pakistan context almost well thank
you for having me on your show
and I said well this actually simply
were in a mess you know Indian girls
have nuclear weapons and this is a
region which really only has to use
their powers that are neighbors so I
think that when people went the Capitals
thought that India would respond they
didn't realize about some would also
retaliate and how that would end up
going and the two things that kind of
are highlighted by this incident the
first is that box and military is very
capable which is something that we've
always known but I think it's very
obvious now and the second is that
nobody wants this to escalate into a
nuclear war this is that would be
devastating not only worth two countries
involved India and Pakistan but for the
whole region as well and so I think the
rest of the world is very much going to
try to ensure that both India and
Pakistan work towards the escalation and
work towards negotiation than peace
talks potentially Malviya in the
statements that were made yesterday by
Sushma Swaraj after the all-party
meeting we heard her today as well in in
China where she had gone for the RIC
summit and also the foreign secretary
when he first broke the news to the
world officially that India had
conducted airstrikes and hit the Baloch
otero camp
India consistently has said that India's
not wish to escalate do you believe that
that has changed today with the
Pakistani action you know Dhaka I think
in this position has remained consistent
and even in grave provocation we have
exercised but you know there is a memory
and I'm it go on sorry you know there is
there is a limit to which you can go and
be restrained in your response I think
what has happened so far has underlined
one simple point that India is not going
to take it anymore and Pakistan must do
everything possible to ensure that it
acts on various terror camps and jihadi
factories working in their soil and
that's also been underlined and
underscored by several countries whether
it's France or even China for that
matter in America and several of the
world powers now definitely there is
going to be a multi-pronged approach to
this entire situation it is going to be
diplomatic it is going to be military
offensive as well and it is also going
to be perhaps a tactical move if you
like that word but the timing of that
will be decided by the government in
consultation with the army and other
agencies and of course the diplomatic
offensive will continue to follow and
there has already raised the costs for
Pakistan by withdrawing the most favored
nation status it has also gone out to
say that we will look at now controlling
our share of water for example something
that we had not done in the past that
most of it flow to Pakistan so none of
these measures are going to be put in
but these do you do you do you do you
just one clarification of it today Imran
Khan spoke on television and he once
again reiterated that he's willing to
have a dialogue what is India's position
is the is the time for talks over or is
the time for talks now well I also heard
that the Pakistani Premier speak about
giving proof of attack and giving proof
that actually tell
are operating from the soil I don't know
what more proof does he need when Jesse
Muhammad admitted to having orchestrated
the Pulwama attack and talked about what
we have consistently said that we cannot
talk unless terror continues to emanate
from your soil
I mean if world order knows that there
are terrorist camps that are operating
and they are sort of unleashing terror
across the globe then why is it that
Imran Khan doesn't have a clue about it
okay or is it that he does not want to
admit you know doctor we've gone through
this exercise for the last several
decades I mean India has been at the
receiving end of it and so has the world
the issue is that today you need to have
a consensus and India is driving that
consensus India is driving diplomatic
offensive if you like and is also now
reserving the right to respond if it's
sovereignity or if its territorial
integrity is compromised and I think
today it is a multi-pronged approach
unlike earlier times were more defensive
we would want to have dialogue and
insist on it in Pakistan thought that
our restraint was our weakness but this
not the case anymore and let me also
make a point here you know you spoke
about Wing Commander a Bandhan who's now
in Pakistani captivity the fact remains
that Pakistan by parading him the way
they have done in the media have also
somewhere signaled that they want to
de-escalate and what they are putting
forward is more of a bravado and instead
of doing this it would have been better
had they made a resort to act against
the terror camps that are operating in
this world but that's something that's
not come true that tells you how serious
they are about this whole proposal about
having a talk okay I let me get from
Buddha would you take him around Khan's
offer of dialogue seriously coming as it
does today and to the manner in which
they paraded
Wing Commander Ben and then on video
footage and and so on he seems to be at
least in the in the second set of
footages that were released he seems to
be offered tea and he says that the
Pakistan Army has treated him
professionally but they haven't formally
and officially notified that they have
one of our men and unless that happens
you can't bring in the
CRC and the other international agencies
to take this process forward well you've
asked me many questions first of all the
issue of the dialogue yes a dialogue is
always preferable to escalation but the
dialogue onward what terms till the
attack on the Jewish terror camp across
the line of control and till this very
successful attack we were in a very good
bargaining position after one of our
fighter pilots has gone into Pakistani
custody the dynamics has changed a bit
the unforce is of course it's part of
the game when you are fighting and we
are part of the fighting force then you
should be prepared to be taken as a
prisoner of war but on the ground this
is a very important factor it's a motor
fact why would you say that because of
the fact that for the men on the street
for the media for the political parties
it's an issue on which they can raise
the decibel level and say that things
have been mishandled now it is in
everybody's interest that we work for a
dialogue but we can't be blackmailed
into a dialogue unfortunately the
presence of our fighter pilot and it is
being in custody in Pakistan because the
situation when the Pakistanis would try
to impose their conditions now we were
in a very strong position
internationally because the weight of
international opinion global opinion was
in our favor because Pakistan was being
viewed out-and-out as a country it's not
it's not like it's not like that force
to change in Pakistan's behavior no but
the fact of the matter is that Pakistan
it was in a weaker position militarily
economically and in terms of the global
outreach now having nothing it has one
of our pilots and
they paraded the pilot they pretend they
pretended to be treating the pilot very
well but at the same time there have
been a lot of visuals and pictures now
of how badly the pilot has been beaten
up and it
emotive issue let's face it we are all
human beings in general we remember when
captain Colliers yeah I know what you
were saying back you remember the
netiquette our episode I mean these are
factors you can't say that no no I said
so this is a fact that I said so this is
a factor and I also expect that the
Pakistan Army to behave as they claim to
be a professional army rights they
haven't in the past but that that's very
fluid I use the word they claim to be
okay and now they have paraded and
they've accepted it it is with them and
if they do anything inhuman that is
totally wrong on their part and we have
we reserve the right to respond really
respond to that but point is that that
you know you said the dialogue
ultimately after every war the
resolution comes out of a dialogue so I
am the one we if this terror is a
terrorist
issue can be resolved the dialogue by
all means do it but does a sincerity of
that exist if it is done purely to
discuss terrorism emanating from
Pakistan I think I don't mind going for
a dialogue dialogue I I said the more is
not the solution to everything right but
point point is earlier before this 26
February air attacks the dialogue was to
resolve other issues like gosh cash mean
and other trade and culture the dialogue
purely to discuss the issue of terrorism
emanating for Pakistan if the Pakistan
government offers this and more than the
Pakistan government is the Pakistan
coffers yeah that means they're
accepting it which which I'm not sure
will ever happen because we haven't seen
that happen in the aftermath of tyranny
as long as you see we have taken a first
step
it should not be misunderstood that we
have changed our stand we have taken a
step because the prime minister of a
country asked give me a proof we have
given if he said will not give you proof
enough but we have you know we are a
very mature state emotional alia do you
believe that now is the time for
dialogue in that the offer that Imran
Khan is made in his in his in his up you
know televised statement today should be
accepted by India or has the fact that
they have one of our fighter pilots
change the dynamic
see one is a question of optics and the
other is a question of what actually has
occurred now there is no time for any
more dialogues the time is for action
and we cannot trust them we cannot
believe in them like for so many decades
they have once again can you hear me
soccer yeah yeah I can't go out I mean
listen to you good money I can hear you
go on I can hear you sorry it's good
okay now I can hear you so so therefore
the time for dialogue is over do they
have to show their bona fides by
actually showing the actions that
they're taking against terrorism the
problem is that the army thrives on
terrorism the Pakistan Army the country
thrives on terrorism they export
terrorism their economy a major portion
of it is based on terrorism and
therefore you see what is happening in
Afghanistan there their finger of
Khorasan they're doing the same thing in
Iran they are actually into the Middle
East also so therefore it's going to be
very tricky for them to stop aiding and
abetting terrorism the only question is
that if we can help them avoid using
this terrorism or proxy war against
India now to be able to do that we've
got to put some cost on them and the
cost militarily we showed them yesterday
we will probably show them again in the
future but we will only be held back of
striking against the terrorism targets
terrorist targets now that is not going
to help so therefore you got to think of
other strategies and one of them could
be economically tie their hands behind
their backs you don't know you do not
believe you are marshal you do not
believe the response to what happened
this morning by the Pakistanis if India
were to choose to respond militarily
would be a hit on a Pakistani military
establishment no because the question is
they did not hit a military target okay
you can say they tried they didn't try
or whatever but the fact of the matter
is they did not hit a military target
the question is whether they cross the
LOC
or they didn't cross the LOC is another
question to be debated so I don't think
that India will take such a huge step by
attacking military targets because that
would mean the beginning of a
conventional war yeah that would mean
war and that could be a certain segment
of your border that will go into this or
the entire nation will have to go into
war but if MMR who says we we have hit a
terror target just yesterday we reserve
the right to hit other terror targets as
well in the future if Pakistan were not
to change its its behavior but we would
wait to see if there is any action on
the dossier that's been given if Imran
Khan will walk the talk as he has
claimed twice in the last two weeks and
then we reserve the right to hit another
non-military installation from where
terror is fermented in Pakistan you know
Dhaka we can hope against hope that the
current Pakistani regime will do
something about the dosa that's been
sent to them but I really doubt that
would be the case you know because we've
seen 26 11 and we've seen how a country
bled after that in several terror
attacks that happen and all of them had
their roots going back to Pakistan let's
be very clear and I think if you just
look at the statistics we probably lost
a lot more men during non-conflict times
so to say but is it about time that
India now look at how it deals with its
security issues its national security
and does India put in more options in
dealing with a neighbor such as Pakistan
which refuses to reign and people who
are actually salting us and you must not
forget this is using terror for end
objective is the stated policy of the
Pakistan this is see you dealing
country that in a way has no ethics it
has no template it wouldn't subscribe to
something that's ordinarily a deemed as
acceptable I not even quite sure if
they're worried about how they people
you know meet their ends or where the
economy is going and so on and so forth
it's a very different kind of
establishment which is essentially
directed and run by their military
military I guess given all these facts
and they haven't changed over the last
many decades India has to now change
gears it has to come up with new
strategies and it has to perhaps learn
to believe that it has to have a certain
military culture it needs to have a
certain security apparatus working for
it and I think in the last five years
it's held us in good stead okay the
number of terror attacks that we've
otherwise seen in cities such as Delhi
Bangalore Banaras and other places have
almost sort of dried up in the last few
years you're making steady I'll get okay
I'll get a final word from Shere Khan if
India were to hit a non military terror
installation in Pakistan again would
that be viewed as escalation by the rest
of the world absolutely because it is
excellent you to hit another target a
terrorist target or a military target or
non military target I think the issue is
also not just a matter of escalation but
it's also whether or not India and
Pakistan both want to have talks it
seems that the sentiment is that India
is not ready to talk and and the others
don't want to talk but I think the issue
is also what does India hope to achieve
by escalating the war with Pakistan I
don't think that both countries want to
be engaged in conventional warfare they
have fought Wars before and they have
both suffered certainly Pakistan is not
interested in fighting conventional
warfare if the goal is to ensure India's
goal is to ensure that Pakistan does not
use militant groups to attack its soil
then these kinds of conventional actions
are actually not going to stop groups
like Jason Mohammad and and other
Luschka death Aybar
or other groups that are operating in
soil so I think um before any sort of
escalation is done India also needs to
think about what it wants to achieve
with these targets all right because I
think the objective is clear that
Pakistan cannot use asymmetric warfare
as they have been for the last 25 or 30
years and continue to bleed India so if
India is raising of course I'm closing
I'm closing in if India is raising the
cause by doing what it did on the 26th
of February then that cost will get
heavier with each terrorist strike I
think that's the message they ought to
alter the status quo as we've known
since this is 1972 Shimla agreement
we'll see how the story moves forward in
the in the meanwhile thank you very much
mr shah lavalla Amit Malviya may General
Rajesh chharia and Prabhu they all for
joining us and Serkan for joining us on
skype from Washington I'm going to take
a break when we come back a 90-minute
long meeting at the Prime Minister's
residence has just concluded it had the
three service chiefs it had the National
Security Advisor they are obviously
plotting and planning what's going to be
the next step in light of what has
happened today
welcome back a high-level security
meeting convened by the Prime Minister
has just concluded moments ago was
attended by the National Security
Advisor Ajit all the forces of the
treaty the Chiefs of the three forces
that's the Army Navy and Air Force
chiefs as well as the intelligence
chiefs both of Raw and of the
Intelligence Bureau the Prime Minister
has been briefed by the National
Security Adviser about the situation
visa vie wing commander up in London
sources of also told CNN news 18 that a
free hand has been given to all Forces
commanders on the ground have been given
the option to decide what best course of
action they need to choose going forward
let me get Mario shekinah put it in
mentos getting more details on that
story
what more details can we share with our
viewers Mario yes that's how you pointed
out rightly the thing last before you
roughly 90 minutes is what we are being
told the National Security Advisor and
the three service fees were present and
also the ID head what we are also being
told it is that the final is sure as he
has often implicated on multiple
platforms that's a complete three man
has been given to the security forces
about the time and the place ask how
they want to go forward it's your own
words because look nice government is
certainly this that as far as the
escalation is concerned they may be that
may not happen immediately or what can
be the future course of action because
if you look at what Pakistan has done
there has been a degree of constant on
the government of India's side but the
fact that apart is funny Prime Minister
has initially talked about violence are
being dropped down and then going ahead
and then we to including a clarification
to Fiji is CR that there was one r1
which Samata a bonanza who is in
Pakistani custody I think the government
understands that there it is got a
fracture on them particularly from the
domestic constituency and that is the
reason why the Prime Minister conducted
this security meeting and thereafter the
NSC who was in touch with the primary
sexuality he had had several rounds of
precincts of the to the Home Minister
and others and also to the Prime
Minister
the Prime Minister now what yuppie
stores has given complete you know
complete control I would say to the
security forces and have given them the
decision to go ahead whatever they want
to do with all right so that that's the
detail that's coming out of that
high-level meeting that was convened at
the Prime Minister's residence and
locally unmarked the three service
chiefs Army Navy and Air Force chief who
were there so were the Chiefs of the
intelligence agencies and the National
Security Adviser they're leading the
proceedings giving the Prime Minister a
first-hand account of what is exactly
has happened with Wing Commander up in
London we're also given to understand
that in about 20 minutes time 2025
minutes time Prakash javadekar of the
BJP the Union HRD minister will be
having a press conference we're given to
understand that some video will be shown
at that press conference as well that of
course will be live here on CNN news 18

AxSlPKrIhtc,India&#39;s Decisive Battle Against The Terror Of Pakistan | Faceoff With Zakka Jacob,BreakingNews #IndiaStrikeBack #HindiNews #IndiaNews #LiveHindiNews #Pakistan #Pulwama #Airstrike #IndianAirForce India ...,2019-02-26T16:57:52Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AxSlPKrIhtc/hqdefault.jpg,"12 days ago a jesh suicide bomber rammed
an explosives Laden vehicle into a CRPF
convoy in polvo ma that attack killed 40
of our CRP of Jevons since then the
chorus for revenge and retribution has
been growing and early this morning at
half past three
India struck right at the heart of
terror inside Pakistan deep inside
Pakistan 12 mirage 2000 fighter jets of
the Indian Air Force flew deep inside
Pakistani territory and launched a
pre-emptive non-military strike in a 21
minute operation three jesh camps
including the biggest one which was
operating in Bala Court were razed down
to the ground there's nothing there but
rubble 350 plus terrorists have been
killed good evening and welcome to face
off on this momentous day a red-letter
day in India's history let's take you
through the details of this operation
which is bigger way way bigger than the
2016 surgical strikes it is arguably
bigger than anything that we have done
since the 1972 shimla agreement three
strikes the first one the biggest one
was at Bala court between 345 and 353 in
the morning that entire operation
lasting exactly eight minutes the entire
operation was just 21 minutes the second
strike three minutes past that at 348
this is Muzaffarabad which is the
capital the provincial capital of
Pakistan Occupied Kashmir that's the
second strike again lasts for about
seven minutes and the final strike on
the way back in back to their air bases
they hit choco tea which is very close
to the line of control which is barely a
few kilometers less than five kilometers
from the LC between 358 and 404 the
entire operation lasting for just
twenty-one minutes three places hit but
officially confirmation is now only
being given from official sources only
for that one big hit which happened in
Bala Court Pakistan and its response
well it has gone from one extreme to the
other at the outset it was outright
rejecting the airstrikes now they are
warning India that there will be a
surprise retaliation but the fact of the
matter is that today's action puts them
in a catch-22 and here's how and here's
why
Pakistan is in a catch-22 it is in a
corner because one it cannot accept that
there has been a successful air hit by
the Indian Air Force because if it does
it will expose the vulnerabilities not
only of an intelligence failure it will
certainly demoralize its forces it will
also raise domestic pressure for counter
strikes on a man who came to power
saying he's going to build in Naya
Pakistan number two a counter-attack in
an economy that is already in a tailspin
that is already in the doldrums remember
Pakistan has already knocked on the
doors of institutions like the IMF for a
bailout if there were to be retaliatory
strikes that would only further pile on
the debt burden that Pakistan is
currently surviving on it is surviving
on Chinese and Saudi doles our
neighboring countries you already have
an irate Iran Afghanistan they're
already blaming Pakistan for troubles
allies are warning them saying please do
not risk climbing the escalation ladder
America has little love for Pakistan
anymore and that's been made amply clear
in Donald Trump's tweets over the last
couple of years u.s. support militarily
is also drying up and Pakistan is
actually hanging by a very thin rope on
the F ATF's Grail list if it is seen as
striking back on India it could
potentially push them back further or
into the blacklist when that comes up in
October China its biggest ally it's
all-weather friend has already put out a
public statement calling for restraint
it is looking at Pakistan through the
economic benefits lens so clearly it is
a tough choice it's a Hobson's choice no
doubt for Pakistan how should they
respond should they respond at all just
hours after the airstrikes Prime
Minister Modi had a
clear message for the country that India
is in safe hands it was his first public
reaction after the airstrikes let's
listen in to that as well as all other
political reactions that have been
coming in and then I'll go straight
across to my panelists
[Applause]
maddis was Yoko this was a lotta home he
this surah sweetheart Omaha saga niveau

[Applause]
credible intelligence was received that
the Jasher Mohammed was attempting other
suicide terror attacks in various parts
of the country and the Fedayeen jihadis
were being trained for this purpose in
the face of danger a preemptive strike
became absolutely necessary
the alert land training is our thing I'm
sure the Ibiza planning generating for
carrying out a strike a contingency to
discuss over unique a other Pakistan
kids are obsequious retaliation attack
our patience has been stretched beyond
limit and you've seen in the wake of
full ma full wama the whole nation has
been United in their concern and in
their anguish and their anger I think we
have acted resolutely and firmly the
question we're asking tonight on face
off has India drawn a new line as far as
terror is concerned what has changed
today many are calling this a red-letter

editor with Network 18 general retired
VP Malik is former chief of army staff
uses chief of army staff when Cargill
happened gvl narsimha Rao is Member of
Parliament and senior leader of the BJP
emmechelle RK Sharma is form a wise
chief of the Indian Air Force Arjun
Subramanyam is a vice marshal retired
and we're hoping to be joined by Michael
Coogan from the Woodrow Wilson Institute
in a moment or two but Praveen let's
let's start with you explain at the
outset to our viewers why is today
different what has changed today at
least to Indian prime ministers have
grappled with precisely this situation
in the past
Prime Minister Vajpayee faced this
dilemma after the attack on Parliament
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh faced
exactly the same situation after 26/11
on both occasions the idea was there to
use the Air Force to strike at targets
yeah inside Pakistan and on both
occasions for a variety of reasons right
or wrong both prime ministers walked
back today you've hit not just
targets just across the line of control
which the Indian Army has often done in
the past
to its credit but struck deep inside
Pakistan at a terror facility which has
been known to exist since 2003 2004
they've been satellite images pictures
propaganda videos coming about this okay
this is really a hit at the heart of the
jesh the question I guess is what next
what next okay let me get general Malik
and he was Chief of Army Staff when
Kargil happened and we know there have
been multiple accounts different people
at that time have written books about
how this option was told to then Prime
Minister Vajpayee during the Kargil war
and subsequently of course as I said
after after the Parliament attack as
well but a political call was taken not
to cross the LC today India has altered
the status quo explained to us the
significance of what has happened today
firstly Xhaka let me talk about Kargil
war the circumstances were totally
different diplomatically we were on the
backfoot because we had carried out
nuclear tests yeah and the international
community in fact started calling us a
rogue nation and everybody was hawk-eyed
on us as to what action are we going to
take secondly we didn't have exact
information of the kind of information
that is available today so the
circumstances those days were such that
we had to start with both military
challenge as well as a diplomatic
challenge yeah and then we had to
overcome that and I thought we succeeded
in getting the international community
from earlier going against us to then
coming in our favor
and of course military actions also
helped us by then we started recapturing
all the heights that they had taken ok
those circumstances are quite different
and the circumstance is available today
are different today there is no doubt
there is a paradigm shift in political
decision-making and there is also a
strategic shift because of the political
decision that we have now stepped up the
ladder as far as our reaction is
concerned earlier we used to take
tactical action today is a very clear
strategic action that we have taken ok
and it has nothing to do with territory
it has nothing to do with Tok it has it
is a fight against terrorism
yeah the response has been measured
it is pre-emptive it is self in
self-defense
so the message that has gone very
correctly is that look we have now taken
steps forward we have climbed the ladder
but it is again a purely
counterterrorism action yeah I tell you
you've described it very well community
general I think you've described it very
well because the phraseology used by the
foreign secretary who put out the
official briefing today was also that
this is a pre-emptive non-military hit
but let me get a word in from GBL
narsimha Rao because clearly this had to
be a political call the Prime Minister
had to give the go-ahead now that it
emerges that we've hit not just in P
okay but deep inside Pakistani territory
Bala code is in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
incidentally the province that Imran
Khan hails from for variety of reasons
both Prime Minister's watch me and Ramon
Singh chose not to exercise this option
Prime Minister Modi has chosen to
exercise today's option
what changes from today on zakah I think
about ninety nine now general Milito
Ewings just now what was the context
this was soon after the nuclear test
certainly I think a diplomatic support
was not forthcoming as now but 26/11 was
a major major terrorist action I think
possibly the biggest terror strike in
India ever 26/11 yeah and we have a
funny homie a thief marshal retired who
says who actually was on record a few
months ago saying that they had
suggested this option as a surgical
strike a surgical strike they had
proposed but somehow there was not
support or clearance forthcoming this
time there is clearly political will and
this government and on the prime
minister also has the International
Health and standing and over the last
four and half years we have we he has
been able to we have been able to
leverage his his standing as
International leader certainly to our
advantage and certainly we have got
after the surgical strikes all the major
countries of the world rallying behind
us and even before even this attack was
mounted I think we have support a coming
forthcoming from President Trump to
France to Russia China from every
country every major part of the world so
certainly this is this this strike could
be carried out because of the political
will and certainly our forces I think
they need a major salute for the
flawless manner in which they have
executed they have demonstrated to the
world their professionalism their
capability and political will diplomatic
strength coupled with the military might
actually has demonstrated India's
capability to secure its sovereignty to
secure to ensure its security and this
is certainly something the whole world
has has examined or as the best part is
that all 12 Mirage 2000s came back there
was not a scar on any one of them let me
get the two air force men in for because
this option was always there let me get
a Marshall RK Sharma first to weigh in
and then ever special Arjun Subramanyam
the the risk associated with any kind of
air strike was that it would
automatically mean you are signaling
your intention of climbing the
escalation ladder that was the big risk
always involved today by framing it as a
preemptive hit on a non-military
installation is India trying to convey a
message to the Pakistanis that look this
is one time this is a hit on a
non-military installation and this is a
hit to prevent a further terror strike
on Indian territory therefore we have no
intentions of escalation
a much larger Sharma you know this is
the common perception that use of air
power whether it is against you know
non-state actors terrorists or force and
force is automatically escalatory it is
not so I mean in the last 2025 years
you can't name any operation that has
taken worldwide we're a very decisive
force and force order against terrorists
which has not been led by air operations
because that is the instrument of choice
for the simple reasons the kind of
characteristics of employment where part
that it brings to the table for the
decision-maker which is essentially
flexibility surprise speed and accuracy
so why were we so exercised it it is
also true that in the past that is also
- in the past there has been education
at the level of decision makers to use
this instrument yeah so I think I really
applaud the government for for having
made this decision that we will use it
then let me be fair you know it's also
not possible for our ground forces to go
into the depths and utilize the targets
that they were there because there were
few kilometers inside to several
kilometers inside the you know the
adversary's territory so this was the
instrument that is available in the
table and despite the hesitations that
have been shown in the past I think the
government has done a wonderful job by
going at with this that said you know
somewhere down the line you said that we
will this is it and we will not do this
again or something of that again I said
that the intention was this was a
one-time hit no who said that I don't
know why you you don't sort of presume
that it's a one-time hit look the door
is open okay we have crossed the Rubicon
and I think there is a clear message to
the other side that this is now going to
be the new normal it was not a game of
cards you know I've played one card
you've played the other card now wait
for my card if we have actionable
intelligence real-time that this is it
and this is going to hurt our nation be
sure about it this government will not
hesitate okay who's this instrumentation
I I like your choice of phrase crossing
the Rubicon and let me put that to Arjun
Subramanyam a vice marshal if this
indeed is a crossing the Rubicon moment
then the natural question to ask is what
next
clearly I outlined at the top of the
show what options the Pakistanis have in
there they have very few good options ah
but they can't be seen as doing nothing
they can't be seen as sitting on their
hands
what next and what should we be prepared
for okay before I answer that question
let me try and give you an operational
practitioners perspective of how we felt
about these kind of issues over the last
twenty years you know when we were
youngsters in you know Mirage squadron
in the in in the 90s we we used to
wonder as to why we are not adopting a
policy of hot pursuit why we can't hit
camps along the line of actual control
line of control which had sprung up all
along and then ad and then we realized
that it was a it was this desire for
India to be seen as as a responsible and
restrained power that always held us
back and we were willing to sort of we
were willing to bleed to uphold that
particular image and in that context we
crossed the rubicon line to say that
this much and no more we're willing to
sort of transit from reactive to
proactive deterrence and punitive
measures are no longer a no-no when it
comes to our when it comes to our
response mechanisms okay with that what
next now that that's dependent on many
many variables one variable is already
showed its cards and that's China
China has called for restraint because
it's more worried about the economic
card the next issue is Pakistan itself
Pakistan no longer is in a position to
sort of spontaneously react they will be
a lot of soul-searching within Pakistan
itself they they will be both sort of
constituency's reflecting on whether a
response mechanism is due or whether
they need to wait and watch and the last
issue that has to be kept in mind is
that irrational factor which was brought
up in your previous conversation so from
India's side I think hardening is is an
issue I just wanna be hard do you
believe the response if at all one comes
from Pakistan will necessarily be Air
Force LED
no I don't believe I do not believe that
that the response if any will be air
force lane I will argue that Pakistan
will continue see continue seeing value
in prosecuting a covered war because
that's where they have faced success or
that's where they've had success over
the last two decades okay
Praveen I do now sorry I I couldn't
what's important is that the flavor the
flavor of the covered response may
change okay okay I I would actually I
would actually go with that I mean
there's there's been talk in closed
Pakistan army what's that groups which
we've been following all day about you
know ratcheting up things saying that we
must create at least the illusion of a
nuclear apocalypse looming if our
deterrence is to be credible
but I think when sobriety sinks in after
the shock and rage Pakistan is going to
think hey you know you know what we
actually have a pretty good gig going in
Kashmir for the cost of some semi
educated idiot from village somewhere a
second-hand car and a few kilos of RDX
we have inflicted a loss of India of 40
highly trained highly educated valuable
Security Force personnel we are forcing
Indian paramilitary forces now to fly
people at great cost at various lengths
this is working for us they're going to
step it up they did that after 2016
after the cross line of control strikes
when in 2017 and in 2018 they use
Fedayeen to make Armed Forces bleed well
then they did in past years no but but
so far if I'm if I made their response
so far has been an extension of the
response that we saw in the aftermath of
the surgical strike which is denial
which is denial and confusion on the one
hand they're saying they're going to get
revenge on the end of this you know they
say nothing happens so you don't know
yet retaliate absolutely that's what a
covert war strategy is you use proxies
to do the state's business for you it's
what they've been doing for 20 years
okay the thing is the Prime Minister
knows this after this in an interview in
January he turned around and I
paraphrase but he said basically if you
think Pakistan will change its behavior
because of a surgical strike that's
stupid it's not and if you think
Pakistan is gonna change its behavior
because of an airstrike it's not but
what we've signaled today is that every
time you do this we're willing to hit
back and that's what really changes the
calculus here there is a heavier cost to
pay I think that's that's really what's
change today
let me get Michael gubelman in for a
perspective from Washington because we
haven't officially heard from the White
House or the or the State Department but
I must give it to to Donald Trump for
the statement that he put out a couple
of days ago that India wants to be seen
as doing something big I guess this is
what he was referring to my question is
this how may the international community
respond to this we've already seen the
response from Beijing they've called for
restraint we haven't seen any major
world power come out and say that India
has done an irresponsible thing and I
think that's telling I do think that the
United States certainly supports quietly
supports what India has just done and
John Bolton made that very clear in his
phone conversation with Ajit Doval
earlier this month when he basically
said that the u.s. supports India's
right to self-defense so I think that
the u.s. is certainly behind what India
is supportive of what India has done
here with this operation but I do not
think that the US or any member of the
international community for that matter
wants things to escalate further I mean
be from the u.s. perspective you know
stability on South Asia's essentially as
paramount interest or stability is its
paramount interest in South Asia so you
know the role that the United States
plays in this is unclear to me I
certainly do not see the Trump
administration as one that is well
suited to crisis diplomacy and of course
Trump himself is in North Korea now I
imagine there will be conversations
between US officials and their
interlocutors in both Pakistan and India
but I don't see the United States taking
on a major role here and we're trying to
defuse tensions unless things really get
out of what about what about the
Pakistani response it said then you're
an expert in Pakistan how would they
choose to respond when Imran Khan goes
on the air and says this is Naiya
Pakistan we will not just think about
retaliating but will will
and then he can't be seen as doing
nothing Kenny well I mean no Pakistani
politician worth his or her salt would
go on TV and say oh we're not going to
do anything after this attack we're just
gonna sit here so clearly you know Khan
and other Pakistani leaders have to talk
tough but you know I agree with what
your other guest has said that
Pakistan's options it's retaliatory
options are limited at least in the
sense of the conventional military force
I mean we know that Pakistani
conventional military forces pale in
comparison to those of India so I do
think that Pakistan is best option you
know unfortunately is to intensify what
it has already done for several decades
and that is to look to these militant
proxies these what it how it what it
views is these asymmetric assets use
them to try to hit back at India in ways
that its conventional military forces
cannot because I simply don't see what
the Pakistani military could do it
simply has very few options here okay
very few options I'd love to go to
general Malik but I believe his line has
gone off for a moment we'll try and fix
that but but GVL if that is the case and
in the consensus on the panel seems to
be that you know Pakistan military's
responses are very limited
they're just fraud they'll have to
choose from a whole set of bad options
and they will continue to do this
asymmetric warfare this covert
operations because a cost-benefit
analysis sort of benefits them if that
is the case what today has effectively
achieved is in a sense at some level
call out the nuclear bluff because
that's that's the doomsday scenario that
everybody was painting that look if we
were to have you know hit them in air
strikes if you were to break the
protocol of not breaching the LC
something that's been in existence since
1972 the Shimla agreement then obviously
you would ratchet up you would climb up
the escalation ladder and and and at the
top of the escalation ladder is of
course nuclear weapons what you
effectively done today if the response
from Pakistan is going to continue to be
covert warfare is to call out that
nuclear Bluff
no Sokka that that Bluff was called long
ago I think that after the surgical
strikes two years ago rather two and a
half years ago I think we have heard
similar statements in the run-up to the
surgical strikes in in 2016 but then
there was absolutely no response because
they were incapable of giving a response
but today I think it's time for us to be
certainly prepared because whatever be
their limitations I think it's important
for us to be on on high vision and also
we have demonstrated that every attempt
a very terror strike that you do in
India we will certainly strike back at
the terror camps in in Pakistan and we
have not said this is the only such
instance I think there are several such
terror camps in Pakistan and certainly
this is the beginning we have clearly
signaled that we will we will we will
certainly we will go for a strike aerial
strike this could be something else next
time there is also a surprise element we
have told them this time that we will
strike back and then we have done that
in a manner of less than two weeks and
through the aerial route and Pakistan
was not able to even detect it I think
it certainly it shows the
professionalism of the Indian forces and
we will certainly they will not mistake
they will not certainly take this chance
that India will not retaliate again if
they were to attempt anything sinister
yet in the form of a terror strike or
anything similar prove it this business
of the nuclear buff the bluff Sokka I
mean for 20 years people like me and
people like some of the other panelists
have been on television saying it's time
to give the Pakistanis a bloody nose and
that's wonderful to say if you're a
journalist or commentator but I spare a
little sort of if you like pity for
governments who have to make these
decisions both Prime Minister Vajpayee
after Parliament after the attack on
Parliament and Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh after 26/11
decided not to go down that route
because they said look we'll go and bomb
something but the next
thing you know is they will bomb
something in one of our cities and we'll
get locked into a tit for tat tit for
tat and Indian public patience you know
we'll just where it'll rebound on the
government and that's fair enough these
are these are things that governments
need to worry about but I think what's
really dramatic today and nobody
imagines that an airstrike across the
line of control crosses Pakistan's
nuclear red lines yeah but what's really
important today is what we've told the
Pakistanis is actually we know you can
set off a bomb in one of our cities we
know you can blow up the bus up but you
know what we'll take that chance and we
will make you pay for it if you do it
okay that's the really big step forward
that's happened that's a big chance
chunks now remember again Prime Minister
Modi saying one surgical strike ain't
going to cut it yeah this is going to
work if for the next five or ten years
you have a consistent practice of
retaliation
whenever something big happens okay
general Malik is is back on the line
with us so far what we've seen in the in
the 12 plus hours since these airstrikes
have happened is that motor shelling
across the LC as well as the
international border is increased
I believe in 50 different locations
across both DLC and and and the IB motor
shelling has increased from the
Pakistani side but that's expected
that's conventional and we are probably
prepared for the conventional are we as
Praveen suggests prepared for the
unconventional Xhaka firstly let me talk
about this nuclear threshold business
yeah I have always believed and I have
said it publicly that there is space
between the kind of conventional action
that we have on the ground and the
nuclear threshold there is a gap
available in fact I've been promoting
that concept for a long time and of
course some people didn't like it but I
have always believed that there is space
for dimensional limited war for both
parties to do it they did it in Kargil
and we can also do something similar now
I believe Pakistan has got two paths to
follow if they follow the conventional
war path and they have a military
response against our military I have a
feeling
they will get a bloody nose because we
are far superior we will be able to give
them a bloody nose and it would be very
costly for them both in terms of
military as well as economically they
are not in a good position today to
fight back or to take it for much
distance really but what will happen or
what may happen is what they did after
Kargil war yeah in fact after Kargil war
they intensified the terrorist
activities in J&K and we had a hard time
almost one and a half to two years to
again get that situation under control
my own feeling is and that is going to
be more likely that they will again make
use of their strategic assets and carry
out terrorist action or continue to
carry out this terror section because
they are expendable for them they are
the cheaper option for them both in J&K
and maybe even elsewhere so be helping
keep our God intact they have to remain
alert sure and for those kind of actions
let me get Michael I believe Michael
will be leaving us in a moment or two
but Michael a final word just in terms
of how made this if at all it will
change the nature of the relationship or
at least temporarily the nature of the
relationship between Imran Khan and the
army as bad as today was for Imran Khan
and I know there were slogans in the
Pakistan National Assembly against Imran
Khan he must be seen as doing something
after all that bluster of this is Naiya
Pakistan will retaliate so on and so
forth isn't the general general bajwa
worse off today then perhaps Imran Khan
is is in the Pakistan Air Force chief
probably worse off today than Emraan
Kahn is I mean they couldn't even
scramble their Jets for an effective
response to the Indian Indian air
strikes ah
would this weaken the hand of the armed
forces and as a consequence possibly
strengthening Ron Khan's hand I don't
think so given the dynamics of Pakistan
which you're which you're well aware of
the military will always be able to
reassert its clout and its influence and
you know the way that the army has been
projecting what happened today you know
has been trying to convey a sense of
strength even if the military does come
out looking bad and all this so no I
mean short answer to your question
the civil military relationship is
actually quite strong in Pakistan these
days because Imran Khan I think really
sees eye-to-eye with the Army on many
key issues in the country and certainly
when it comes to matters like India and
and security policy and foreign policy
on the whole so no I think that you know
in Pakistan people will rally behind
their leadership the civilian and the
military leadership especially when it
comes to an issue like this there's
nothing to rally the masses like an
attack on the country by by India and of
course the Pakistanis will will will
spin this very differently than the
Indians have so so no I don't really see
any any weakening of the army I think
that it'll continue to be continued to
maintain the clout that it's already at
it'll survive this and weather this
storm quite easily what wouldn't the
Pakistanis need a fall guy to take the
blame for this but I mean we know the
who the fall guy was after Kargil it was
Nawaz Sharif would Iran can't be the
fall guy understand I very much doubt it
I have the Pakistan Army knows here that
the best option it has on the spectrum
before it is Imran Khan he's the only
guy they have who will pretty much do
what they tell him to who doesn't really
have a mass base Kadir organized mass
base that will take them on in anyway
will be a good boy and they'll have the
good boy there and they'll deal with
this the reality I have to agree with
Michael Cougar Minh on this the reality
is in Pakistan there is no other
institution that is a serious challenger
with EFT to the public to the Pakistan
Army so they're expect businesses but
what about the political pressure that
Imran will face already I mean nor
should whose party is is talking against
him sodadi is rust ratcheting up the
pressure there will be political
pressure published they will absolutely
be political pressure there will be
baying of blood and remember you know
the things he said about Abbottabad
about her Zardari then about Nawaz
Sharif reaching out to India absolutely
no doubt in my mind that some of those
generous compliments of his will be paid
back by the gentlemen concerned okay
having said that in Pakistan we've seen
this before Nawaz Sharif is in prison
the surgeries are not really in play
you know in any big way when the army
tells people to fall in line they will
fall in line so even from Shahbaz Sharif
we've seen this you know nonsense
polemic about hitting back yeah
don't expect any significant political
fallout the one sort of caveat I would
put to that dough and I wonder is that
we live in a social media age so you've
had this denial about these attacks and
the rest of it going on but there's no
doubt in my mind that in the next two or
three days video footage from the area
will start circulating more stories will
circulate what kind of pressure is that
going to mount on Imran especially his
young audience who dragged all day to
whatsapp what ways will that affect his
behavior let's put that to a
vice-marshal
audience of Romania as well as to a
martial arcade Sharma let Arjun take
that question in terms of you know today
we had the Pakistanis taking out a PT
and crew and and Reuters crew to that
location we don't know what was shown to
them but from the from the footage that
they have put out it seems like there
was limited damages very well possible
then they didn't take them to the actual
location where the hits happen much like
they did for the surgical strike so
that's part of the PlayBook that's part
of the deny plausible deniability
strategy more importantly in this day
and age of social media where I don't
think it'll take too long for for the
reality to emerge we already had BBC who
do put out reports about local saying
that they've heard loud explosions in
the early morning hours
how may that force the hand if it will
Arjun Subramanyam off of the Pakistan
government firstly it's a battle of
narratives it's always been it's always
been a battle of narratives and it will
be no different this time there are
three quick points that I want to put in
the correct context you know before I
before I answer your question one is
that in terms of a paradigm you talked
about a paradigm shift there's been a
paradigm shift from the Indian
perspective of following a policy of
reactive deterrence to sort of
subscribing to something that has been
talked about in the recent past of
proactive deterrence the second is I
think the Indian strategic establishment
is no longer scream
about issues of punitive action and
punishment so these will not be sort of
taboo anymore when it comes to the
indian security establishment and these
will be looked at under the umbrella of
still being seen as a responsible and a
restraint state that has that
understands the role of force and
statecraft the next issue is as far as
the narrative how the narrative unfolds
the narrative unfolds
I don't think whatever way the narrative
plays will change the texture of
Pakistan's response because the cupboard
responds I will repeat it again and
again the cupboard response seems to be
the best option for Pakistan in the
given circumstances for the pure and
simple reason that the cupboard option
allows a group of non-state actors
diffused non-state actors to act within
the OODA loop of an established state
yeah and that's something that will be
exploited by Pakistan rather than a
force on force engagement as a martial
but but if there is a cost to pay very
quickly if there is a cost to pay as
India has demonstrated today and if that
cost is too high and increases with
every terrorist strike then isn't there
the law of diminishing returns yeah
absolutely there will be a law of
diminishing returns and you know just as
just as the covered actors or the proxy
actors always come out with something
new new targets new new new operational
methodologies
similarly the Indian security
establishment the Indian Air Force the
army will have to constantly reinvent
themselves to offer a befitting response
to - to cover responses okay
a-a-a marshal RK Sharma in terms of
controlling the narrative and and this
is what I find befuddling because the
first official communication was put out
by the Pakistani side the Indian side
the first official communication came
from the foreign secretary at half past
11 o'clock this morning but it was the
tweets from the DGI SPR first he said it
was the release of a payload then he
said we scrambled our jets they went
back and by evening it became our you
know they've hit this empty spot in
valor code
and there will be a fitting response it
will be a surprising response I mean
what is the attempt here how is Pakistan
responding if they are trying to control
the narrative one doesn't get the
impression that they are doing a good
job of it they're doing a pretty hashed
job of it
I think yeah I think the narrative were
actually spoken for itself you know
people in your panel have talked about
you know the the Pakistan which meant
being in a denial mode for domestic
political reasons so so be it you know
we had to do what we were asked to do
and that has been done successfully
whether they want to be in a denial mode
or not is really up to them that is not
the point the point is should there be
missed behavior on the part of that
establishment then be sure the reactions
like this will be revisited that is what
needs to be understood the rest is all
storytelling you know our Jets got
airborne and somebody went off look when
you cross that LC and you go and strike
the target you are in enemy territory
for not more than six minutes and you
are back in six minutes that is it in 12
minutes
I'll be surprised if a jet could get
airborne who needs five minutes of
response time to get airborne thereafter
have to be revealed to be vectored from
an airfield which is 200 kilometers away
there is no question you know this is
the sort of thing our Air Force pilots
train offensive strike pilots train for
day in day out it is not new and this
entire strike force was accompanied by
air defense and you know resources so
you forget about that as professionals
we know this is storytelling from their
side okay god they got a Kino keep their
sort of quality appear etc leave that
alone I don't think we need to will you
don't give that a thought in terms of
how this may play out domestically GBL a
super ow yes you know give credit where
it is due because at the end of the day
and intervene outline this beautifully
at the start of the program there was
political unwillingness both when mr.
Vajpayee was prime minister after
Cargill as well as when mr. Manmohan
Singh was prime minister after 26/11 to
cross the Rubicon one of the phrases
that one of the guests used on the on
this panel so give political credit
where it's due Prime Minister Modi has
given that go-ahead and that's why this
operation took place but
from political credit to votes it's not
a it's not a it's not too far far a
bridge to cross and and it would be an
unfortunate bridge to cross would you
reckon no Sokka no Sokka you see our
national security is is certainly a very
important part of the overall governance
package so certainly this government and
Prime Minister Narendra Modi have
demonstrated a very very little ship of
a very high order on this particular
area and I'm sure people of this country
recognize this whether we speak about it
or otherwise people certainly know this
is where leadership really this is the
difference in approach now and after
26/11 is clearly the leadership and
certainly the fact that we also have a
parliamentary majority is an important
factor and I would I think we should be
absolutely we should be we should be
telling people the by giving up a
majority government by strengthening the
hands of the Prime Minister you have
actually allowed him to make decisions
which actually that has given him an
international stature and also it has
given him the capacity to decide
whatever is the national interest so
certainly this will play on the minds of
the people not necessarily as a partisan
issue but certainly as an important
issue for the people of the country to
ponder over if Obama can go back and
seek a second term on the back of
killing Osama bin Laden then mr. Modi is
well within his rights to go back to the
people and say that I have done
something that no Prime Minister before
me has done
political parties everywhere in the
world will try and take credit for
whatever they do and that's how it
should be mr. narsimha Rao is completely
right I think what many of the military
experts on this panel may also share my
concern is very very often many of these
debates in our country get dragged into
partisanship mr. narsimha Rao for
example
criticize Manmohan Singh's handling of
26/11 but not mr. mudge by his identical
handling of the post Parliament attack
situation and if there was a
congressperson there right now he would
be doing the opposite thing in no robust
democracy does this happen on national
security issues if you look at the
United Kingdom if you look at Israel if
you look at the United States the
leaders of the Opposition and the ruling
party have a coherent consensus on the
broad contours of national security
policy and what needs to be done there
will be a price to be paid for what we
have done today it would be very
unfortunate if that price when it has to
be paid becomes an issue for
point-scoring
it would be unfortunate if what happened
today became an opportunity for
point-scoring
and i can only pray that leaders on all
sides of our politic political spectrum
will have the maturity to say look this
is something we need to do and we need
to stand together on this without
sniping at each other gentleman I'll
give you the final final word so far at
least in the aftermath of Obama we have
seen the kind of political unity which
there I say we haven't seen you know in
a very long time so it would be a real
shame it would be a real tragedy if this
you know unprecedented step that we've
taken certainly something that we
haven't taken since 71 were to be
politically milked for or attacked on
either side as we approach the elections
oh are you asking me
generally cap final word oh yeah I
totally agree with Praveen Sami and I
always believe that national security
always comes before politicking within
the country I whatever be our ideologies
inside and it was a good sign that we
saw yesterday and today and I hope this
kind of an atmosphere will continue and
this requires constant consultation also
you know keeping each other briefed as
it has been done now and there is no
doubt about it that national security
and whatever kind of reaction that we
can expect we should be prepared for it
not by the government alone but all
parts are all parties political parties
as well as the citizens of our country
or and that is the way to fight a war
it cannot be fought by one political
party which is in power it is the whole
nation that has to fight a conflict like
this and today we are fighting that war
on terror I I will I will tell you this
I mean in the aftermath of Palama
you know you could you could walk into
ordinary residential societies in in
Delhi and in Bombay and in Bangalore and
people felt hurt people felt like
India's pride had been wounded people
felt like something needed to be done
and something needed to be seen to be
done and today that has happened I'm not
saying that this is the end of
everything I'm not saying that this is
you know going to cease the problem of
terror from across the border but
certainly one thing that has come out
loud and clear is that for Pakistan if
they're going to use covert means if
they're going to use this you know
bleeding India by a thousand cuts there
is a heavy price to pay and that price
just got a little heavier today I'm
going to thank all my guests thank you
very much for joining us we've had a as
sane and discussion as possible I'd
imagine

accepted without the lens of their

caught viral in the university and I
started to get the calls and message
regarding the same so I contacted my h
OD in the like 12 was at the night in
the night and she sent me to wait till
morning
and on 17th of Feb 1 day I like applied
for the leave because I was feeling
personal insecurity so I went approached
our office of LPU where I discuss a
matter with the ma'am and she was like
ok it's not such a big deal let's deal
with it it's not such like you have not
spoken anything wrong but she saw the
chair at that time but then she
contacted those two students who made
this viral and who photoshopped it and
those two students were like they
promoted that in such a manner that she
didn't lessen anything to me she neither
investigated nothing else she said that
we are giving you two options either you
suspect like we will suspend you and

instances of cash wheelies facing

been underreported simply because they
are too scared to speak out
fearing harassment young Kashmiri
Muslims in Delhi are trying to be
invisible it was hard to convince them
to speak on camera those who chose to do
it was away from their neighborhood and
walk cases you clean washed you are evil
and you people are ruining our country
and then I was like okay your country
and then you asked us which we are an
important part the Kashmiri is as good a
Kashmiri as good an Indian as any other
Indian it's not a piece of land which is
yours it's the people who ops what does
it feel like to be a Kashmiri in rest of
India I feel cheated now I feel cheated
on the fact that there was a trust
factor that you know all of this is just
political drama all of this heat is just
on media channels but today I see it on
the streets today I see it from my
school friend so I feel cheated there
one of my school friends said that on
Facebook that you know because Kashmir
E's agree on certain lines with these
people it's okay to murder them and it
was a shock because I studied with that
person for 16 years it's like someone is
being targeted for their ethnicity and
that very ethnicity makes you feel alien
in a space you know it happened with me
on the very first day of the attack when
I returned back from work I reached home
I was getting off the cab and I thought
he wait what if people start seeing me
as a Kashmiri on the street what do I
tell them you know it was a moment it
was a sense of guilt that you know those
person who carried out their attack was
a Kashmiri and am i guilty by
association
broken friendships lost jobs interrupted
plans the fallout of pivara attack a
manifold after the immediate anxiety
over survival passes questions of
alienation and belongingness and the

their countrymen will be asked and the

in 2010 when Shopp Azal became the first
Kashmiri to top the is exam he was
celebrated a beacon of hope a brilliant
Kashmiri who had put his faith in the
Indian state
he was fetid and held up as a role model
to young Kashmiri ten years later it's a
completely different story
he squid the is and he wants to use
electoral politics to get in there to
prioritize a resolution to the Kashmir
issue an issue which was spotlighted in
devastating manner on February 14th when
a young Kashmiri suicide bomber killed
40 CRPF men and left many others injured
to assess the impact of this on Kashmir
and Kashmir is living across the country
my off-centre conversation today is with
Shah Faisal thank you for talking to us
we are speaking in the backdrop of this
tragedy that's playing out even as we
speak across the country what was your
first reaction when you heard about this
news of the CRPF convoy being targeted
it has been a devastating experience for
me personally I am somebody who has been
in the field for quite some time and we
have been hearing the news of encounters
deaths and killings almost on air on a
daily basis but when I heard that an X
and an X an incident of this magnitude
happened believe me it made me feel that
something sinister is going to follow
and I was totally in shock it was a
suicide bombing and we had not heard of
this something and for me who has been
kind of looking at the security
situation it's like a watershed moment
for Kashmir and for rest of the country
what is interesting for me to hear is
that you are calling it a watershed
moment it's a turning point in so many
ways one we have never seen an incident
of this magnitude this many killings
happening in one incident in the last 30
years that makes it unprecedented second
the way in which it happened
you're the kashmiri carrying an
explosively
explosive-laden van and then hitting it
on a target this has never happened
kashmiris are the people who till 10 20
years back they would hire somebody to
kill their chicken this is a community
about which for last couple of hundreds
of years people have been saying that
they cannot even hurt an insect and now
you have the same Kashmiri guy a
youngster who is I mean in his teenager
who's just crossed his teenage he's
doing a deadly attack on he's doing a
deadly attack like that this is
unprecedented so when you saw that video
message that Adele a mad dog put out
when he says he should be seen as a
martyr for Islam he's been quoted as
saying the war that they can't win with
force they're trying to win by
compromising your belief they want to
mislead you from the etiquettes of Islam
they want to mislead you from the path
of Islam by luring you with worldly
pleasures what do you think he means and
what is he talking about and this idea
of jihad and the
Islam Islamic war holy war against India
this is not the idea of
self-determination that someone like you
has talked about in the recent past
messaging is extremely worrisome and how
I look at it is what has happened how it
has come up come about and using
religion as the source of motivation to
do incidents like this when we talk
about radicalization I have been in the
field and see these youngsters you know
doing all these stuff is there anything
in your experience that repairs you for
this absolutely this motivation in this
action I'm saying you know what happens
when conflict lands youngsters into a
state of absolute despair what kind of
support system then religion then faith
then society comes up with so here in
this case radicalization as a
consequence of radicalization as a cause
suicide bombing what should be the kind
of motivations that can lead somebody to
do a suicide involvement
nothing beyond nothing nothing lesser
than religion I think lesser than
possibly imagining that the rewards for
such an act are going to be huge that's
what worries me that something which
started purely for enforcement of
political rights has the potential of
deviating into a territory which is
going to be extremely dangerous not just
focus me not just for rest of the
country for the entire South Asia I'm
saying that what begins what began
rather with a simple agitation with the
simple crisis related to political
rights of people what kind of things
then it can degenerate into that danger
we saw in that speech you're saying this
is a degeneration of what Kashmir E's
have been articulating as their cause it
is absolute the generation because we
cannot afford to frame the argument that
Kashmir is about in religious terms
because it's finally not about Kashmiri
Muslims own
it's about Kashmiri pundits as well
which may be pundits are one of the
fundamental and most important
stakeholders of Ishmael
we have other regions we have German we
have a dark where as which is
predominantly Buddhist so we have other
stake where we have six we have
Christians so fundamentally if you try
to frame Kashmir argument in a religious
kind of picture then it's totally
devastating you said it could be the
cause or the consequence which one would
you SSID radicalization as a consequence
why does the religion come religion
comes from when there is political
vacuum in the place what kind of things
can then fill that vacuum is firstly
it's the religion it's the extremists or
maybe hardcore ideologies which come in
and then substitute for the loss of or
or withdrawal of politics in Kashmir I
can assure you that if political process
gets revived we will see a drastic
change in the way conflict is
represented you're talking about the
political process being revived do you
mean
an elected government because we had one
so because the front of the basic
argument which we now need to reexamine
is that our elections the solution or
our elections the solution in the format
they are conducted our elections and
endorsement of the status quo or our
elections something which we need to
re-examine and risa clue today is that
kind of argument we saw an elected
government was formed in the state it
lasted for three years we had an
overwhelming mandate around 70 to 80
percent voting happening in 2014 and 15
and in 2018 three years down the line by
polls the municipal complete by and
today it's very hard for us to even
conduct elections in the state so in
that context of SL how do you see the
put choice you are making and that is to
use electoral politics and yet I'm
confused about how you're planning to
use it because you do want to use it but
you're saying that the way it has been
used so far hasn't worked what has
happened for years and Rada is that
there is demise of politics in the state
there was an important space which was
occupied by a certain political party I
do not want to name that political party
that party engaged into an electoral
alliance with the politically and
ideologically totally opposite political
party who initially everybody thought
that coming together of these opposite
polarities would possibly have health
Kashmir but there was a widespread
sentiment in the ground which predicted
that this is going to lead to a disaster
because that constituency of people
which associated with that political
party which was more towards the soft
separatist side which talked about the
aspirations we talked about the
resolution of Kashmir issue oh we didn't
have baggage oh the biggest thing was
that it didn't have legacy issues yeah
that politics got descent they know that
got decimated the day that collision
happened
and what happened because of that is
that we had a huge number of people
mostly youngsters who got politically D
anchored he will tell me how they do not
relate to any other political ideology
this political party had occupied a very
unique space in Kashmir this political
kind of scream it but it's the PDP that
you're referring to for my understanding
for me it's about the space so my point
is that that space it was a very very
dangerous experiment that that space was
left abandoned and we got into power
politics just for the sake of power and
chair and we saw three years down the
line we saw three years of crisis and we
saw that crisis escalating to our level
where you have an unprecedented level of
violence happening at the state 2018 was
one of the deadliest years and last one
decade you don't think the other
mainstream party the National Conference
can can do this job effectively can
reach out to the people because you've
talked to them and you have considered
the idea of joining them we you met Omar
Abdullah why is it that you don't see
this party as providing an option every
political party is catering to a section
of public opinion English Peter oh I
believe every political party is
important but when it comes to providing
solutions and catering to a constituency
which does not relate to anybody which
does not relate to anybody because the
first question your legacy issues they
tell you what happened in 1947 what
happened in 1953 what happened in 1983
what happened in 1987
what about 1989 what about 1996 so this
constituency ask questions and then they
know who were responsible for all these
things which have happened in the past
and this constituency doesn't doesn't
doesn't feel like engaging with anybody
so what do we do you that's why I said
we need to reimagine kashmiri politics
how are you going to present a
convincing alternative or how you will
dream
this vacuum as you're calling calling it
might be am I looking at skeptical about
you do you do because it's very hard to
be optimistic at a place like a schmear
where everything seems to be you know
going just bonkers and nothing is
working but for me it's about
maintaining that optimism about
continuously giving hope to people
because what do we do then
do we stay home and die and do all of us
wait for our doomsday that's not going
to happen my belief is that we need to
enlarge the Democratic space in Kashmir
what does that mean yeah what does that
mean what does that mean a lot of
Kashmiri management is about managing
the political spaces what are the
political spaces so we have a space
which has been occupied by people who do
not believe in the Constitution do you
acknowledge that space do you deny it I
acknowledge I say if you want to go for
a solution first thing is that it
acknowledged that there's a space
there's a constituency we doesn't
believe in the constitutional way of
resolution let's talk to them they are
very important stakeholders there's a
space which has been occupied by
traditional parties which in spite of
legacy issues which in spite of having
been in the state for many many years
they're also holding on to a certain
culture right let's realize that they
also have their own opponents but then
also do something for those people who
have a strong faith in the political
aspirations and who do not see elections
as a way of resolution you see it as
governance administration they see
elections one that if at all elections
are to be done then elections should be
a way of getting good governance number
one an election should not be seen as
betrayal of the sacrifices of the people
one hundred thousand people have died in
Kashmir on both sides of the ideological
divide people are saying that if you
tell us that elections mean endorsement
it means moving on it means forgetting
and giving up we are not going to
participate in the elections so my
argument to them is that elections can
be this electoral space can be very
creatively used
for engaging with Indian state when we
go for elections when I want to
participate in the elections what I am
saying is that I will be first
acknowledging the existence of those
political spaces which are kind of the
custodians of the sentiment custodians
of desperations
ok so there are several points you've
made here let me first pick up this one
about engaging with everybody and all
kinds of stakeholders so when you talk
about people who don't believe in the
Indian Constitution you are talking
about the separatist you're talking
about the holy absolutely and you refer
to them as the guardians of the
sentiment of Kashmiri sentiment what
does that mean does that mean that
politically you shall Faisal the
individual believe in us in in their
ideology in their philosophy of a
separate state of Kashmir what is it
that you believe in so I am talking
about a position about a political
position I am saying that separatists
have not been participating in the
electoral process right because they say
that we have done it once mr. Geelani
has for three elections they say that
after 1987 it makes absolutely no sense
yeah participating in an elephant
process which is not fair what do you do
with that argument so people have
experimented they have engaged once they
are not ready to engage anymore so I am
saying that let's respect their position
and what choices do we have do we go out
for a war with them or do we engage with
them do we acknowledge them or do we
denied their existence if we deny their
existence that they are representing the
sentiment look mainstream politicians
have been time and again saying that we
are not representing the sentiment then
who is representing the sentiment who
does the stone peltor who does the
youngster who is on boycott who does he
listen to why don't our MLAs go out in
the field why doesn't our Minister face
crowds in the a in the Kashmir Valley so
I get this what is your position my
position is that there is a constituency
in Kashmir which is not ready to
exchange or swap aspirations for
grievances they are saying that we are
going to suffer under development I know
people who have done PhDs but they are
not taking government jobs you know why
they are saying this is a compromise on
our position with a weak Rashmi
we do not want to engage with the Indian
state in any manner so my point is that
you have to acknowledge existence of
this constituency that there is a
sentiment in Kashmir is that sentiment
for separation where the sentiment for
plebiscite is there sentiment for
autonomy is that the right to
self-determination that's for us to
later on discuss I ask you again what is
your sentiment my sentiment is that wish
me has a history it's a political issue
which is not something which has been
created in my lifetime sure it has been
therefore 1946-1947 a couple of hours
back
you had the premier the prime minister
of a nuclear state talking about the
schmear you have somebody another
nuclear neighbor a giant in our region
he's blocking our efforts to get
somebody notified in the United Nations
who are these people what the hell are
they doing if this is India's internal
matter if this is our domestic issue who
are these people why are these nuclear
powers kind of interfering in our own
matters that's what I am saying that
Kashmir is not a normal state yeah
my position is that Kashmir is north
Haryana it is not Punjab it's not chatty
Cathie's Guard it's not money poor oh
it's a very unique situation which of
which we are in it's a problem which has
been there since 1947 and we need it's a
political issue it's an issue of Rights
we entered into a into an arrangement
with the Union of India in 1947 that
arrangement is in self disputed but I am
saying that are we ready to agree to the
conditions under which those
arrangements were made what happened to
those conditions what happened to those
promises which were made to people today
when I go to Kashmir is ish media is
telling me that do you deny our history
when somebody says that there is no
problem in Kashmir
people ask me come on are you being
honest what happened in last seventy
years you're not saying it in so many
words but what your stance is is is
clear to anybody who's listening
carefully shoving the stances that
Kashmiri and Union of India is in a very
unique relationship that unique
relationship needs to be respected oh if
something has been done today you would
that relationship that needs to be
restored oh and we need to listen to
those voices who do not necessarily
agree to resolution within the
constitutional framework that's my
position I am representing all sets of
opinions which are definitely given that
we are talking after this massive attack
on India's military forces security
forces do you see this conversation
taking into account people who don't
accept the Constitution the separatists
and having engaging with all political
stakeholders as a possibility how I see
is that we need to look at the loss of
life from and this has been such a
devastating tragedy for the country how
many such incidents are we ready to
accept in coming days I told you it's a
crossing of Rubicon from Kashmir Kashmir
is for many youngsters yeah what are the
options with us the options with Indian
state are that it goes for a
full-fledged war can it go for one more
war and three walls have already been
fought we have seen surgical strikes
have have they done anything that's why
when somebody like me talks about those
old cliche ideas about dialogue about
conversations about you know talking to
each other it sounds kind of crazy at
this moment when we are in such a stage
of mourning
but finally these are the conversations
which we which need to be picked up let
me ask you about something you wrote in
journalist nadir as Dan's book a few
years ago okay I'm going to quote a
little bit it was very lucidly written
very emotionally written you were
talking about your father's death your
father who had been killed by
unidentified gunmen you said and I quote
he had religiously followed the survival
manual for bystanders he was anonymous
he had no opinion on anything overtly
political and he was a very ordinary
unambitious family man but for the first
time in my
I realized that in a war there were no
bystanders there was no neutrality is it
fair to say that when you wrote this and
then when you decided to you know to
appear for the IAS and and and you know
get join the is that you took a stand I
took a position oh that this needs to
stop you put your faith in the Indian
state about what has been happening
look my belief is that we need to engage
with the Indian state I am operating in
a space legislature a constitutional law
in order a political space which is
defined by an in Constitution at the
moment what I'm saying is that what else
do I do I have engaged whatever we need
to get we need to get from the Indian
state first so you took a stand
then I took a stand then today in 2000 I
have taken your stand again are you
changing absolutely not that stand
continues as a civil servant the work
which I've been doing it's fundamentally
a work related to developmental issues
hmm but I am saying that I'm enlarging
my argument I am saying that it's a
political crisis in the making oh I've
been working with politicians so far but
the kind of political vacuum which is in
the state at the moment we need to do
something about that right I am joining
electoral politics
I have no disengaged from the system you
talked about hope to begin with
am i abandoning that hope I am NOT I am
using the existing institutions I'm
enlarging my argument I am saying that
I'm going to engage with the existing
institutions I'm going to use the
democratic method for bringing some sort
of political respite to the place what
makes you confident of being successful
and pardon me if I'm sounding so cynical
but what makes you so optimistic
where are the political parties in the
mainstream space have not managed to
move anywhere I am a staunch believer in
the futility of what I know that the war
is not going to solve this issue number
one number second I'm a strong believer
that Democratic space can be utilized
for getting solutions to that place now
you are asking me why existing parties
are faith oh and what kind of new
politics I am I trying to create
so it's basically about compromises what
kind of compromises are we ready to make
what kind of compromise politics are we
ready to run I have come into politics
after giving up something I've not an
accidental politician I have made a
choice of doing politics in a conflict
zone where I know I can be killed
anytime
it's my optimism that my engagement with
the youth my understanding my
communication with the youth which has
been happening for last 10 years that
has given me that hope that we can still
make things work English believe me it
may sound kind of idealistic it may
sound kind of foolishness our whole
point or too much hope we are too much
idealism too much of youth may be in me
but my engagement that the youth for
last 10 years has made me realize that
people want to resolve issues peacefully
with what we are be astonished believers
in dialog fish meetings are not merely
still continue to be the people who used
to be scared of calling a chicken it's
the desperation of the times the
desperation of the circumstances really
which is pushed which media to the
theories themselves are paying with
their blood isn't it whether it was your
father whether it was your job Bukhari
recently be the biggest victim you know
they are the target of who gets killed
terrorists who you have people who did
their PhDs from big universities in the
country and then got killed why are they
getting killed
what kind of loss is that whose loss is
that who are those people who are
mourning in Kashmir what does don't
Kashmiri mothers and daughters and
sisters don't they count who are those
soldiers who lost their lives are we
just going to listen to it and look at
it and continuously you know kind of
look at these statuses add status exam
they just do nothing about them my
belief is that this war has to end we
need to go back to the people start that
conversation again confrontation is not
going to work Kanu conversation is going
to work in December we had such a clone
of the gnk people's conference make his
bid to position himself as an
alternative to the mainstream parties he
made a very interesting point his point
is a Kashmiri doesn't wake up every day
and think about conflict and politics he
thinks about how to
his rosy routine I think I do not agree
with that position clearly not I believe
that in Kashmir the fundamental question
is of survival today there is an
existence of threat in Kashmir
I was doing my job very happily oh there
are people who were posted who appointed
in Police who are doing good jobs who
had good qualifications to get any post
anywhere in the country it doesn't work
that way it's it it's a it's a it's a
crisis it's a political crisis in
Kashmir people are telling me today in
thousands so do not give us development
do not give us jobs please do something
about the safety of life first please do
something about the escalation of
tensions in Kashmir so initially maybe
10 years back 10 years ago I also
believe it and let's give development to
people and Kashmir will be quite believe
me 70 thousand crores we gave last 80
thousand crores
give us another 100 thousand crores
things are still going to be bad unless
we make any political initiative towards
Kashmir ease this is my strong belief
that unless we revive the political
process and restore those conversations
which have been happening we have seen
moments of calm in Kashmir in our
lifetimes we have seen many just yeah
four to five years back yeah it was
still hope in Kashmir why can't we kind
of revive those conversations when you
talk about engaging with the separatists
someone like Yasin Malik has called you
a new agent of daily the BJP has called
you a proxy of the separatists I really
liked it basically it reflects the
neutrality the position which I have
taken where both sides are pushing me
back so both sides believe that I do not
have agency on the on the actions that I
am taking now this is how this is how
things happen in conflict zone this is
what worries me basically that in a
conflict zone you are forced to take
sites you talked about needies excerpt
from her book so this is about taking
that position that you are literally
forced to take position and no position
is a position in itself so even if you
are a bystander you will get so much
pushback from both sides that you create
a position of your own and you become
vulnerable in your own sense let us say
you do contest elections as you seem to
how do you see that roleplay out if you
were to to experience electoral success
you know why my theory my hypothesis
about Kashmir presently is that if we
are this time in a phase of intense
violence it's because we have either
negated the nonviolent means of
expression or discredited them so my
belief is that if those realities about
Kashmir crisis that the youngsters are
facing the problem militarization the
problem of unknown gunmen the problem of
violence against women the problem of
Kashmiri Pandits if we can articulate
these these facts about these hard facts
about Kashmir in a democratic way my
belief is that there will be absolutely
no need for violence Englishman if
suppose there was a dialogue process
which has been going for on the last 70
years if we are ready to respect a
dialogue process not that we send an
interlocutor we send a negotiator he
produces a report we throw that report
on the dustbin if that doesn't happen
believe me the violence can be covered
so we've heard Omar Abdullah and member
one of team make statements we've heard
all you guys on social media you know
cash meetings who have a voice on social
media and in the media mainstream media
make an appeal to the government make an
appeal to state governments to offer
security to Kashmir ease chef as well if
you were to make an appeal that would
really connect with people people who
are not hoodlums people who are not
politicians looking to you know benefit
or profit from this people who are not
thugs if you were to reach out to people
who understand what you would say at an
intellectual level but I also feel
resentment that Kashmir ease want
Indians to open up their hearts and
minds but that love is not reciprocated
at all when they do and Kashmir is tend
to look at India as India and Indians
right how do you talk to these people to
understand why it is important to
safeguard Kashmir ease if I mean if you
have to make that
you're a plan honestly speaking I won't
deny that even in these days of crisis
we have seen tremendous solidarity
coming from the people of India so my
appeal will not be to the officers of
India it will not be to the politicians
of India it will not be through the
hoodlum and and the bully element it
will be to the people of India that if
you really feel like that we need to
reach out to people this is the time
when you can possibly show Kashmir ease
that you belong to us
let's humanize the narrator about
Kashmir in rest of the country there's a
martyr in your family there's a martyr
in your village there's a crisis similar
crisis a similar killing there's a
similar mourning happening in Kashmir
can these people come together can we
stop this violence and this hatred can
soldiers you know stop being forced to
be carrying the cross of the politician
can Kashmir stop being a vote man kind
of issue in rest of the country I mean
these are the issues which are for the
consideration of the people of India I
wish this kind of hatred this kind of
targeted violence against a certain
community this kind of alienation like
people of countries realize that your
enemies are out to basically they want
you to do the same thing and you're
getting played in the hands of your
enemies please don't do this if you had
to give a message to young men like are
there a Mad Dog
what would it be my message to Kashmiri
is is that we don't need to lead lose
hope in the humanity I think it's
finally the humanity the non-violence
the ability to engage with people that's
finally going to help us in solving our
issues we need to reach out to our
people and and we don't have we don't we
can't allow our humanity to be snatched
that's important when you decided
finally to drop you know to quit the is
was it a difficult decision where your
family was concerned and where people of
Kashmir were concerned because you were
the role model and even for India isn't
it
it was very hard to convince maybe my
mother she has experienced violence in
her own life and faced a tragedy so it
was very hard for her to realize that
her son is also going into a space which
is very risky but then it took me a
couple of years to convince my wife my
mother my friends that I need to do this
I need to bring spotlight maybe to the
crisis in Kashmir which is only possible
if I speak out and this is nothing to do
with any personal ambition your absolute
okay with the sacrifices and the
ultimate sacrifice it's going to be yeah
obviously it's like it's a huge struggle
I know it's going to be a huge risk I've
lost my job all the privileges which
which come with that and I'm operating
in a space where this side is saying
that he is your agent and this side is
saying he's your agent so it's going to
be very risky but that's how life is I
think I'm ready for those risks chef
azah you show a lot of good luck you're
standing up to be counted thank you and
that's always it's always difficult it's
always doubts always risky it's always
risky but we wish you luck because it's
only optimism that and hope that you
know the world rests on it and runs on
oxygen but you can go only when we when
you give us a piece of music that's
special to you or that you could play on

industry actually but I don't want to be
insensitive let's move on this is the
thing we have with you guys you know you

post upon wama attack pakistan Prime
Minister Imran Khan finally opened the
bullying opened his mouth I'm a cricket
lover this will happen I apologize in
his televised address he accused New
Delhi for blaming the Paloma attack on
Pakistan without any proof no one has
ever said that from Pakistan nobody ever
coached
he also warned India that his country
would retaliate if India launched
military strikes against Pakistan yeah
that's what happened generally between
countries joining us now is the alleged
12th man I mean spokesperson for the PMO
Pakistan mr. fibrin Khan obviously Imran
himself refused to come and talk to me
because I haven't even played Ranji
Trophy mr. Khan yes how can I help you
yeah well Imran Khan finally spoke out
about the Palama attack but what took
him so long to come out 5-6 days it's an
old habit it's an old habit
Imran Khan will generally not open
proceedings meaning what
well you know he will never come out
first generally he's always preferred to
come 5 or 6 in the middle order if you
look at the history I mean actually I do
remember his big partnership with Javed
Miandad 1992 World Cup yes yes at that
time it was in partnership with Javed
Miandad yes and now this Sammy maybe in
partnership with Masood Azhar it's
different yeah all right I don't know
exactly that's an admission but let's
focus let's focus no I am very focused
they train we focus in fact I can say
this so I have never been I have never
been more focused in my life and where
we're all very angry everybody's angry
we're really angry go ahead why you guys
angry Imran has asked me to ask your
Prime Minister this question and he
wants a straightforward answer I want to
ask our prime minister question what
question has he seen golly boy like this
let me be frank it's a question of
India's duplicity you advertise a film
golly boy both words are from cricketing
jargon now we saw the movie from start
to finish and I can tell you there is
nothing about cricket in this movie now
who is guilty of lying you tell me this
who is guilty of line I can't believe

I just can't oh and one more thing Imran
wants to ask your Prime Minister how
dare you how dare you how dare you he
what everyone says how dare you cover my
portrait at the Cricket Club of India
what are you and not cover the portrait
of Zahir Abbas I mean that's favoritism
this ridiculous question I don't think
the PM was responsible for covering
Imran Khan's portrait and a club in
Mumbai well I have to say I don't
believe you send me some proof send me
some proof
send me some proof that rhetoric once
again speaking of proof Imran Khan is
asking for proof
Jessi Mohammad is already accepted
responsibility for the attack so what
more proof do you need
now this is not the fault of Pakistan
then what is it
Joshy Mohammed is just an educational
institute in Pakistan and if that career
fails you have options through education
and BA engineering law never thought I'd
see this day I never ever thought I mean
really idolized in one County cricketer
I mean where's he gone where is he I'm
Ron Connor of the 1992 World Cup gone

JgHiDo41cN8,How Long Can &quot;Naya Pakistan&quot; Be In Denial ? | Face Off With Zakka Jacob,FaceOff #ZakkaJacob Imran Khan's blatant denial of Pakistan's involvement in the Pulwama incident is rejected by India.,2019-02-20T03:00:02Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JgHiDo41cN8/hqdefault.jpg,"but let's talk about the big story of
the day today it's been five days since
the terror attack in pol Varma in which
40 CRPF germans were dead in these past
5 days it's been established that
Pakistan is complicit in the deadly
attack that happened in Kashmir and
today for the first time in five days
the Pakistani Prime Minister named Ron
Khan reacted to that attack in a highly
edited televised address it lasted all
of six minutes but there were 17 jump
cuts in those six minutes Imran Khan
brazen dydt out and adopted the same old
Pakistani strategy of living in denial
the pakistan-based terror group the
gesture Mohammed has claimed
responsibility but Imran will have none
of it Imran still says India should give
us proof and if the proof is good enough
we will act on that proof Imran Khan
instead has used the bully pulpit of the
office of Prime Minister of Pakistan to
lecture and warn India of retaliation
he's even gone on to the extent of
saying that if India were to attack
Pakistan then Pakistan will not just
think of retaliation but will actually
retaliate never mind what's happened in
the past in the wars in 48 65 71 or 99
so tonight on face off we're asking the
Jash has claimed responsibility the
suicide bomber put out a video before he
killed himself and 40 other CRPF Jevons
he's put out a video saying that he
belongs to the Jayesh the jesh is led by
this man Masood Azhar who's got a whole
empire a whole Palace in bowel poor not
too far away from Islamabad and yet the
Prime Minister of Pakistan says India
needs to give proof so how long can the
so-called Naya Pakistan continue to be
in denial before we get into our debate
let's take you through how India has
responded to Imran Khan's blasts up the
meas put out a statement a couple of
hours ago in which the MEA spokesperson
has said that Pakistan gains nothing in
fact this is Imran Khan's a video that
he put out earlier this afternoon where
he claims that Pakistan gains nothing
from Pulwama
and that Pakistan cannot be used as a
whipping boy every time there's a terror
attack in Kashmir India has rejected
that the MEA has rejected that and said
that the Pakistan Prime Minister has
ignored
claims made by the perpetrators of the
attack and the claiming of
responsibility by the gesture muhammad
imran khan went on to say in that video
that pakistan will cooperate if
actionable intelligence or evidence of
the attack is shared by India with the
Pakistanis India has rejected that by
saying that that's a lame excuse because
look at what has happened in the past
promises of guaranteed action whether it
was in 26/11 whether it was Pathan code
have all simply ended up being futile
Imran Khan went on to say in that video
that if India attacks then Pakistan will
not just think about retaliating but
will actually retaliate
India has rejected that by saying that
Pakistan is the nerve center of
terrorism and there's no way Pakistan
can be lecturing us least of all about
terrorism and finally Imran Khan as this
was his final comment in that six minute
video he blamed India for using Pakistan
to get a boost before the general
elections which are the Declaration of
which is barely a month away
India has rejected that by saying that
India's democracy is a model for the
subcontinent and for the rest of the
world something that Pakistan will never
understand listening to what Imran Khan
said and the various reactions that have
been coming in and then we'll go
straight across to our guests alright so
Pakistan and its prime minister say give
us evidence we will act never mind all
the evidence it's already out in the
public domain and never mind what's
happened to all the previous terror
attacks and all the evidence has been
given it's come to naught let's bring in
our guest tonight
Nullah Nicoli spokesperson of the BJP
other than saying Beaupre is
spokesperson of the Congress party TC
Singh is former secretary in the
Ministry of External Affairs major will
retired her Schmucker defense analyst
and joining us from Islamabad is
ambassador Ali sulwon acquis former
diplomat and he's executive director
with a center for international
strategic studies let me start with you
Nell and Kohli you must have heard what
Imran Khan said today never mind all the
evidence that's in the public domain
never mind
what is what evidence we gave up to
26/11 what evidence we gave after Pathan
code here on Khan says gimme proof and I
will act what should we do
well if anything is to be made out of
the number of jump cuts in the statement
that came out
perhaps the script that he wrote has
been duly edited by his masters
somewhere in Pakistan so all that one
can say is that the Prime Minister
probably was speaking something and it
has been edited out with regards to the
fact that he is spoken about proof there
have been several instances this is an
old tape with an old rock that's been
running forever from Pakistan give us
poop what happened of the proof that was
given in 26/11 what happened with pat
hand coat what's happened with Uri it's
a waste of time as far as it is there
not even a condemnation about the loss
of life of 40 Jevons
that has taken place that itself shows
what is there if he's looking for any
proof he has to not look further than
his own nose he'll see his cabinet
colleagues moving around freely with
those who are designated terrorists so
therefore from that perspective he is
only saying what is expected from him
there's no credibility and I think the
Government of India statement is quite
unequivocally clearly unambiguously
said what it has to say we pointed out
yeah that end of the day Pakistan is the
nerve center of terrorism with respect
to just pull llama alone ambassador
Casey saying here are five pieces of
evidence that are already in the public
domain in Iran Imran Khan so chooses
he can act one the reassure Mohammed has
claimed responsibility for the attack
publicly - there's a video of the bomber
addled are talking about the gesture
Muhammad and his Pakistani handlers
there is the audio of Masood Azhar
asking carders to avenge the death of
his nephew strewn abused overkill last
year and come round the mastermind who
was killed yesterday again in bull mama
was a Pakistani national what is what is
Imran Khan trying to prove by putting
out that video because the last prime
minister who said give me proof and I
will act was no assurance and we all
know very well what happened to it
no absolutely correct there's enough
proof here and if you remember after
26/11 lost faith I ever never never
claimed that they had done it in this
case this the
we acclaim so they should straight away
at least look within their own house
catch hold of the brothers even a Masood
Azhar's in a hospital as it is reported
and his brother and so on so forth are
the ones who are ready acting they
should all be picked up and interrogated
and then he should turn around and say
we've spoken lols guys we've
interrogated them and they for whatever
reason let them tell us why they say
they are not responsible then who who is
which is the joshi mohammed about whom
the credit has been claimed by whom I
mean that is something for Pakistan to
answer it is not my idea to provide
proof no our and secondly you know the
it's very interesting yeah we'll come to
that later but it's very interesting
today the Pakistani ambassador in Kabul
is now saying that you know if India
takes some action
I can affect these forces in Afghanistan
has no degree of nervousness which is
now creeping in okay degree of
nervousness creeping in okay let me let
me get let me show you see if we can go
across to ambassador Ali started a
massive the Casey Singh sir just said it
was not clear about Afghanistan
ambassador in Afghanistan has given a
comment but but let me get let me get
ambassador Ali server knock we from from
Islamabad master amazed enough we can
you hear me first of all all right I
don't think he can hear me so let's try
and fix his audio and I'll go back to
him can you hear me a bastard up we I'm
gonna try one more time ambassador Ali
server knock we can you hear me I can
hear you now
alright my question to you is your Prime
Minister put out a six-minute video
today which had 17 jump cuts in which he
says give me proof and I will act
there's already the gesture Mohamed
claiming responsibility for the Palama
attack there is the video of the bomber
saying that he was from the Jaya
Mohammed there is Masood Azhar's audio
yeah
my question is not is not writing please
let me finish my question our table
panting please
who are you to decide if it's authentic
or not it's a it's a matter of public
record and who is a matter of power you
can say if your Prime Minister says give
me more I will attack then if your Prime
Minister says give me private monies

it was it was bad it was banned in 2002

the hijacking was a raw operation it was
a highlight was not a raw hijacked its
own delight its own Indian Airlines

calls what I was hosted for free to your
country Wow I mean I've heard of
conspiracy theories what this who had
why did I release it because the light
would have tried it being for every day
is do you understand that I understand
this is this their position should have
been taken general and he cannot be
released ambassador server I I don't
what I don't know what he's come to the
show smoking up I don't know what is
Helen I was ambassador in UAE yeah Casey
Singh was ambassador opinions I was
ambassador to UAE yeah
when the hijacked plane came through by
yes the two by ruling fan family
including the crown prince now yeah of
whom and Rankin is very fond of the
Crown Prince was in the control room
negotiating with the terrorists who
hijacked the plane they let the women
and the children go through one body out
and then took off in the plane even when
the why authorities were trying to stop
them it was a raw operation why were
these people trying why was i standing
there in the middle of the night trying
to get the plane stopped in the mine you
know ambassador server you can go on
with this broken record of your
conspiracy theories and you know you're
you're you know daylight lies but I'm
not gonna have any of it let me cross
the general hush Gartner one second you
are do a general hush I have a simple
question I have a simple question I want
to know why is it that the Pakistani
Prime Minister after five days after the
pole bomber
attack comes out and puts out a video in
which not once does he either condemn
what happened in pool mama nor does he
condone the debts of these these forty
crpf Jevons not once in that six-minute
video and then he has the bluster to say
that in India were to attack then
Pakistan will not just think about
retaliating but will retaliate knowing
full well what happened in 48 what
happened in 65 what happened in 71 what
happened in 99 what is he trying to say
through that video your general it's
very clear to all of us that the video
has been given and he's been given a
script to read yeah and even while
reading the script he made mistakes
which is what led to 16 or 17 cuts yeah
now on top of it the reason why he had
to come out with the video now is the
fear that something will happen
something which may impact the park
military which controls him which will
impact
the feeling that the park nation has for
the military therefore when you are
scared you issue threats when you are
confident you don't threaten India has
warned Park is now threatening out of
fear that if you hit us we will hit back
it is as simple as that
well that is a fear that something is
gonna happen and now at the moment what
if they does they've pulled the
terrorist camps back they have put them
into their own into their own post why
they're scared that if this happens that
means they actually know it happened the
last time which they've continued
denying till now which is again proof
that everyone is aware what happened in
surgical strikes except Pakistan and the
Ambassador will again screen and say let
me what the moment is right by pulling
bags I think it's important for our
viewers to understand what is it that
Imran Khan is trying to achieve with all
this luster in that super video in what
you have 17 jump cuts not what do you
write a chart is essentially this action
to try and get anticipate everybody some
action is going to happen we don't know
in what form or shape that action will
eventually take course but some action
already know he can fail it will it will
make the hottest an army look bad so
Imran Khan is basically taking and
dissymmetry bail for the generals in
Rawalpindi who control him is that right
general occurred that's what has happen
acted no did absolutely right that is
incorrect is not controlled by the
generals well why are there 17 jump cut
so minute video surely he's a better
speaker than that
oh and that is your word for it I don't
know the video has 17 guards oh I I wish
I had it up because you know he hurt the
entire six minutes and count for you
have you ever seen it but because we
have finite amount of time on this
debate let me go across to our elbow
prime I will go pro here here are the
things that have happened and general
Cocker is right they have pushed back
the temporary camps away from the LOC
for the deep inside behind
army posts anticipating that there might
be some kind of a surgical strike kind
of operation number one number two we
know that Masuda horrible machine it's
going to me it's going to be X once
again it's going to be extremely
difficult operation if at all it happens
to try and take him out from a highly
guarded military hospital in Rawalpindi
we know that his brother Ralph Oscar is
running the show in Bob Walpole which
again is as fortified as any kind of
garrison establishment my question to
you is simple what does India need to do
now because Imran Khan has come out and
issued a lot of bluster and general
Kocher has has explained that
beautifully to our viewers what is it
that he's trying to achieve what is it
that India needs to do right now well
raka the fact of the matter is that
today our country's yearning for justice
and this has been a consistent strategy
of the Pakistani state to mislead the
international community
Imran Khan is asking who is Masood Azhar
Masood as there is an individual who is
travelling on a Portuguese passport was
arrested in Jammu and Kashmir was freed
consequent to a hijack operation in
Kandahar in Afghanistan which he should
have never been he should have never
been freed and perhaps Ajit Doval should
tell us why he was freed but the fact of
the matter today is continuous reform
and terror they continue to foment
terror they continue to encourage
terrorist activity in Jammu and Kashmir
and today the country has to respond the
Pakistan deep state must be given as
mean I think our military generals have
the entire wherewithal they are the
experts they have all options on the
table and they will give a befitting
response no but having said this Sokka I
think we also need to strengthen our
security architecture do you expect the
Pakistani establishment to change track
is asking for too much we have to
strengthen the loopholes we have to plug
the gaps we have to rectify mistakes the
paramilitary forces said that these
officers these jurors should be
airlifted why when they Nora lifted the
night Patong quote in the positive
equity in the passive and agro Thai in
the past we had the camera not theater
attack in the power why are we not
learning we should not
you pop establishment to change a tizzy
what we have we also must ability
government the serious questions need to
be asked about some of the lapses the
German Kashmiri governor is on record
that there was a there was a failure
there were Intel inputs but but that's
another debate and I don't want to get
that again into that debate tonight
tonight I want to keep the focus on what
is it what is it no once again what is
Imran Khan done and how should India
respond okay
null in Kohli and now I want to take a
step back in and look at the larger
picture here one second what may or may
not happen in the next few days I do not
want to anticipate the Prime Minister no
less has said that full freedom has been
given to the army they will decide the
time and place of what the response
should be and be that as it may what I
want to ask you now on Kohli is the
larger policy response
ever since Pakistan was defeated fair
and square
in 1971 and the country was divided into
two there's Bangladesh and then there is
Pakistan they try 20 years and finally
came up during the general zia years of
course post the Mujahideen in
Afghanistan there came up with this
asymmetric warfare in Kashmir the truth
of the matter is nilin through NDA and
UPA we have not found a policy response
to this asymmetric warfare we have had
episodic responses but not a policy
response what may that policy response
be of the congress spokesperson because
my focus is on Pakistan today yeah will
you uh Qaeda cut down because you know I
don't agree with the word in fact you
know Pakistan is beyond the theater of
absurd it's an absolute lunatic place
when will the kind of theories that we
maybe because they live in conspiracies
and Dyne conspiracies they see a
conspiracy in everything we need to be
more bothered about our concerns and
certainly not a Pakistan we really don't
care about it there they are entitled to
live in their worldview no matter how
absurd it is so let's come and the fact
of the matter is no
say man on the face of the earth barring
a terrorist would never pick up and say
let me take a visa and go and visit
Pakistan for holiday you don't go to
commit suicide there are better ways of
doing it
so let's come back to your serious
question your question is about a policy
this right here the first one has been
established over the last several years
that terror and talks don't go they have
been chance done have been you look IRA
him you can just put this down oh I
disagree with every word that he says so
thank you thank you thank you so the
point I was making is the first is look
irrespective of the political color of a
government whether it is Congress BJP or
a coalition government peace is always
to be given a chance but then you draw
your lines and that line finally under
Prime Minister Modi eventually in his
comment not at the starting piece was
given a chance it has been terror and
talks don't go now wide enterin talks
don't go because that's part of the
Lahore declaration where Pakistan
unequivocally unambiguously made its
commitment that they will not allow
their soil to be used for terrorists
they haven't kept to their promise the
problem is that Pakistan and India have
signed a number of statements released
statements agreements whatever they
never adhered to their part India as a
responsible member of the global
committee has chosen to honor its
commitments now that we are here where
Tehran and talks don't go the second I
think line which has been made clear is
that certain red lines if they are cross
we are willing to be proactive in our
defence the surgical strikes is an
example of that that the government has
clearly said so the opposition is
speaking in a similar voice that there
has to be some kind of response to what
has happened we of course can't comment
on that we don't know and I would hope
we don't know because that is the realm
of those who are in charge of this
whereas the political leadership or more
importantly the Armed Forces or the
security forces whose domain it really
comes in to the diplomatic of a
committee of us who are working on their
own way so I think we leave to the
specifics of a response but that there
has to be a response I think it goes
without saying India's patience India
has been probably
immensely patient with Pakistan but I
think that patience with this is
tipping point as wrong what has happened
in Palama may well turn out to be a
tipping point because this is then is
yes because what's happened is it's
audacious it's a new technique it's
absolutely blunt it is done openly and
therefore there is a point which you
know like in the other day and expert on
another TV show
corded a tipping point by saying that
while instances of rape would happen
Naevia was a tipping point so this is a
kind in terrorism a tipping point and I
was a good thing about it is that across
India across the political spectrum
across region across society there is a
general mindset a great sense of grief
and anger that enough is enough and I
think that kind of unity that we are
seeing but I want to get Casey Singh's
view on this they come these moments
where it touches our honor and Pulwama
definitely touched her honor whether you
are watching those pictures sitting in
Chennai or in or in go hottie or in or
in Gandhinagar it touched a raw nerve
something about those pictures the scale
the audacity of that attack has led a
large majority in this country to turn
around and say enough is enough we need
to do something now the question is
Casey Singh today we had the Iranian
presidential spokesperson come out and
confirm that the person who attacked
those Revolutionary Guards I think 27 of
them were dead again an attack that
happened very close to when poleramma
happened was a Pakistani national I want
to know from you sir you have these two
big countries on either side of Pakistan
you got Iran on its waist you got India
on its East I mean we talked about two
front wall how come the Pakistanis I
never worried about a two front they get
decimated they'll get overrun if there's
a two front war this was deliberately
done and this was before the crown
prince of Saudi Arabia arrived in
Pakistan they were lined with Saudi
Arabia and Emirates in the larger battle
which is going on Americans and the
Israelis on the same side against Iran
Qatar and perhaps Turkey know first
comes the hit against Allah has not lost
the Saudis
barring any salt there's no conspiracy
and what does what the Iranians have
done is and that is you have three kinds
of response you have a diplomatic
response you have a military response
you have a sub conventional response the
Iranians within three four days or five
days of that have already killed six
seven Pakistani soldiers through
intermediaries now we haven't done that
because that's not something that
governments talk about but that is
really a missing link here that it can't
be all the time just army and military
attacks or diplomacy we've been talking
of this but but then see what the
Iranians have done and Iranians will
continue to do it but Pakistan has taken
a stand they have aligned with Saudi
Arabia and that is what brings me to the
visitor who's arrived this evening which
is crown prince of Saudi Arabia the
statement in Pakistan doesn't give you
much hope he's aligned completely with
them and now the sense I get is he wants
to mediate we are not looking for
mediation yeah we were looking for Saudi
Arabia to align with us against Pakistan
and I hope p.m. I believe p.m. is again
going to the airport I was opposed to it
I think we need to really deal with the
Saudis with a degree of directness and
forthrightness there is no need to you
know bend over backwards and accommodate
them
he's a crown prince looking for
legitimacy he's got a murder charge on
his area US Congress is after him now if
he is looking for legitimacy what does
he put on the table as far as India is
concerned and that is to align with us
against Pakistan not to line their
pockets and play the role of a mediator
yeah I just want to say that before I
get general Coco's views in because he
wanted to make a comment within the hour
I think about 8:45 within the next few
minutes in fact Prime Minister is
expected to go to the palem Airport and
receive Mohammed bin Salman who's the
Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia his visit
was supposed to be juxtaposed first to
Pakistan then to India but subsequent to
the Palama attack a large number of his
people in the delegation apparently
pulled out so he had to go back to Saudi
Arabia and he's coming now
the visit officially begins from
tomorrow but tonight within the next 15
minutes or so the Prime Minister is
expected to go to Parliament receive
mb/s as he's known Normand bin Salman
but January
to make a point uh what I'm trying to
get at and I'm trying to have a senior
position as possible we I'm convinced
that the response to an asymmetric
warfare has to be asymmetric it cannot
be what we've tried over the last thirty
years
okay okay now first let me put it in the
lighter vein though of course the Prime
Minister is going to receive him but
he's the Indian Prime Minister not Imran
Khan who will drive him like a chauffeur
so that's going to be this that's going
to be the difference secondly when you
look at the policies between india and
park a park policy towards Kashmir
Indian policy towards Pakistan the
reason why we are in this state in
Kashmir is for the last about 30 years
Park is followed a steady policy because
we learn by the army no government could
intervene
nevah straight to change it and Nawaz
was out and we know where he is now now
in India's case every government that
comes in starts with its own concept
either you begin talking about talks
first and then isolation and then you
talk about no talks or some government
says we won't play cricket so you know
the haphazard nacinda policies we've
never really been able to get Pakistan a
cornered into a position that it can it
is forced to give up yeah so we've been
having a haphazard system and they've
been having a very steady policy which
no leader no government has been able to
touch this has been a disadvantage now
if we are to go and get back to change
if not now over this period of time of a
few years then we need to have a
cohesive policy employing all our
elements of power whether they be
talking of military it's one which we
talked about today
you've got your diplomatic power you've
got your economic path unless we decide
to go cohesive we will again be running
into it you had a strike okay I mean do
something or the of the armed forces do
something the diplomacy does something
the economy pulls backs it doesn't work
yeah no I think general Kaku is right
other and I think for this I'm taking a
completely non-political non partisan
view on
whether it is Congress or BJP factors we
we have not had a consistent policy when
it comes to dealing with Pakistan it is
range from talks to no talks to engaging
with them to not engaging with no
cricket yeah to do not playing cricket
as though that would help solve all our
problems I mean we need to have a
consistent policy in the case of
Pakistan at least you can give them this
much that every time there seems to be
an incremental progress in the
relationship the army will do something
to pull it back they've been consistent
in in that you can't find fault with
that Chaka Chaka you have to understand
the fundamental feature of Pakistan it
is an army with a state it is not a
state with the army this is the
fundamental trait of Pakistan but you
know let me be very clear on this today
the country stands United as far as a
befitting response to the Pakistani
establishment is concerned but over the
past five years and I'm not intending
intending to politicize it over the past
five years there has been a policy
paralysis when it comes to diplomacy and
security calculus visibly Pakistan you
know often it's said that we've isolated
Pakistan I don't think that's true in
fact that's furthest from the truth
the Americans today need Pakistan for
Taliban the Saudi the plates with twenty
billion dollars the Chinese are their
all-weather Ally the Russians are
cozying up to Pakistan so therefore we
need to come out of this echo chamber
and acknowledge that Pakistan is not
isolated we need to isolate them this is
point number one point number two I
think we have to strengthen our security
architecture let the generals let our
army do their job
Pakistan terror launch pads have to be
struck they have to be sent a very
strong message the costs have to be
inflicted the cost the temperature has
to be increased so that they understand
that they can't get away with this more
close to fifty of our soldiers have lost
their lives their sacrifices cannot go
in win yeah I think the country today
demands justice it is not about
retribution
it is about justice learn I think the
correct term is justice Nurlan families
deserve just another hope takes allah
platitudes yeah the country needs when
you say when you say pakistan is getting
isolated other less a point I mean the
Saudis
just pledged twenty billion dollars the
Americans need them to bring the Taliban
on to the table
the Chinese have not given any
indication of changing their position on
Masood Azhar in fact they're pouring
billions into Chinese projects in
Pakistan so where is this isolation
happen so hundreds not it well I mean it
India's had its fair share of positives
I won't call them successes because in
diplomacy it's a continual exercise so
you have your successes in terms of
positives and then you have your
setbacks one important coin that I think
came out and again I'm talking in a
non-partisan manner I'm keeping myself
on that is that general subset a very
interesting thing when he made that
observation with regard to the
consistency in Pakistan in terms of a
military establishment hurry which is
also a security establishment as the ISI
having a consistency towards an anti
India approach and particularly Jammu
and Kashmir and where we are a democracy
and therefore he was seeing it as a
limitation of course democracies are
strained because Pakistan is a failed
state when it comes to democracy they
don't know what democracy is they
probably never will but the larger point
here to be made is that maybe there is
some merit to be seen in that and we
probably approach them with our ideals
of democracy and peace and others
whereas they approach us possibly as
clearly an enemy state they may say
anything but they do treat us as an
enemy state because we are at the
receiving end of terror strikes and
consistently over the last 2025 years so
maybe yeah I don't know what the
government will do I will not speak for
the government I will not speak for army
because they are the experts to decide
what they may I do but as I said it's a
tipping point in full wama and one thing
I'm certain about is that the public
mood is uniform across the country you
don't have to be anywhere or check it's
not on partisan political lines or any
lines it's a clear line of India and
India's interests and I think that's a
moment let's hope and see what the
client does I want to go
server from from from Islamabad and I'm
hoping to have a reasonable conversation
with you ambassador why would a prime
minister of any country it's bad enough
that he's taken five days to even put
out a tweet condemning what happened in
Kashmir
ah he's put out a video today's
six-minute long video where not even
once has he condemned the attack or
condoled the victims of the attack III
go back to what happened at the Army
Public School in Peshawar know once
again let me finish my question I go
back to the attack that happened in 2015
at the Army Public School and the Army
Public School in Peshawar one of the
first world leaders to condemn what
happened in Peshawar was Prime Minister
Modi the next day the Indian father and
observed a minute's silence so the
Indian Parliament listen observe the
minute's silence by the foreigner and
your prime minister does not even have
the courtesy of condemning what happened
or condolence what the families are
going through again and again he is
talking about this specific problem and
he has told you that if we are
threatened they will retaliate know what
that is all he has done once again was
was what happened in Pulwama terrorist
attack or not yes I imagine because it
was in you know you don't need to
imagine that in the imagination you
asked it was what the residence inside
what whatever it is I visit a PS my
friend you must organize so what
happened in the 80s so what happened at
the ApS school in Peshawar was that a
terrorist attack or not we M yes we have
taken a strong action we go back in say
hundred and how house Government of
India cooks and the people of India and
the parliamentarians of India responded
to that attack there were candlelight
vigils in schools across this country
when ApS attack happened the
parliamentarians of India observed a
million islands in the next day after
the APS attack happened Prime Minister
Modi yes folk on the phone with Nawaz
Sharif he was in fact one of the first
leaders in the world to speak to Nawaz
Sharif controlling
what happened there I'm asking you yes
so I would your if my Norden attend such
a basic courtesy versus he can't be
condemning again and again oh okay
as though the [ __ ] as though as though
every terror attack is the same and one
condemnation is good enough right well
III said the Foreign Office's first men
had condemned it
no mama Faisal is not the prime minister
of your country last time I checked no
no Kanan can I please ask you your your
prime minister says give us the proof
and we will act I've not only listed
what whatever proof yeah they're in the
public domain leave that aside why is
what we said and what about the roof
well is what we said even he 26 leave
what about the proof that was given
after 26/11 is what I have a little way
intend we want what about the proof that
we gave out uncle only solution is that
not good enough the only solution is to
have joint investigation okay so so a
team from your country can hear what
happened to that you cannot you know
what happened to us we are your theories
you know what happened to the joint
investigation of money up your mind
about what happened to the you condemn
Pakistan right away not a residue
treatise has affected you says joint
investigation right you said joint
investigation there was a JIT that came
from your country went and visited there
on coat airbase
what came of that investigation sir yes
what happened yeah you tell me there was
no cooperation the Indian there was no
cooperation from the Indian team you
believe that a Pakistani team having ISI
and military intelligence officials will
be let into a forward air base in India
without cooperation from the Indian side
really well yo you you you you your
people are front drawn from various
agencies your stuttering forwards and
that's
but general Canadian closing comments
from my guess I am convinced that
there's no there's no depending on the
Pakistanis there's no depending on the
Americans or the Saudis or the Chinese
for this this is our problem and we need
to find a way to deal with it we have
been we have been scrambling for an
effective policy response for the last
30 years hopefully that will change
after poll gamma if anything good can
come out of it it is that we would have
found some kind of a response and I'm
not naive enough to suggest that there
is some kind of a silver bullet general
cop car and Casey sing to close out the
dacha if I yeah I want to just give a
suggestion that now is the time use the
National Security Council you have
created something excellent which you
claim to be under under the NSA and
you've got I don't know whom all into it
work out a correct policy to deal with
bark give the policy on the table to all
parties let this be the national policy
of India to try and contain Park over
the next few years all right Casey
saying final word 30 seconds I'm rapping
about that I think the the problem is I
don't buy this argument that has been
left to the military such operations are
never left to the military even watched
I had very clear guidelines during
Kargil you can't cross L you see details
are left to the military are you going
to hit just the terrorist hideouts are
you going to hit Pakistani army are you
going to do it in one place or the other
then the army is allowed so that's a
decision the government has to take
government's problem is that because
surgical strike has then gone into a
Bollywood film and then it's been given
so much publicity the public now wants
surgical surgical strike plus no where
does that plus take you that is a call
the government has to make the elections
coming up public mood is aroused where
is that plus and what is that Plus which
will then create a response or not
create a response so I think it's a very
complicated thing but it'll be a
political choice that is not a military
choice okay all right I'm going to thank
all my guests I'm gonna say this much
that at the end of the day yes your mood
in the country is
not for revenge or retribution and I
agree with our bill on that it's for
justice you cannot attack and kill 40 of
our jo-ann's
and think that there will be no
consequences to it it is absolutely
about justice and the response need not
be spectacular but the response has to
be effective and the response needs to
be delivered in a way that the adversary
knows that there is a cost to pay the
next time you try and act funny with
India there is a cost to pay and a very
heavy one of that and there will be a
response believe you me sooner than
later and we'll all be witness to that
response

good evening Namaskar da da it's not
been even a week less than seven days
since we lost 40 of our brave CRPF
Germans in pivara today the whole day
we've been giving you details of how in
another encounter which was taking place
around the same area where terrorists
were being flashed out officers from the
ranks of di G in Jammu and Kashmir
Police - a left-hand cover and Colonel
and a brigade here in the Indian Army
they were getting hit by bullets which
were being exchanged and while all this
action was unfolding what were our
politicians our natha's doing they
simply have told us that they have lost
all patience the political class in
India is unwilling to wait anymore the
political class in India believes that
if ever there was a moment somehow to
send this message to the people of India
that this is the issue on which you must
vote and you must choose me because
guess what I am the right person I am
the right party to deal with this
situation
please vote for me they don't want to
keep calm politicians want to keep
looking for opportunities to do some
more chest-thumping Mamta banerjee who
till yesterday was busy wearing a black
band was moving around the streets of
Kolkata all her colleagues were moving
around and today the same month I
Banerjee does not want to waste any time
then simply leveling accusations against
the Barda janta party this time for
politics I sometimes wonder whether a
politicians really know that there has
to be a time for scoring political
points and there has to be a time some
time just to think about India's
interest if this if this is not
political hypocrisy then I don't know
what is just look at these these two
different frames on one anywhere without
accolade who by the way boss of the
ships and I was using the Paloma attacks
till 24 to 48 hours back to hit out
against the BJP and asking them
questions as to what is it that the BJP
will do why is it that the BJP could not
control the Palama attacks and today the
same with our Factory is sitting on the
same stage with the BJP having worked
out on a line so
his party with the BJP in the state of
Maharashtra from Punjab to utter Pradesh
to West Bengal I'm only seeing nathas
going out of their way to take
straightforward political positions on
poleramma without actually being
bothered about what is happening on the
ground this month of energy versus Amit
Shah war is leading us to I think the
most unfortunate episode which is
playing out right before us but if you
thought that this is the first time
that's happening take a look at this
graphic folks let me embarrass our
political class a little more and let me
shock you all a little more because what
I am doing tonight is just bringing you
up front with the the hidden reality the
dirty reality of India's politics just
take a look at what was happening in
1999 2001 when the Kargil war was
happening
what did Sonia Gandhi do the then
president the Congress party weakness
and instability of the BJP government
lies exposed in 1999 thundered Sonia
Gandhi when she wanted to score points
against a party at the party she was not
thinking in terms of weighting or
anything Networks Inc
Congress colleagues of Sonia Gandhi What
did he say now out of course she lugar
panty men could do mud matching here
that was what not forcing fight about
the barrage in the party when 26/11
Mumbai terror strikes happened narrator
Modi who was then the Chief Minister of
Gujarat now the Prime Minister instead
of attacking Pakistan you PM monthly
goes to the United States for help what
kind of a government is this LK Advani
the man who in 2009 was the prime
ministerial candidate for the BJP UPA is
guilty of practicing vote bank politics
and therefore is guilty of weakening the
fight against terror it goes on and on
and on when soldiers were beheaded along
the line of control in 2013 again
the Chief Minister of Gujarat by then
the man who was said to be taking over
India ups would bank politics has made
India unsafe his colleague Sushma Swaraj
who's now foreign minister what did she
say her circuit badly dust her like a
hungry that
is what was being said by sushma swaraj
then now I ask you to divorce what
should we be focusing on should we be
focusing on where was the lapse why was
pull-pull wama allowed to happen or
should we be focusing in
hyperventilating about just how great
the political class in this country is
and every political party in this
country has answers to questions which
by the way no one wants to talk about so
let me be direct about this and I have a
deep sense of embarrassment frankly in
stating this clearly that I believe
political class in India just doesn't
care about issues all it cares about is
how to get the next vote politics in
India is only and only about getting
your vote by hook or by crook create
some kind of an emotional sense move you
away from a factual debate and bring you
on to a pitch which is purely based on
rhetoric purely based on emotion my fear
now is that on the road to 2019 the
biggest talking point could very well be
what has happened in poll wama could
very well be the aftermath of Palama I
don't think that the biggest talking
point the biggest political x-factor on
the road to 2019 henceforth is going to
be an earnest assessment of what has
been achieved by the BJP government it's
not going to be fought on economics it's
purely now going to be fought on what
brings greater emotion to the table what
increases the level of rhetoric that's
where I stand let's raise a big-gun
question of the short ride and welcome
all our panelists on the show politics
is over Paloma is this political war
that we are now seeing unfold before us
is this political war simply put going
to ensure a loss in this war on terror
is a electoral victory is that electoral
victory equal to a loss of actually
identifying and dealing with the real
causes of terror in this country full
political panel and a great lineup of
top army officers is here with us
tonight Colonel VN topper one of the
most talked-about and as I keep
reminding every time he comes to the
studio always a great pleasure to hear
him and see him father of Skagen
Matra brief capital vigil popper he's
live with us tonight general rameshwar
oil defense analyst is live with us
today
Zafar Aslam spokesperson of the BJP
professor manoj it model representing
the Trinamool Congress a left region in
Shankar Prasad representing the Indian
Army estuary Mahadev is from the
Congress party as well warm welcome to
all of you I just want to begin with you
can you top at first and I just want you
to take a good look at a graphic that
we've prepared frankly when I looked at
this graphic which shocked me it shocked
me because it told me just how
completely devoid of emotion is our
political class really this is a graphic
which basically tells you how natives
were busy tweeting away on the very day
as details of what was unfolding with
poleramma
as that was coming out as that was
coming up so she'll commercial day
Congress leader former Home Minister at
5:45 p.m. what does he say when the time
of attack 3:15 so look at that the time
of attack is 315 people are still trying
to understand what has happened
immediately Sushil Kumar Singh the jump
in Modi government brags about surgical
strikes
it's Modi government that has led to
pull wama strikes then emit shot the BJP
president at 6:29 p.m. our forces will
remain firm against terror and defeat
them
Akhilesh Yadav former yupi Chief
Minister boss of the Samajwadi Party BJP
should shift focus from elections to
national security details are coming out
we are still being told what is
happening and natha's are already
briefed Prime Minister Modi thunderous
roars he says sacrifice of Braves won't
go in vain the lips in Surjewala
five years as rahul gandhi was busy
taking this position and that's where
the hypocrisy comes from the political
class all gandhi goes on camera gives a
statement says the country must be
united and what does this chief
spokesperson do national security
compromise where is a 56 inch chest now
quite a topper please tell me if I look
at all these statements self is this
what you expect from the political class
in times of need when an incident when
an episode like this is being out right
before us far from it when far from it
we require the total support
of each and every party each and every
Institute and each and every Indian I
just want to say a small thing that you
expect the army to do miracles you want
the trifle man to do something great for
the country but that's all these party
people were making noises like this
do they ever realize what makes him do
all that it is the fact that he knows
the whole nation is behind him and you
know they're there they're very
appreciative of his the job that he's
doing but the moment you start changing
your blood group from something to four
mongrels from from BJP you start
thinking you have a party or they start
thinking Polly you know you have started
you put your party politics above the
national Margit bundle just look at what
is being said here by Kenneth Oppel
can you explain to me yes what exactly
mano g yes is the thought process of
West Bengal Chief Minister today is she
suggesting that this entire this entire
unfortunate episode which is played out
was staged managed by the BJP that forty
soldiers of the CRPF have died because
of BJP wonder why do happen miss mr. cha
may mr. Cho be you you probably
misunderstood - what mock the ban as you
were saying in vernacular she was not
talking about the attack being straight
managed by the BJP and she was talking
about certain incidents which are
happening in Bengal on the basis of
these attacks in in in a Kashmir there
are definitely certain incidents which
are communal in nature which are
happening in Bengal there are three
incident that she was referring to that
this those incidents are stage-managed
but she was definitely not you know
talking about the terror incidents there
just only asking few questions and with
which we have been all asked including
you what what what what what yes
question what is responsible no question
no enquiry needed but no inquiry needed
but but was there an intelligence
failure was not there an introduced
failure there must be some inquiry
Pakistan is responsible no inquiries
needed we know that this is sponsored by
Pakistani the mastermind list
this is what I'm talking that's why
that's exactly what you're we we are
focusing on that you have to synergize
now there is a time to love and there is
a time to fight and we are fighting a
war now let not be an open war but it's
a war of different kind and here we look
at what parochial just look at useless
kind of just look at what bumpa banerjee
says she says i have doubts on why this
happened right before elections and why
no action was taken against Pakistan in
the last 5 years now
why no action was taken in the law
against Pakistan the last five years I
mean maybe month a disease forgetting
that in 2017 there were surgical strikes
which are carried out monolith Mandell
so when month adi starts talking in this
language is she also not guilty of
politicking the exact allegation is you
are against the BJP look exactly that
mr. Chaubey this this kind of no no no
no no no no these kind of actions have
been taken taken by all the government's
on the borders and our jo-ann's are
fighting let's not talk about that but i
mean i'm asking very simple question the
people who are instigating few of our
customary friends why they were
protected with the 500 rupees 500 rupees
look at the kind of magic 101 aduba
moment them to keep quiet for a moment
Jana Prasad just look at the sentiment
being expressed there by the political
class I'm on a very very straight
forward and direct question tonight that
is a political class guilty no political
class mind you I'm not saying a
political party is the political class
guilty of compromising the war on terror
is that what's happening to represent
yes you are absolutely correct you see
the national security and the armed
forces seems to become the most
important aspect in politics you do a
surgical strike
they say kunikida de la Li okay and you
make political mileage out of various
issue that the military does so it seems
like it's fashionable it's very
profitable it is good for the people to
talk about bring national security and
the Armed Forces because it raises
passions and to say this is the right
time to do it or not the right time to
do it somebody's done it for election
somebody's not done it for election it
seems like a very fashionable thing a
very profitable thing to BRE use the
Armed Forces in the national security
aspect in all of it now my point no pain
is that you can talk about elections on
many platforms development
farmers lower health issues money
unemployment student education millions
of things you can fight elections on for
God's sake why do you have to fight
elections only on national security
today the nation is mourning the death
of 40 crpf personnel one major yesterday
one major today four other ranks today
one Brigadier wounded one dij wounded it
seems another Colonel wounded is just
the time to talk politics have it don't
be Sol so ridiculous if I may use the
word for absolutely no no please please
that's what we lose elections yeah on
the blood of the people that's Assad is
just going on ridiculousness
that's what is going on I'm going to
fight election on the blood of the armed
forces what is going on elections
actually what is going on I've just put
this graphic up run deep Singh Surjewala
on the day when this attack was
happening and when details were still
coming out we didn't know the country
didn't know the exact the exact extent
of what had happened mr. Surjewala was
busy telling the country what had been
said by 56-inch chest is that what we
expect for the political class - very
edgy you know I'd like to make one
simple example when a government shares
in the glory of a surgical strike
politicizes in and also makes a movie
and has everybody shouting how's the
Josh the very simple fact is when there
is a failure when they are is martyrdom
for so many of our Jevons I think the
government inherently has to look in and
see if there's a fault and let me ask
you this we stand united with the BJP
yes yes yes please complete I've only
one word to describe your argument today
that's hypocrisy aishwarya top pleat
total hypocrisy of what is being
suggested by you very simple fact
remains judgment on me let me complete
yes the very simple fact remains that
there are millions of people on the
streets today asking the same questions
that if you're seeing your Pakistan
policy and your policy in Jammu and
Kashmir was so successful why have these
attacks been happening we will stand in
solidarity yes what you say just make
one small point for five seconds yes sir
look look boo pain it's only two and a
half days ago that all political party
parties came up and said we support the
government whatever they want to do and
we stand by them I was expecting this to
last for at least a week or 10 days or
15 days I knew it cannot last longer
than that but so unfortunately it is not
lasted for days unfortunate today every
channel has got a debate on politics and
national security
you see the point Bookman is this that
we are in a threshold today Najib Razak
he had one minute ma'am ma'am one minute
ma'am you are very right I don't want to
question you all what I'm saying is on a
matter of principle on a matter of
principle I thought personally I may be
completely wrong I proved wrong actually
that we will unite together on politics
of Palama for at least 15 20 days but it
has not lost you to a nowadays I mean
there are all kinds of statements for
God's sake please have some respect for
people who are being killed please have
some respect for the entire nation who's
who is in mourning today if you go and
see the funerals today of 40 people and
most coming tomorrow and day after and
the one happened yesterday and today you
will find the nation is boiling with
anger absolutely can we just associate
ourselves with the anger and the people
can we say we will put the politics
behind us till this matter subsides
whether we take a decisive action of it
don't take a decisive action is a matter
to be seen in terms of time that's right
but can we just let this passion what
difficulty the nation is behaving today
we are for God's sake can we keep quiet
on this why so difficult aishwarya
general Shankar Prasad says let's keep
quiet on this whooping isn't impossible
to show any commerce of the society
boopin the fact of the matter is
whatever action the government wants to
take we will support but boopin let me
highlight precisely what sir said there
there is so much anger and outrage that
you're seeing an entire community of
Kashmiri is being targeted in the
government's it's silent this is not
about the place where you allow a purge
just because the people are so angry you
basically prevent further ostracization
you prevent further actions against
people that is going to probably turn
them against you the simple fact is
there are students all across the
country standed we're seeing two things
tape whatever action you want against
Pakistan take the strongest action we
will stand with you but ii do not
basically create this as a basis for
inciting violence you're seeing people
being followed by the Prime
inciting violence openly shield a
concealer so grace is warning people of
all of this the atmosphere in the
country is being worsened by the fact
general rotten peach in the last while
in the last one little aishwarya
aishwarya who's a very erudite a
spokesman of the congress party in the
last sixty Seconds has given us a
classic example of political
double-triple quadrangular pentagonal
speech she begins by saying then she
starts then she says today have been
killed in the valley today today I think
I have a problem I have a problem when
any political party comes on my program
and tries to take me in different
directions thinking that I will not call
you out while I will call you out if you
try if you try and take this debate on a
territory which you believe it suits you
I'm here to point out facts you please
tell me what would have prompted a name
change okay well can I make a point for
hours can I be a man the attack has
happened and even so Jeff Walla talks
about 50-60 Shan ji still in the early
turkey or how bad the situation we are
still in the hour of attack yes what did
the Prime Minister tweet in the hour of
attack look at the Twitter handle of
Primus so you are a spy no no wait a
second let's let's understand the
gravity or the post of Prime Minister
all the opposition parties even there's
an election right in front of us all of
us say we stand behind the Prime
Minister what did the Primus us to it
right right
the Prime Minister of India behind me
[Applause]
once again to show the support what is
it is to show the gravity
let the ruling party is up what is the
difference what is the difference
between you Varia Mahadev and gongchan
Tiwari Duda please tell me I'll tell you
the hare Islam I won this matter and it
is for them now they all get three of
you refer Assam and all the three of you
equally Gallia's respond please
when it comes to this battle of getting
votes or for Islam pleases can I just
respond yes yes yes please the Bhupen
but man it it is a huge tragedy
it was a huge tragedy and we were
expecting that at least on occasion like
this all the opposition parties they
will behave responsibly and with certain
amount of responsibility and for sure
they did the if you are talking about
the the the
to eat which was the which was sent by
the Honorable Prime Minister who else
will send that tweet about the assuring
and reassuring the people of it is
subject will not take action against
those perpetrators so who will send that
who will send that to it what was your
leaders we are doing we will do not we
do not want on this issue we do not want
to do - - my my with anyone we expect
every political party to wave sincere it
with sincerity and response with sense
of responsibility that it's the issue of
national interest it is something it is
an issue of national sovereignty it is
issues something where we have to
demonstrate something with to a enemy
country we have to come across as a
political party that we work for the
nation not for the only benefit of the
pillar of political he will represent
ice and that is what we are the
Dominical passion energy and that verbal
diarrhea you are having here from the
month of energy's party you're speaking
all nonsense I've heard him many times
yes your channel and other channel yes
you do not respect they are martyrs why
do not respect your daughter is right
and you live in they are acknowledging
and watching these people and you can
halt their disrespect the family they do
not even grief you know and you're so
solid directly with your space our GG
families of those martyrs now the party
absolutely clear suffered you one moment
you know what that's again I am
insisting and again I'm repeating for me
all the three politician on this panel
are equally guilty of committing the
same harakiri
now I think you are walking into a
self-created ramza for Islam because let
me play this statement which was made by
your party chief the day after this
incident happened
what did Amit Shah say just take a look
at what amateur says and conclude for
yourself whether any political party in
this country knows sometimes the
potential of just keeping silence just
just look at what amateur said in the
context of this attack
gentleman a congress key Sultana here is
bar Kendra me up jibin re party isn't a
party very moody sakakibara man PCB
frittata McGonagall
now tell me general Roy an attack has
happened on Thursday sir amateur
speaking on Saturday and now he wants
the people of this country to remember
that it's not the Congress party which
is in center is he also not guilty of
doing exactly what the his opponents
should are accusing about this has
become politically charged environment
let me move away from it a bit because
having been part of a a political army
Indian Army
what is indicative of is that it's all
kinds of ignorance which is flowing out
if you look at the statements made by
anybody no matter which party and who is
that individual whosoever in whatever
position including some of the debates
as well it just flows out of ignorance I
mean everybody shooting from the hip
what should be done but it is a
political interest when you say shoot
from the Haga
it's actually not shooting from the hip
yeah it's a well-thought-out political
strategy because they believe it suits
therefore therefore what happens is that
people instead of focusing their energy
energies on action and the options that
are available to deal with the issue
they starts focusing on what's and whys
of the incident which has occurred which
then takes its spin towards all kinds of
individual biases and views and whatever
I mean for example the clip that you
showed the BJP president should know
there is absolutely not an iota of
comparison to the situation of Kashmir
with what is in the same regardless of
whichever issue you pick up from these
two states there is no comparison so
putting it together in a speech like
this it just flows out ignorant Zafar
Islam no can we understand that what is
professionally right is politically not
right suffer what is recently yes first
let me respond
that absolutely see ya see the our body
president was only trying to give a
sense and what has been demonstrated
what we have done in 2017 we had
conducted a surgical strike and with
that time the army had conducted sac
that has been in the we are in the
nation this is what happens this is what
happens when politicians are around when
politicians are caught on the wrong foot
see how it irritates all of them strike
it was pure professional action you know
exactly asked if the surgical strike had
taken place political entities to
glorify it basically not be looking at
this realizing that the surgical strike
became a desolate yeah the surgical
strike became a starting point and if
the surgical strike became a starting
point then let us not accept let us not
accept any other behavior
let us not expect
other behavior from political class
Jennifer's I'm inside the point that you
wanted to make sir
yeah I I know I want to make something
more interesting no pain you know every
political party is trying to score
political points at the moment but the
entire nation what is the entire nation
debating in various homes and various
functions that the holdin various
evening that they spend together they
are all talking about what are the
options India is going to follow that's
the primary issue now government today
whoever is in power the Armed Forces the
intelligence agencies and all the other
functions in the government are applying
their mind to what is to resolute the
problem how to resolve this issue
they passion the nation are high what
are our objectives can we do it
immediately
what is Pakistan going to do about it
one of the internal people who are
building stones there are people this
evening you know people are buildings
200 this evening at the erection when
they was going on in Paloma these are
the issues the political parties must
apply their minds to and come out with
solutions to assist the government today
but yet we have you do you do do do
those who goes yeah you know I get a
clear tell these young people yes go pay
yeah go ahead sir good complete your
point sir buh-buh-bear just let me tell
these young people the one minute these
young people must understand that they
will score better points if they come
out with solutions to problems how to
deal with the separatists how to talk
about their assisting the perpetrators
of terrorism
how to stop these people pelting stones
and what are the possibilities that the
nation is going to face and what are the
what are these suggestions they can make
that is going to make them vote today it
is not going to make them in about maybe
is not up to their expectations or maybe
whatever not but this is the moment
where everybody on my right and all my
left hand in front and behind must all
hold his hand so that he can go ahead
can we get me why is it difficult why is
it so difficult I show energy for
politicians whether it's the Congress or
the Samajwadi Party or whichever a party
in this country we know that there is a
problem there is a crisis we all know
that India is angry people's anger is
boiling is it not possible for us not to
talk about this issue for some time if
politicians don't tweet you want to ask
question please feel free ask questions
but when mum that Banerjee takes this
position that there is a shadow war
which is taking place then it leads to
suspicions of all kinds of energy do you
support this
of shadow war which is unfolding kind of
a statement which is made by Mamta
Banerjee I'm not the TMC spokesperson
but the very simple fact boopin and
please and I hope that the gentlemen on
this panel will allow me 30 seconds and
then they may go on as to say whatever
they want including you the very simple
fact remains that we stand with our
armed forces that is unequivocal we
believe that very strong decisive action
has to be taken against terrorists as
well as the perpetrator and also the
person that is aiding and abetting these
terrorists there is no wavering on that
however the question that the nation
asks the question that the Congress
party asks is that if you believe that
the situation in the valley and with our
neighbors is so great that you are
hugging out Nawaz Sharif every other day
is why is this still happening and I
believe you want to take decisive action
MFN status does not accord to anything
because Saudi Arabia today who you
believe is a very good friend has
accorded millions and millions of work
to Pakistan again the fact of the matter
is if we are fighting an enemy we
shouldn't allow enemies within to
further disturb and harm the harmony
that India that's what we're doing now
is and that is extremely extremely enemy
and that is the police continue okay so
far no no she is preaching she is
preaching all of us what has not been
practiced by her own chief a
spokesperson what did he message what
did he tweet making that comment that is
what I think that
can I just say can I just say two things
let's just say if the opposition if the
opposition wishes to question the Prime
Minister wishes to question the BJP on
any policy matter by all means please
feel free on the day when the attack
happened
I myself we did a whole program he spent
an army had spokesperson from everywhere
all or all sides of political divide
looking this question whether there was
indeed an intelligence lapse now my
point is that questioning specifically
in the context of intelligence lapse -
all spokesman of the opposition
absolutely yes valid question but when
you take that premise when you make that
as a launching pad for you to throw
stones and for you to indulge in stone
pelting and missile throwing against the
government because you believe that that
is what will help your interests then I
have a problem with that because
suddenly you end up then creating an
environment or do I know that this
really happened because BJP wanted that
to happen I mean is that what we're
really talking about I mean people are
today tweeting what good timing the
timing is suspect and I've been
absolutely dazed that people are saying
the timing of this attack is suspect see
that I mean general right this is the
kind of qualities exactly what I said
that it just flows out of a huge
ignorance I don't understand this what
happens as a result of intelligence lag
absolute but then you say there's a
shadow but why question you say you are
you are doing it deliberately because
you want to win elections I've
questioned that even now that is not the
time for questioning is the time for
working out the options and going in for
action so let's have a do sir
that exact let's have a debate around
the exact nobody absolutely that is what
I said so much out of ignorance I think
it is out of mischief mischief yes miss
Jenkins on theory general and general
Prasad
we have the leadership and leadership is
about building unity not about finding
ways of disunity even on this panel
today on your panel I said I swear I
said others said did you find the BJP
the spokesperson of the government
trying to build unity it's an attempt to
build disunity so it's reward and
leadership of the Prime Minister Sajjan
for his ability no it's not to eat water
so they will the leadership that's all
that we achieve mantle in this country
right now is the Prime Minister it is
for him to build the you build the unity
take the nation forward in a course of
action rather than allowing his national
President to play politics rather than
allowing is leader to but everyone is
doing the leadership issue or leadership
issue let me tell you that everybody
wants to project that he or she is a
strong leader I'm a bigger leader now
the problem is that you can be big or
strong leader but they issue is that
whatever you are talking off is that
doable what are the implications of such
a talking that we don't want you
shooting from the hip so therefore the
only thing we know is that we'll keep
accusing the other side he will say the
people will be this David desire for
justice people of India who have marched
in every town with candles who have
stood with the families of our brave
hearts who are martyred and those who
are the brave hearts are still fighting
I think every one of them expect
leadership and in that we stand with the
Prime Minister it is for BJP to
demonstrate that they have a reverse
luck and lead rather than play over
itself again can see expect can can I
just put this question to all the three
of us you are Mr devs are for Islamic
names and sham Tiwari a monotheist
mandalas well can we expect some kind of
a template some kind of a of a letter a
moratorium of shorts that we will not
indulge in political blame game
political name-calling at least as far
as Palama is concerned there are enough
and more opportunities we can have
debates on economy we can have debates
on everything under the
but why convert this into a talking
point on the road to 2019 Zafar Islam
why shouldn't a BJP president say please
remember Congress is not in power and
you do what you want to do now why do
you want people of this country to
compare your actions with the word
wonder Congress may or may not have
terms are for Islam no no no see all I
can say that in certain contexts he said
because always the people were talking
board that army never had we're not
getting the kind of political mill they
needed and something which was
demonstrated in 2017 and that's what in
that context the Honorable party
president has mentioned that this
government had demonstrated will
demostrate again because it is something
to do with the nation and the national
security and something too we need to
have avenged and maybe we will take
revenge as something which he he wanted
to give a sense to the people of this
country that we are we we we are going
to do that and we all expect all we
expect from the opposition parties and
all the the political parties that stay
united because it's not a BJP agenda to
take this up in 2019 election can I can
I can I can I go this is possible area
is it possible for us to look for a
moratorium no blame game no name-calling
is that too much to expect from a
political class - well you know I
believe for the larger part of
moratorium already exists when you had
no official response to that that
honestly a shame of a joke by mr. a
speech by mr. Amit Shah today we could
have responded point by point fact is
this we have discussed it I will answer
yes one second yes yes yes yes yes right
we have desisted from making public
statements about anything of what they
are politicizing however please allow us
the Liberty and also exercise our
freedom of asking the government and
holding the government accountable if
there are lapses because over the past
two and a half years when the
do you believe do you believe this is a
nonsense do you believe do you believe
politician expect far more from former
people of our armed forces to remain
little courtesy to compute all we're
seeing is the very simple fact is we
will stand with you however you've been
saying the need to be asked in order to
prevent real action again and again
really that is all that my sayings
really that is what my categories say
generally believe is a democratic system
we have the right to you by that is this
one woman won over Rama and thank you
thank you for being so considerate as
Reggie but do you for a moment believe I
mean I'm asking everyone a straight
question and nobody's giving me a
straight answer
I'm saying observe a moratorium I'm
saying please don't indulge in
name-calling don't indulge in blame game
is it impossible is it too much to
expect you see the point is that if it
is to be done then everybody has to
remain involved with the national
security throughout the ten-yard it is
not that when something happens that
everybody starts talking about it the
basic problem here is that let me
correct here that army has never had any
any complaint on the political will to
do whatever the national leadership ever
wanted us to do the problem has always
been that army has been crying for their
own capacity and capability building
which again which again nobody wants it
and that's it and nobody wants to talk
about it therefore is this let me
correct through your viewers you army
has never never even once ever
complained about the political will to
power the nation final final word from
you can i I just like - I'm just
wondering I'm just wondering sir whether
is this how we will show respect to the
legacy to the deeds of our of our great
soldiers who've martyred to a martyr
there on that day when the bula mindset
happened even today even today we've
lost soldiers today and look at the
debate that we're having tonight I mean
is this how is this how they're you know
should remember that there is not even
one these are all public figures all of
them who are talking here none of them
have started with saying that today
we've lost these people how very
unfortunate they all remember all
remember where the next
we're saying that people won't how very
unfortunate so I want to ask how many
unfortunate let me hold all of you and
let me thank you for joining us on
viewpoint tonight okay I think you have
completely ran out of time but I have
one conclusion tonight I think that I
think it's impossible for us to expect
any kind of maturity from our political
class irrespective of what the issue is
there is no political party in this
country who will give up on that basic
desire of getting one more vote out of
the political ecosystem
you tell me how to deal with this I look
forward to hearing from you a viewpoint
section for big stories tonight and
their impact on the road to 2019 big
story number one the ultimate act of
political necessity much more economist
McCarthy was the big joke now see what's
happening in Maharashtra in Maharashtra
the Shiv Sena which has spent the better
part of the last three years only
directly abusing the BJP taking potshots
against a prime minister look at those
pictures today oh that are crate
shifts in a boss on the same table has
decided to mend his fences and get into
an alliance with the BJP for Maharashtra
the formula that has been worked out 23
seats the ships enough for loops of my
elections 25 with the BJP and then in
the assembly elections later this year
both sides will contest on a 50/50
formula BJP s alliance with the Shiv
Sena frankly is the oldest alliance in
the beach' piece of history the Alliance
was all but dead but it appears that
there is a realization that if you don't
stay together then your losses may end
up becoming big gains for the opponents
so certainly the BJP would hope that
this alliance will ensure that they come
up with better gains in the looks of
elections in Maharashtra big story
number two coming from West Bengal some
movement on the questioning front of
Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar
now what's in news 18 is learning is
that he's likely to be transferred from
Kolkata Police to state CID authorities
are saying that all this is a move
police reshuffling but Rajeev Kumar's
departure from the state from the
Kolkata Police Commissioner job means
entry of a new person as well I think
what it also shows is that mum that
Banerjee perhaps is realized that no one
gains by being constantly in
confrontation mode it may just enabled
VD to focus perhaps a little more on
administrative affairs which would be
good for the state of West Bengal big
story number three cricketer turned
politician Keerthi Azad is spanning up
for a new innings now having been
suspended from the BJP Azad an MP from
that Bunga has now officially joined the
Congress party he was welcomed by Rahul
Gandhi into the party fold and he began
right away by targeting BJP for lack of
internal democracy
kitty azad was a good all-rounder in his
time his movement to Congress will put
the BJP certainly as far as if the
Bangla seat is concerned where he
remains an important figure so you can
conclude that one seat less perhaps for
the BJP aligns with the dish Kumar in
the state of Bihar join number for
another year and another dividend being
given to government by the Reserve Bank
of India the RBI has declared that it
will be giving 28,000 crores as interim
dividend to the government it will help
the government enormously in terms of
dealing with its own fiscal deficit
target truth is it on earlier occasions
as well central banks have passed on
their entire dividends to government's
for their upkeep but it also leads to a
scenario where banks continue to remain
on a very very tight leash that's it
then for me I'll see you again tomorrow
night
till then bye good

speculation on again off again ships era
and the BJP have finally decided to set
aside their differences and fight the
upcoming local by-elections together the
two parties have finalized the seat
sharing arrangement for the ls polls
Shiv Sena will contestant 23 seats while
the BJP will fight on 25 for the
assembly polls they will have a 50/50
seat sharing deal in fact it was
announced in a grand press conference

chief so how do they bury the hatchet
vram for your after the announcement of
divorce he was finally an announcement
of patch up and loop house turning out
in the politics of Maharashtra the
biggest day for the politics of
Maharashtra really because within two to
three months when Maharashtra faces
looks about elections BJP and Shiv Sena
will fight together the most important
thing that sources within both the
parties tell us is that there were two
conditions on which the Shiv Sena was
hell-bent one on taking the pal girl
looks opposite now
our sources tell us that pal car Lok
Sabha seat will be swapped for mawa Lok
Sabha seat so the BJP will take mawa and
will handover palcohol to shell Sena it
was an emotional issue a bit of an ego
hassle for Shiv Sena that the pal car
seat belongs to them also with regards
to the state government and this is an
important announcement the Chief
Minister announced that during the
Vuitton Sabha elections not only the
responsibilities but the positions as
well will be distributed equally it is
possible that this might hint
a rotational term of the Chief
Minister's position because the Shiv
Sena was quite insistent that it get the
entire term of the chief minister
further law the ton Sabha elections
right now for the BJP the primary target
is the looks of my election they seem to
have been successful in convincing shiv
sena to bring them to table to convince
them in fighting the elections together
and this is likely to be beneficial for
both the parties considering that both
Congress and NCP have already reached a
consensus for alliance if these two
parties would not have come together
today there was a possibility that both
the parties would have felt really badly
in Maharashtra that possibility has been
halted now it is likely the the
predictions of several political experts
is that both these parties together may
look at something in the range of 30
plus from Marash draw a sizeable seat
share for the BJP all right we leave
that veneer Deshpande of mumbai bureau

hello I'm gonna rather say look there
the off-center conversation today is
with an artist who's come to epitomize
the clear preference that both
filmmakers and film goers are showing
for stories stories that probe record
and honor
the human condition to talk about his
life and his work my guest today is a
poet singer and actor please welcome
Josh man Khurana Irishman thank you so
much for talking to us thank you so much
for the wonderful intro wonderful in
drivelines we've pushed all your buttons
right all the right buttons have been
pushed in thank you so much Iceman 2018
was both incredibly successful and
incredibly challenging for you one yes
yeah yeah I want to start with the
success part of it okay I've heard you
say that with but hi-ho you as an actor
for the first time saw or got an opening
huh explain to people explain to
moviegoers what it means to get an
opening and how that's different from
what you have experienced in the past
which is that slow burn of word-of-mouth
of course most of my films are driven by
critical acclaim like if critics give
you a thumbs up then the film's work
they have most of the films are
word-of-mouth films because necess it's
not as a rule it's happened over the
years that my films have got not a great
opening but Monday becomes bigger than
Friday in terms of numbers because word
of mouth spreads it goes better and
better but in case of mirth hi here it
is little different day one had
incredible number so that was for the
first time so it happened with all the
stars so it establishes you as a star
when you when you get an opening when
people when the Friday numbers are good
to start with and better than the Monday
know that's right Wow so congratulations
Iseman that's a big mind story it is it
is it
like six years in the industry but it
was worth it so tell me success is
validation of your actions right of your
choices of the things you do when the
things you've done how does this success
that you are experiencing today in 2018
19 19 how is it different from the kind
of success you tasted in 2012 when you
made your debut with Vicky Donor and it
created such a splash and people
discovered you you know and and talked
to you 2012 was unbelievably crazy for
me because that was a time when I tasted
success for the first time my first fill
in great and you get a certain sense of
false confidence like a reality check
goes for a toss when you when you just
explore with your first film and there
was no guiding light for me per se you
know other the top rock came later in my
life so Jessica was busy with his own
films he's a he's a recluse he's not
that guy who will tell you what to do
yeah he's he's an artist he goes in his
shell while making his films so I was on
my own I had no idea how to handle
success you know the first film I was in
the limelight for the first time it just
went ahead it did personally it did but
for the outside world did not but I
think it just vacuums you when you
postal equation is goes for a toss after
you know tasting success you have no
time for a post in life everybody wants
a piece of you so it becomes really
difficult but this time around a more
level-headed I can I am somewhere in
between like I'm never too happy in able
to morose in a way in 2012 I was just
too happy I was just the world was like
a like a lot of land you know we wanted
only you yeah and you were happy to give
it
absolutely doubt any discretion or any
filters throughout since China I wanted
this and it's happening now
happen so why not I was asking 100
person to everybody which was not right
I think I'm so getting that married so
you know so it becomes difficult at
times no surprise okay
nothing which is this feel we were not
getting along really well after 2012
because when I was a VJ I used to shoot
like three days a month so life was a
holiday we were on a holiday every month
he was just traveling together we were
together but 2012 I had no time for
myself no time for her so I think it was
very difficult like that but this time
around I was well prepared and I know my
priorities now how much would you weigh
different factors in that kind of
choices that you've made and the kind of
films that have happened or contributed
to this introduction okay one is your
instinctive saying yes to a film the
second is a filmmakers decision to cast
you because they see you as suitable for
the role and the third is a producers
assessment of your viability if you look
at the four films that have been
successes in the last two years
what proportion what each of these
factors have played I think it could be
it
owners lies on the script right and the
filmmaker first of all to cast me in a
particular film but another was a rare
occurrence where I was the one who made
a call to shamrock when they I want to
work with them and that's unusual in
this business it's it's not unusual but
unusual part is the next part I'm
telling you that I I asked you to take
my screen test that if you think that I
am not fit for the role then take a
screen test
let's do couple of scenes jam and if you
like it let's go ahead with it so I
remember that day when I was outside
three on Bravo's office I was playing in
the car I was like this I have to do
this and I know it was a deliberate
effort from my side I was a very
laid-back person
I always thought that work will come to
me I should never chase work laid-back
or supremely confident boots take a mix
of both but this I wanted to make that
gear shift with another and as you said
that the filmmakers should be having
that faith in you that you need to be
fitting the character or not I believe
the situation should be they should cast
me in something where I am NOT a fit
that's how it will be challenging for me
as an actor if I am the fit that it will
become a typecast yeah so I want to
break that with another and I'm glad
that happened
you use the word typecast yeah okay
death success bring with it this this
danger of this problem of being typecast
because you're so good at a certain kind
of movie or in a certain kind of milieu
so the first choice and then you became
become a face the face of it and that's
good because you know it gets you
recognition it gets your appreciation
but at the same time the scope and the
range become you know become limited
isn't it
idly every actor slash star they have
they steeple
staple set of films like this is Death
Zone
everybody has their zone all USB yeah
and once in a while you can break that
zone like for example about the one he
has a certain zone but he will do an
October or so in here yeah the Iowa
certain zone under live in between yeah
you know like a tiger shroff as a zone
yeah like he'll discover his own how to
break out of it so I think every actor
has a zone you want to step out of it
once in a while but you cannot leave
your zone that's a USP how do you
balance it how do you manage that
staying in the zone because that is what
what you're good at and as successful
and has been recognized and on the other
hand the fact that the more you stay in
the zone you do more of the same thing
which can be not so exciting for the
artist is that the idea is to have
makuu outlook towards cinema like the
actors we artists are very selfish and
very we have evils that you know how
different am i looking in this film I
will give this profile and wear these
clothes which is your have you got the
right profile
I have no no it's fine yeah that's why
I'm cool so I don't bother about that
yeah anybody anymore anymore so yeah the
ideas to give a fresh story more than
anything else this give a film which is
absolutely new novel out of the box
which has no reference point to any of
the films in the past in in this Emma
that's the main idea so would it be fair
to say that actors like you are today
consciously chasing and pushing for new
stories and novelty and deeper
storytelling are you are actively
forcing when I say forcing you are
actively compelling the community to
look for this and to provide this there
is no option because right now we have
tremendous competition yeah from digital
media and that's the place that you can
go extremely radical yeah you can go
deep and buy your story with your
language also can go back do not smell
organic because censorship is easier
lenient yeah so you have to be different
when you when you let people spend money
for tickets you have to give them some
fresh content there's no other way out
by the same time I don't want to change
myself with every film I don't want to I
want to have a larger shelf life where
is the shock if you will just be
changing yourself in everything you need
X Austin is an actor stay there for a
while give them shock syndrome once in
once in two years or maybe you know you
last longer like that like people still
have not seen the negative side of mine
I'm throughout college days I've only
done negative parts in theatre I have
never done that in films I think I'll do
that after 14 I don't wanna do it right
now to be fair how would you describe
what you get
to the table and mana Rajkumar Rao also
does you know this kind of story
oriented cinema and there are so many
other actors who are now going down this
route so how do you distinction in your
head do you need to make the distinction
is of course the only promise that I
will give is that my films will be
interesting and really commercially
successful that's the promise I want to
give I don't compare myself or anybody
but my record has been more I don't know
it's it's it's Dutch food it's it's it's
it for the past two years I have given
four films which are commercially
successful and I will maintain that in
future as well I would think about how
engaging the story in entirety is that's
about it and of course in every every
actor will have competition physicality
and physical appearance is something
that women have to deal you know how
feel the pressure a lot I mean I don't
think you can even contemplate making a
career in the movies if you're a woman
and you're not extraordinarily beautiful
with men how much is the pressure to
look a certain way the pressure is equal
you'll never see any actor who's not
food these days male or a female like do
I'm doing content based cinema but
another had an even number the higher I
was like fit you know what the character
did not demand in a way but you know
back in the day we had Sanjeev Kumar's
yeah who had like boku quad bellied and
still stars it's not happening now but
at the same time if the if the character
demands I can go to that for that body
transformation or metamorphosis if I
have to bulk up I have never gotten that
opportunity till now to bulk up be very
muscular so that's good demands why not
but at the same time in this day a rage
everybody is fit many of your films have
ended up exploring the gender equation
in a certain way man women
man-woman relationship at a certain
level and sexual sexuality Indian
sexuality at a certain level okay in
different ways do you think that we are
more open today to talking about things
to discussing things and how much is
that openness coming from the fact that
women are standing up to assert their
identity and women are challenging the
established traditional patriarchal
system that we inhabit we have
definitely changed so much after
globalization it started I think when we
were venturing outside India we were
questioning a patriarchal society in now
I guess there's a lot of people who ever
converted from homophobic they have
become supporters of the gay community
it's like that which has happened
you know we are not patriarchy that that
patreon you used to be 90s of earlier so
I think we are seeing that paradigm
shift and as part of Indian cinema we
take something from the society and also
give back to the society it's a good
symbiotic relationship between the two
so I think it it's a very healthy
relationship that's why the some certain
kind of content is working now you study
journalism yes I can see that coming in
handy you'll be surprised that I you
know I started doing it because of
Shahrukh Khan's I have started mass comm
because of jobs a huge Shahrukh fan my I
always ought to be an actor how eat like
a guest in my room I used to have this
Dave das Kapusta Black Knight poster of
Shahrukh Khan and he was like doing that
growing up years and I used to see him
like talk so well being so intelligent
well-read and it was just to biame will
you yes domina beneath your vision
diversity but it will happen because of
Shahrukh Khan yeah so you know Irish man
I'm guessing that you don't have a
poster of anybody else up right now no
of course not right now no I'm just
kidding I'm just you know
that point with Shahrukh Khan who knows
who we are idolizing today who are you
idolizing today nobody you can you can
take inspiration from anybody in fact
the idea is the thing is many on your
teens that hero worship only happens
during that time there yeah you just
aspire to be somebody like somebody else
yeah when you in your teens right now is
discovering yourself you just leave that
paths you know as a kid I was a huge
Shahrukh fans such in fan louver artists
you know scoring more than such in these
days but I always be a such infant
because I was in my teens that time
teenagers now are Murad fans they're
always compared but for me such an is
God so it's always like that
so you actually come a long way from
from though seriously
but right now you can draw inspiration
to anybody right through a person who's
doing a mundane nine to five job and
still excited about the about life in
general
and I see actors are just blessed that
we are doing different parts every day
day in and day out different characters
playing different working on different
shifts these know routine has no
mentality yeah but I had my people who
are just doing the 9 to 5 jobs and I
still at it yeah which is amazing the
other biggest inspiration over the last
year or two years I'm guessing that life
is very challenging because we know that
your wife Tyra has successfully battled
with cancer but today it's successful at
that time it was the battle that you
were dealing with what what was that
like especially from the perspective of
the male partner in this relationship
because we are hearing about women come
up and talk about cancer and I have
and read Tahira talk about what she has
gone through what is expected what are
the challenges for the guy emotionally I
really don't understand why people like
tweet or DM me that you are the best
husband or they do did they do but what
obviously you what really what will you
do with the situation you will support a
wife right so how could I be the best
husband moving probably is the best five
who sees the one who is giving me the
security and the strength that you go
out go into your job and I'm fine I'll
deal with this and she's the strongest
woman I have ever come across like then
he got to know about we were in Delhi I
think it was just once that she cried
out loud after that I've never seen her
cry or question my head by me and she
was like she just like okay this is it
I'm gonna fight this out and that's it
it was as simple and as courageous as
I'm saying right now that she's she's
like this what how are you how did you
process it how did you deal with it how
did you partner her in it it was
difficult for sure but I was just doing
the basics right that I was with her
when she required in the hospital or
with the kids this is the first time I
was dealing with then you know the the
routine of life with the kids I was I
really felt like I don't know whether
it's it's a sex I'm sure I don't know
what to say like like how women in the
past worked with kids and they went for
work right now is doing that with yet
seeing that did the difference of fact
that they were doing their homework
they going for their classes and I'm
promoting my films at the same time so I
have grew a lot in these past six months
and
and it's changed me as a person overall
I always thought you know I'm the style
cover of the big car and give interviews
my films are getting released both are
looking very promising at the same time
in the background this was happening and
I was dealing with little issues of
housing a panini Generac saw the bottle
upon eternity like a kid has like cold
or cough I don't know I was dealing with
everything and and suddenly there was an
evolution you know there was a sudden
light from the top okay
probably I arrived now it's it's like
that so I think it was it was a great
learning experience for both of us do
you think this is something that men
don't ordinarily have to experience at
all actually
the I think we have this sense of
entitlement and we we will probably look
after the probably the classes or the
kids we go for the sports class or maybe
but with every these small rolls of rice
we don't pay heed to it's like this is
not a job we can't do this I think that
should change beyond the fact that you
have to rise up to the occasion of being
of looking after the family in a much
more hands-on direct way like the woman
normally ends up doing what is it that
you had to do for your partner I think
that is something that you can shed
light on as well
be there heimo just be there and give
all the love you can give all the
security that everything is fine
it was even while the partner is
suffering back back of her head it's
like she's thinking about the family are
they fine are the kids doing fine
fortunately they discovered only and it
was state zero when to stage one later
but chemo happened and she had to shave
off yeah like our son was lightly
something in seven so you had this peer
pressure and I don't know how my friends
react to it but I think she prepared him
also the same time tell me you studied
journalism even if it was to emulate
Shahrukh Khan you write you express
yourself and you've chosen poetry as a
form to express yourself you're an
artist every which way
what's the role you think of an artist
in society especially a society which is
a deeply politically polarized one it's
so difficult as an artist to just state
what you want to say I firmly believe
that right now I can only express
through my art through my films and the
right time will come you can you can
probably give your political stance but
this is not the right time I guess this
is the time where you should be as clean
as unblemished
because because you know playing
different roles in films you cannot be
known by Europe a Europe Punjabi or
you're a Hindu I used to wear a karate I
stopped wearing that I still wear a
thread around my eye stop doing that I
think you cannot be wearing your
religion your caste anything on your
sleeve as an artist you should be just
clean so when you have movies which are
making political statements which I came
back to openly by politicians of
whichever party is that something that
you feel is dangerous territory for an
artist you look I am NOT judgmental like
that if it's a she it's your art then
why not oh I don't know don't judge
others yeah would you do it
traditionally you know
we don't have biographies we have Hegira
fees yeah we don't give the negatives of
any person who's in public I'll be Tony
or anybody any political leader we are
not used to that
we don't make films like that that's a
tradition we have nobody will give that
permission to you
we are gonna negatively the house oh
yeah Marisa Whataya with the car though
nobody mean do that
so by default whatever you'll do as a
biography will be a geography but we
need to change that for sure like if
that person is for example a person is
not alive or if the family is open to it
okay let's go for it show everything I
think that would be amazing you waiting
for that transition to happen and move
in on a string but eventually I think
I'm certainly I get excited by good
scripts which are real which are organic
which shows everything so I think I
don't know I think I will only do which
excites me other person and political
it's politically motivated or fair as if
it has a political message or an agenda
then I would prefer not to do it at this
point agenda definitely not
I am i I don't know I'm not a jinx I'm
not a jingoistic person our nationalists
like I'll always be critical you know as
as citizens and always be critically so
you have to be a critic always just for
good for your own country so what is the
role of the artist as you see him or her
today the primary role is to entertain
entertain in entertainment is everything
like if you're giving entertainment to
people who are who are just depressed or
having this they they even leave
they're boring lives what else I think
it just boils down to entertainment this
is the second layer when you attain a
certain stature then probably think
about okay I shall make a statement and
then what are my statements exactly I
have no reasonable I think Irishman I
think we've hit that point in the
conversation where you've got to leave
us with a piece of music or a song that
you can play on a loop okay I will not
sing any of my personal songs I'll sing
one read to song if you're shot in Delhi
probably early 50s Dave Sahab and looted
i'm kim ji na Oh will you come over very
poker from Terry Gurkha something SD
Burman why is that special koozies it's
just for those challenging yes this
could be one of this but I don't have a
particular one favorite songs a lot of
favorite songs
yeah but this is just nostalgic for me
go for it discs of America a puka pukara
is una cara cara yeah hahaha are
typically a very super Napa but they had
to sit really hell-bent to recover the
I gotta cut off Sonora who they'll come
up of God gotta cut off it's so good
thank you like so I wish you all good
luck you thank you thank you

While the nation ...",2019-02-15T16:57:45Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4vEw5zZiq9s/hqdefault.jpg,"good evening the entire nation stands as
one as we take a look at these pictures
that are coming in live from the
Parliament Eckel Airport here in New
Delhi within the next few minutes we're
expecting the Prime Minister to arrive
here where 36 out of the 40 brave CRPF
Jevons who laid down their lives who
made the supreme sacrifice for you and
for me their bodies have been brought
back in caskets the Prime Minister will
be leading the nation as we pay a somber
lost respect as we tell them that we are
eternally grateful for them having made
the supreme sacrifice for you and for me
within the next few minutes we're
expecting the Prime Minister to arrive
there as we await his arrival as we
await him to lead the nation in paying
our homage to these brave sons of India
let's take a look at what all has
happened today it's been a busy day
after the worst terrorist strike on
Kashmiri soil in the last three decades
this is how India has responded so far
it's been a multi-pronged approach it
started with the Cabinet Committee on
security first thing in the morning
India has put Pakistan on notice it is
stalled Pakistan than it is withdrawing
the most favored nation status that's
been given to Pakistan a detailed note
will be put out by the Ministry of
Commerce number two in the afternoon the
foreign secretary summoned the Pakistani
High Commissioner to the MEA
headquarters and gave him a strong de
marche also the Indian High Commissioner
a JB Saria in Islamabad has been called
back to Delhi for consultations the
Pakistani envoy Salman Ahmad was issued
a very very strong D Marche about how
this is unacceptable as far as India is
concerned this is a red line that has
been crossed and there is a price to pay
not just that subsequent to that meeting
there have been a series of meetings of
ambassadors of different countries
including the permanent five members of
the Security Council the likes of China
US Britain France all of those countries
have been apprised about what the
current situation is and
is it that India is contemplating doing
perhaps not the details of it but
certainly the circumstances and the
context in why India needs to send out
this strong message and it's come
straight up from the from the top from
the Prime Minister himself right after
he convened that CCS meeting this
morning where it was decided that the
first line of attack is going to be
diplomatic as we await the prime
minister to come to the Parliament
ethnical area of the Delhi Airport and
pay his homage for those brave Jevons
who died the Prime Minister this morning
spoke right after that CCS meeting and
he said that the security forces have
been given full freedom they've been
given a free hand to retaliate at a time
and place of their choice he's also
called on the citizens of this country
to unite in this hour of grief

jaha Vanity Fair Oscar party IRA
Prime Minister extremely clear the date
time and place of the response will be
decided by the Armed Forces and the
response will be an emphatic one our
neighbour cannot get away thinking that
India will take this lying down
interestingly talking about our
neighbour and this is the first official
reaction we have got from a minister in
Pakistan in an exclusive conversation
with me
Pakistan's information minister Fawad
Chaudhary today told me that if India is
able to furnish direct evidence direct
evidence that implicates Masood Azhar
the head of the - a moment then Pakistan
will not block India's attempts at
blacklisting him at the UN Security
Council he's also said that they will
lean in on their close friends the
Chinese to stop blocking this bid if
there is evidence that directly links
Masood Azhar to what happened in polvo
listen to this exclusive conversation
I want to hear from you the information
Minister of Pakistan your first reaction
to the dastardly attack that we saw in
which 40 of our soldiers have been
killed yeah actually we have already
condemned this incident and obviously we
have condemned incidents of terrorism
everywhere in the world we are we have
suffered terrorism in our own country we
are the biggest victim of terrorism and
we surely condemn all these incidents
but actually it is sad that after the
incident the kind of environment that
has been tried to be created in India
where Pakistan has been blamed within
minutes that is actually unfortunate
because it was since our government has
taken over we are trying to normalize
relationship with India we have gone
extra mile actually to to putting out
fires and but the kind of reaction we
get is obviously it is kind of your
create hopelessness you do understand
the public sentiment here in India this
is the worst attack that's happened in
Kashmir in the last 30 years 40 soldiers
have died today the Indian government is
has withdrawn MFN status to Pakistan I
want your reaction to that that is
unfortunate again frankly Pakistan is
trying to create an environment where
the economic relation of both the
countries can be revived and at that
time I think it's most more to do with
the election and election environment
that is going in and in daily right now
the jesh a Mohammed has put out a an
ownership or claiming of responsibility
yesterday in a video of this other lemon
the terrorists who carried out the
attack yesterday
do you need more proof - antarians - not
really there are hundreds of judged
every every organisation call its its
itself ajosh so really it cannot be that
this - or what - but whatever what I
said if there is evidence if you want
any cooperation from Pakistan we are
more than willing to do that you have
leaned in on your friends the Chinese to
block the blacklisting of Masood Azhar
the
unce if this were to come up again would
you ask the Chinese not to block this
attempt India's attempt this needs this
needs and evidence this needs an
investigation and as I said we are
willing to cooperate within
investigation if India has any evidence
they'd like our cooperation in this we
are more than willing to do that but
this is what should be done now but at
the same time Indian administration need
to look inward also
all right the parks and information
minister saying that they are willing to
work with India if there is direct
evidence implicating muscles also let me
bring in my guests here in our studios
Major General retired a case of arch
defense expert melancholia spokesperson
of the BJP
Shabnam lone lawyer with the Supreme
Court and also a Kashmiri voice Dilip
Trivedi's former director-general of the
CRPF Sanjay Jha of the Congress and
shared only all caused the Ministry of
Defence for us so they're all on the
panel tonight as we see these pictures
from the polymer port and I'm going to
start with the images and so much I'm
not gonna mince words
enough is enough the time is up and the
Prime Minister himself has said the date
time and place of the response will be
chosen by the Armed Forces and it will
be emphatic our neighbour cannot get
away by thinking that a TK ho China
India will not respond we can manage
this absolutely Kaka they no denying the
fact now it is very clear that Jessie
Mohammed is the one which was involved
in that it is it is basically the Masuda
jerk who has been masterminding this
listing no enough is enough
Pakistan footprints are all over the
place and now Pakistan can't get away
what you're the watch Audrey information
minister is saying he was defensive he
knows it that that this has been
orchestrated by ISI and just say
Mohammed had done it now what can we do
I mean what should we do and what can we
this now we can do the following thing
one is that diplomatically and mentally
we have to do it and financially as far
as diplomatic concern you isolate
Pakistan try to make him declare him as
a terrorist state financially you put
pressure on the world over today they
are in a very precarious situation as
for a financially concerned they do not
have even two months of resolve for
their important their financial reserves
are less than Afghanistan they are going
with the begging wall to Saudi Arabia
UAE and IMF and China today Saudi Arabia
UAE has also condemned it they know this
so it is very clear signal
so therefore the Pakistan has to be
isolated internationally which hurts him
now I think that's a great point that
the general is less I think that's a
great point we will get to the military
but I want to emphasize on this this is
a great laverna Lynn :
regret the diplomatic community and
India in particular has right now
Pakistan is in a very very bad place
economically they've gone with a begging
bowl literally to the IMF if India is a
serious global power and if the pain of
this needs to be felt by the Pakistanis
we need to go to every global capital in
the world and tell them that look this
is a terror state this is a state that's
backing terrorist organizations please
don't pay their money will we will we
tell the IMF that will we tell the US
and the UN that nothing :
first of all Zafar this is really
heart-wrenching the kind of images we
are seeing it's an absolutely terrible
love terrorist strike and it has really
cost a lot of lights of our brave
soldiers what the government has said
under Prime Minister Modi it's
unequivocal faith here at present we
stand with each member of the armed
force and particularly the family
members of those who have been martyrs
with regards to what needs to be done
there is going to be a heavy price this
is an attack on India India's will and
India's identity if you would see and I
was noticing on your channel each name
was being played and that's commendable
they should not be forgotten it's almost
a mini India that you saw from the north
to the south east to the west that were
those 40 people representing different
parts of the country and the Honorable
Prime Minister said there will be a
heavy price let not Pakistan or those
who are responsible for this even for a
minute belief that there will not be a
heavy price of this secondly as a start
the withdrawal of the most favored
nation and also the result to
diplomatically begin whatever efforts
need to be taken that's been announced
the Honorable Home Minister is there
we've seen those visuals through the day
it is expected possibly tomorrow that in
all party meeting would be there because
this is something that all political
parties in India
would speak in one voice it's the loss
of our brave soldiers and what needs to
be done or discussed what we discussed
there
I think additionally whether those
options are to be financial diplomatic
or otherwise those will be decided and I
think we need to leave it in terms of
even with regard to what you mentioned
early in your program whether it's to be
a military option not to be we should
leave it to those who understand this
best definitely the pain is felt the
anger is evident and we all share it now
we need to ask ourselves one thing
Sanjay job how is it that a country that
is literally on its knees that as the
general said he barely has two months of
reserves left that is going with a
begging bowl to the IMF and to other
institutions globally how does it have
the gall to do this to our jo-ann's unit
you know zakah firstly a monumental
tragedy and I can tell you that perhaps
if you look at the the US foreign policy
and the Donald Trump you know his
disinterestedness in terms of you know
Afghanistan for example the withdrawal
of troops from Afghanistan I think the
Pakistani jihadi culture is going to get
a lot more belligerent recruitment of
Taliban with whom everybody knows that
the Pakistan terrorist groups of - as
well as Oscar have a lot of deeper
recruitment
shall we say strategies with I think on
our border we need to be concerned
because you know let me tell you that
it'll be naive on our part to assume
that there are not other suicide bombers
who have been similarly you know
hardwired so you know this is a
susceptible moment for India we have an
election coming up and Pakistan will do
everything to destabilize us I think you
know I was hearing the Pakistan
gentleman on your channel when you when
your program began yeah and you know for
him to make a statement that you know
there are hundreds of gestures in
Pakistan is a virtual public admission
that the Pakistan terror infrastructure
is Hydra headed and beyond just you know
Masood Azhar and and logic Ottawa so I
think we have
problem and I think at this point
recognizing the reality that you know we
have to we have military options can't
be denied we have diplomatic
alternatives and at the same time we
need to you know simultaneously look at
how we can contain what appears to be a
burgeoning a problem even in Kashmir so
I think at the end of the day it's going
to be good when all the political
parties get together because this is a
time for consensus and I think mr.
Gandhi articulated that need that you
know we are not we we are you know we
have been in government for 55 years
Jessica we have seen many wars under our
the time when we were in government and
we realized the national security risk
implications at this point for all of us
in our country we are saying I think and
this is heartening Rahul Gandhi's there
in the frame these are pictures from the
polym technical area as you see the
three service chiefs the army chief
first the Navy chief and now you're
seeing the air chief go down and pay
their last respects lay down that wreath
as a mark of respect for these forty
Germans who died in Palma let me get
shreya in as well as mr. Trivedi in
Shriya ah and I said this earlier on in
the program as well perhaps the only
silver lining that we've seen in all of
these dark clouds over the last 24 hours
post what happened in pol Varma is that
all political parties seem to be
speaking in in one voice they are all
saying that the nation comes first India
comes first
our forces come first hopefully this
unity will last for some time thank God
for that zakat thank God for that you
know we did see some bickering on
Twitter early this morning and when I
saw that I was hoping it would stop and
it has the Congress party and you have
such as you hear as well at the Congress
party early on on my show in the morning
as well had come out to say look this is
a moment when you need to stand by our
government back them and say do what you
need to do we are standing behind you
this is what the country needs and
thankfully this is how our opposition
parties in this bitter bitter election
battle have behaved and thank God for
that zakah as we see these pictures come
in really a thought too
those 40 families who will receive their
loved ones today this is their final
journey
sokka that we are seeing Rahul Gandhi on
our screens the Prime Minister expected
to arrive as well he's spoken mind you
today not once but twice you know
everyone's akka is talking about how
India will have to react because there's
an election 80 days down the line I just
hope that whatever India decides to do I
know there's a diplomatic offensive on
but whatever military offensive in their
sights to dude will not be dictated
either by the shrill war mongering that
we have heard in some television studios
all the compulsions of an election that
is just 80 days away the response so far
has been very much let's hope the spirit
continues all right as we see Rahul
Gandhi after whom Raj Verdun Roth or mo
s I and B as well as a former colonel
himself laying the wreath let me get mr.
Trivedi informer DG of the CRPF this is
this is the hardest thing so this is the
hardest time you've been the man who
commanded this force up until recently
what what what is going through your
mind as we see these pictures of you
know politicians the service chiefs all
of them coming down and and and laying
the wreath and paying their last
respects to these fallen 40 men well to
begin with you know it's it's it's like
a very personal loss to me having headed
this force and now seeing this kind of a
thing happening with with my men there
of course it's good to that everybody's
got together here and to pay their
condolences but I hope the spirit of
this together nest lasts for long and we
come out with such such kind of a
reaction we have talked about diplomatic
reactions we talked about military
reactions and I'm just talking about the
kind of police reactions that we need on
the ground for once we need to let the
CRPF retaliate if there is stone
throwing on them retaliate the way it is
mandated in the law we need to allow the
police to take a take on the overground
workers either it's not easy
they're already identified the lists of
their available people are known we need
to round up these people we need to
actually crackdown internally very
heavily in the valley it's a small area
of seven eight nine districts which is
affected with militancy with so much of
force available there in the valley I
mean it's time that you have to put
aside your sensibilities and somebody's
saying no it doesn't suit us if this
kind of action is taken or that kind of
action is taken now is the time to go
ahead and actually take the desired and
I'm putting it very clearly that it has
to be within the Mandate of law but then
it should not get that mandate of law
should not get influenced by some other
considerations that is the new data and
that is how we'll be able to stop such
incidents from occurring in the future
also no I I agree I agree with you sir I
mean we've been talking about military
option we've been talking about
diplomatic and so on but at the end of
the day the force that's lost its men is
the CRPF I mean Shabnam law and I think
this is a question that's worth asking
till til the day before yesterday this
this man this terrorists are the lemon
could have been a stone peltor we don't
know what drove him to to radicalization
so much so that he filled up an SUV with
200 kilograms of explosives and rammed
it onto a convoy of Jevons at some point
we need to ask this difficult question
of ourselves and this question needs to
be resonant in the valley Shabnam lone
what drives a 19 year old who's probably
never gone to Pakistan to fill up an SUV
full of explosives and ram it on to a
crpf convoy what drove him to this kind
of radicalization what kind of
completely misguided ideology is this
that drives him to do something like
this I think zakah you have put it in a
proper manner and these questions need
to be asked let me say from the valley
how we feel I'm saying these are sad
times
these are excruciating ly pain
all times for the common Kashmiri -
these are excruciating ly dangerous
times the valley is treading towards a
path where I sincerely feel there seems
to be a point of no return
well said Sokka this question how did a
Kashmir 19 year old boy who was a class
12 student become a suicide bomber well
this is something that all of us in the
valley have been breading this
generation of young kids and scholars
who are taking up guns most of them they
have been brought up in these thirty
years and this is what they have seen
guns violence and blood love in Kashmir
you must remember one thing
death is the norm it is not an exception
death of these valiant soldiers debt of
the common in Kashmiri death the stench
of death fills my Valley the stench of
blood fills the valley the question is
how do we go about this this very
painful conundrum now the common cash
marry caught in the conflicts of history
between the Indo pop pearl is the
political conflict on the one hand you
have India which says that Kashmir is my
a - tongue and on the other hand you
have Pakistan which says Kashmir is my
jugular the common cash marry caught in
this violent vortex somewhere is the
forgotten store one second one second
you have you have my hundred percent
empathise and sympathies for what the
ordinary Kashmiri is going through and
you are well within your right to
portray them as victims of violence over
the last thirty years or so but surely
Shabnam and please explain this to me
the answer to that cannot be more
violence the answer to that cannot be
strapping yourself onto an explosives
Laden vehicle and becoming a suicide
bomber there is no solution to anything
sokka please understand yes
please understand these are the
questions which biddeford the kashmiri
this is a younger generation which is
not in the control of its parents -
there is nothing we can do about it so
the state has to step in state has to
step in
not with flip-flop policies state has to
step in with policies which do not
undermine its dignity or its height the
question is has there been a flip-flop
policy yes there has been a flip-flop
policy look right one second one second
one second you are saying in general
Shabnam loans argument is this there is
an entirely new generation of
radicalized young Kashmiri 's who are
probably not even going to listen to
their parents leave alone listen to the
state but my point is you know a
flip-flop policy or a consistent policy
is not going to help solve that if
you're looking at a grave situation of
an entire generation of young
radicalized Kashmiri 's not willing to
listen to anyone but to follow this
completely warped misguided ideology and
nothing else then how are you going to
deal with that problem how are you going
to find a resolution to that problem as
I think we await the Prime Minister's
convoy are just pulling in at the Palama
technical airport my point is a car you
have hit the nail on the head the
radicalization is taking place in South
West meat they no denying that fact and
it is taking place in last about five
seven years now it is happening it this
adil i'ma watch a drop out from the
school yeah and he has joined in 2018
only last year so why is that youth
taking this gun why they are now even
becoming a suicide bomber so this is a
challenge what is happening they are
misled by social media they have been
misled by by the mosque they have been
misled by the society at a time but
whatever your parents what about society
what about community very common I will
even include the state but but the state
comes much later
yeah what about your immediate so
therefore we need to sanitize the whole
thing we have to ensure that they are
not radically they are misled and is is
playing a big role a lot of money is
also coming in south Kashmir
as we see a pictures of arvind kejriwal
the Delhi Chief Minister there laying
the wreath and and paying his homage but
Shabnam I mean you can't just wash away
your hands the parents of these people
cannot just wash up the wash away their
hands there are these inner circles
cannot wash away their hands it's not
just the responsibility of the state to
ensure that these fellows don't get
radicalized and then going Rams suicide
you know trucks into into SIA into CRPF
convoys true true jacques some some say
five percent or three percent are
radicalized but there are many of those
youths who are not radicalized yet they
take up the gun due to excess you
sometimes use of state power due to a
very violent human rights issues that
have taken place in the valley you
cannot brush everything under the carpet
the time has now come
you have to anybody takes arms up
against the stage you know what the law
is today as we are seeing arise not
seeing the Home Minister pays homage
we've got another lawyer on the panel so
let nothing Kohli respond to that I
think the law is absolutely clear if
anyone takes arms against the state he
will leave this face the law is
absolutely clear not in goalie on this
Zak I think we've been having a very
serious discussion and it's been broadly
nonpartisan so I'll also try to
contribute into the discussion in that
sense there are two or three things that
we need to look at if anyone picks up an
arm and challenges the might of the
state the state has to respond back
because one of the primary duties of the
state is to maintain law and order and
then let's not forget article 21 kicks
in in terms of right to life and liberty
and in that right to life and liberty
the protection of the right of the
citizen who goes about his daily or her
daily work that also if it's challenged
by violence of any form there has to be
retribution by the state the second part
of it is we must recognize that violence
also has its own issues with a circle of
violence which is what Shabnam ji is
pointing about now true there is that
you cannot say that every day if you
look at the whole if I may use the word
universe in the universe not everyone
whether you pick up a region or you pick
up a community or anything not everyone
is a fundamentalist yeah not all the
fundamentalists are extremists and not
all the extremists are terrorists so
therefore the terrorist is that one
isolated part which has to be dealt and
often with force the extremists have to
be brought back towards the fundamental
site and the fundamentals back to
normalcy
now society religion state everyone
works family they try to work to prevent
this from people moving into that zone
but what we need to understand is that
jumbo and Kashmir when shabanam ji
speaks on it it's an incomplete story
then we need to also recognize that
globally now there is a whole terror
mechanism that feeds by misusing the
name of Islam
radicalizes in the name of Islam and
actually goes against their religion as
my Muslim friends tell me because
nowhere does the religion say you should
do something like this so therefore
there is a global structure that is now
using technology the social media to
reach out and making it more challenging
now that is not a story of Jammu and
Kashmir either that is why the question
has to be asked why is it that these
terror groups are succeeding in crossing
boundaries Isis reaching out to people
across the world yeah getting people
even say places like Kerala and then you
have people in the mothers as helping
the government working with social
organizations to bring them back to
mainstream and remove their
psychological you know if I may say
their psychological washing or
brainwashing that takes place to push
them in ladies yeah
the life is good mr. Trivedi humanity
here in the same form there's a very
large issue the CRP 40 of whose people
have been have been slain and martyred
in in in Pulwama yesterday Shabnam
Shabnam lone says the issue is very
complicated you have to realize that 30
years of gun and violence an entire
generation has grown up seeing just guns
and violence so this is their way of
responding to it I gave the legal
argument that the law is very clear if
anybody dares takes weapons against the
state the law is absolutely crystal
clear against it the state will come
down on you hard but tell us practically
when you lead a contingent of men you
can't be looking at you know every stone
peltor or every terrorist and try and
look look at what reasons led to his or
her radicalization you've got to meet
force with force mr. Trivedi exactly
zakah you're quite right on that and the
point does remain that why advise the
police force put there why is the CRP of
there it is there for the for the
deparment Kashmiri it is there for them
for the cause of the state it is for the
cause of of maintaining peace in the
state and giving as mr. Kohli pointed
out the even the common citizen the
fundamental right to exercise his life
to live so the force has got there not
out of choice they have gone there for
it to do a job not their fee and as I've
said earlier we are only asking to do a
job within the mandated framework of law
we are not talking about going outside
the framework of law so where and on the
other hand we have people within the
valley saying that this youth is no
longer in our control so if it's not in
their control and when the and they are
out to do this kind of a damage then how
do the forces respond except by using
force so it at some point of time this
chain of force against force has to be
broken and has to be broken by the state
that's that's the only way out and
that's the only way out and it has been
the only way out in all terrorist
situations all over the world so nothing
nothing unique about it so what I'm
trying to just say is that we need to
let our forces do their policing job the
way it is required under the law without
saying that okay now we
things are better so remove roadblocks
let the convoys move along with common
vehicles no you look at it won't you
look at it historically - whether it's
the IRA whether it's the Chechen rebels
recommend to add their yeah yeah let me
just you know you know historically -
whether it's the IRA whether it's the
Chechen rebels anywhere where you have
seen insurgencies happen or where you've
seen militant sees happen even if the
Palestine is that is the most classic
example it's not led to any resolution
up to 70 years of this fight between
Israel and the Palestinians the only
places where it's led to any kind of
resolution is when the political process
has kicked in and this is no way our
dilemma door you know tying himself onto
a suicide the vehicle and ramming into a
crba my boy is no way to kickstart that
political process nothing cooling as we
await the Prime Minister I mean yeah
yeah I just want to put out a statistic
for our viewers you know you know I'm
sowing you know for the last one you're
also yeah there's a question that has
constantly been being raised which has -
may become a zero-sum game the fact is
if you look at statistics of the number
of terrorists who were killed last year
250 it was a particularly good year for
security forces how many terrorists are
active in the valley right now almost
300 you kill one there are two who will
pick up the gun whatever we are doing in
Kashmir do we even have a Kashmir policy
I don't think we do whatever we are
doing in Kashmir is not working the fact
is you cannot gun your way through
Kashmir
all right the army chief is on record to
say the solution cannot be military it
has to be political that political
solution has not even begun we are not
even thinking about it i things are done
and then Sanjay Jha
two three things one is there is an
example of one place where you've had a
cycle of almost 30 years of violence and
it's just south of India and Sri Lanka
where it could be said that you know and
it used to be said when I would go there
too that there was a whole generation to
generations of boys and girls who grew
up not knowing what it is to be without
a barricade of the road and you know
that comparison could be used in any
zone where you have security but today
that doesn't exist second part is what
the former GDG of crpf he was saying and
that's an important point that the
soldier or the security force personnel
is actually going tasked with a job they
have no desire to be wanting to police
or in fact be shooting or be involved in
gunfights where civilians I involved
because it makes their task doubly
challenging even terrible because in
crossfire there are innocents who are
going to be caught unlike a border way a
soldier standing knowing the enemies on
the other side and therefore can take
the steps what he or she is entitled to
the third part is that the security
forces and the army do try additionally
to work beyond the gun that's why you
have schools in places where schools
don't go work having help in medical
camps getting medical services and in
times of emergency we've seen that in
the floods in Jammu and Kashmir or
elsewhere so the holistic approach is
also followed but we can't deny the fact
that if there is violence there will be
the use of the counter-narrative which
is violence driven by the government
because the government has a duty and
obligation under the Constitution to
protect the life of the citizens from
those who bring violence amongst the
Sanjay Sanjay I think I think the great
example that Nollan pointed out the LTTE
problem in Sri Lanka went on for 30
years and finally took the might of the
state to crush it I'm not saying that
that's what we should do in Kashmir oh
that's the solution to push mean
certainly not but is the average Tamil
in Sri Lanka today better off or at
least facing less violence than he or
she was 10 years or 20 years ago the
answer is yes the point is if you take
all
you know militancy / insurgent movements
unless you move it to a a political
process eventually anis and a sense of
normalization you are not going to to
end this cycle of violence otherwise
we're just going to be stuck in this
cycle of violence the only difference
between the the LDT example and what's
happening in the schmear is you don't
have a hostile labor in Kashmir you have
one and you've got to find a way to deal
with it Sanjay see Sokka I think the
elephant in the room that we should not
ignore is the changing demographics of
Kashmir if you look at why Isis
sustained and you know continues to be
by the way is still a dangerous threat
although it's been beaten appreciably in
the in the Middle East is because they
were recruiting impressionable
susceptible youth on social media I mean
there are legendary stories of young men
and women in their teenage years leaving
a very comfortable existing in the in
Western Europe and joining the ISIS war
and you know actually kind of literally
thriving in that vulgar violence so I
think the big challenge that we have at
the moment is that you have a youth
today which is living at the age of
social media in the age of very
distorted history and very very you know
easy to indoctrinate and if these are
the challenges of modern modern
political systems that you can today in
swing a person who may be just a
college-going guy into into becoming a
suicide bomber so I think these are the
hard realities we are confronting I
think the point that they are made
therefore becomes very critical that the
state will always have the arms the
ammunition that defends the military but
you know there is also the second
component which is equally vital is how
do you very intelligently make the
outreach now obviously your cash bid we
have talked about it very often the
government makes an outreach you you hit
a stone wall and then you don't know
what to do which is why you know the
fine balance between what is sustainable
what is strategic and what is tactical
therefore there are no silver bullet
solutions and you know we have been you
know I think over several decades all
political parties have been guilty of
making their own errors yes therefore
it's a monumental challenge but you know
we need to confront it and we need to do
so so you know I head on our shoulders
certainly there are no solutions and
none of us here is a he's a dreamer to
believe in you know any kind of utopian
solution that will you know read
everything that's wrong with Kashmir and
suddenly it becomes paradise on earth I
want to ask Shabnam law and Sharia as
well as major general here some not
known but surely somebody should also
ask this question there have been
multiple outreach attempts from mr.
Vajpayee to mr. Manoj Singh and to mr.
Modi now who have sent multiple
interlocutors to try and engage with
various sections of four Kashmiri
society including the hurry up may I add
as much as I say that you know there is
no rational basis for why they should
speak for all of Kashmiri society but
having said that and as we see the the
images of the Prime Minister coming in
his convoy is just pulling in ah surely
what was the response every single time
whether it was the roundtable that mr.
Vajpayee convened or whether it was the
Meira Kumar had a three-member committee
that Manmohan Singh convened or Denis
Sharma who was sent by mr. Modi what was
the response
it was rebuffing right no not what I
feels Arkana we are having a very sane
and a very decent discussion and this is
a very sad moment what I would say is
now is the time to reassess and revisit
the Kashmir policy what we need to have
an India in New Delhi is a Kashmir
policy and a Pakistan policy you can't
have voices of cacophony now no can't
icarus voices you need to have these two
policies now just give me one second I'm
gonna just interrupt it's very sorry for
that Prime Minister Modi is just walking
in at the Parliament act achill Airport
and I want Rea also to weigh in on this
this is this is a somber occasion this
is a tough moment for us all
collectively as a nation and the Prime
Minister is leading the nation in paying
homage to these 40 men share see these
pictures
I want to tell you that there will not
be any closure for these 40 families
you've seen the impact of the explosion
people have been talking to on the
ground have been telling me almost
nothing survived so for a family a
finger is all they'll have for another
family you know Tarakan a torso is all
they'll have some will not be lucky
enough even to get that so for many many
families this evening in fact for all
these 40 families this evening there
will be no closure tomorrow of course
akka is going to be a day of funerals
tomorrow from across the country that's
for the moment just let's listen in to
what's going on Zach
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and as we pay homage to the 40 brave
Jevons who laid down their lives made
the supreme sacrifice for our nation
India will not forget their sacrifices
and India will not forgive those who
were the perpetrators of this dastardly
act that happened in poor Bama last
evening
the Prime Minister is leading the nation
in this extreme hour of grief in this
hour where we have all been touched in
one way or the other at the pictures
that have been coming out of pearl varma
the pictures of the families from
uttrakhand to karnataka to Maharashtra
every one of these families life is not
going to be the same for them from today
on and shreya is right there's probably
not going to be closure for them at
least we can do is to pray for them it's
listening
[Music]
[Music]
pays his tributes mr. Trivedi's also
here the former DG of the CRPF sir just
take us through this this ceremony it's
obviously the hardest thing to do when
you're leading a force definitely Zucker
it's a very very very difficult moment
for all of us in the uniform forces then
we have to go through this ceremony
where we pay tributes to the the mortal
remains of the brave hearts who have
sacrificed their lives for the country
and it's it's it's no easy moment it's
absolutely no easy moment as a matter of
fact right now even while speaking to
you I can I'm choked with emotions I'm
really not able to speak out the way I
would have liked to right now so I think
we just have to go through with this
moment till it ends and then come back
to talking on all this alright the Prime
Minister they're walking down the aisle
where all of these 36 36 out of the 40
bodies have been identified and they've
been brought back the remaining four is
still missing
sure the Prime Minister walking down
that that carpet that's been laid as he
pays his tributes and now he's walking
the other way respecting and paying
homage to each one of these fallen
brains with his hands folded czaka as if
he's thanking all these 36 40 crpf
Jevons who laid down their lives in full
wama yesterday he's thanking all of them
and i think we need to thank all these
soldiers and every soldier was right now
posted in Kashmir
who's going in there doing his job and
coming out
sometimes not coming out as well so this
is the Prime Minister leading the nation
in paying homage to the 40 fallen
soldiers but Sokka tomorrow is tomorrow
is going to be another day when we are
going to get some heart-wrenching
pictures from across the country
tomorrow is going to be the day of
funerals across the country 40 families
as I said will never get any closure
because some for for some the casket
will have what may be a finger for the
other maybe a torso for another one
maybe another limb in fact Sokka I don't
know whether you our viewers know this
or not but in a situation like this many
families will not even be in a position
to open the casket and and you know get
a last look of their loved ones or
whatever remains of him that that that's
how tragic it's going to be tomorrow
it's it's already a tragedy of epic
proportions but tomorrow the emotions
that you'll see from across the country
that is what will really be
heart-wrenching Sokka imagine to have
someone you love your father your
brother your son to come back home
wrapped in the tricolor like that
regional sbatch is here I'm sure as the
commander of your force this would have
been the hardest thing to do they call
this the golden phone call is it yeah
absolutely guys this is you know a very
delicate woman when you receive a news
of your near and dear have died this is
the hardest movement as to how do you
convey to the family you know this
ultimate that that our brave soldier
sacrifices life for the nation and you
know the whole world stopped as far as
that family concerns know that the way
it was happening like they were saying
the mortal remains of this brave heart
which is there you know that damage or
the impact of the SUV with 200 kg of
explosive was so huge that the book
completely the body of that bus as well
as SUV were were totally shattered you
know their bodies were thrown all over
the pieces to tell you frankly there is
no
motor remains which an impact they are
in a different different part you can't
even identify so therefore that what you
were saying four of them missing because
it's very very difficult to identify
when we were talking about the
radicalization please understand is that
if the radicalization is that due to the
fault done by the state as far as the
nation II concerned we can always take
correctly major India wants to take
corrective measures but what the point
is that the the signature and the front
Prince of Pakistan that involved okay
they are the one which are aiding
abetting tourism week and also radicular
you know that and and part of the reason
why we did not call a Pakistani guest on
this program is because frankly we've
been through this cycle of violence
we've been through episodes like Pulwama
maybe not the degree maybe not the
extent of the casualties but we've seen
terror attacks some of them even worse
than that what happened in Peru Amma we
need to find a way to break out of this
cycle but for the moment though we're
going to leave you with these pictures
for us
life will move on we will go on with our
businesses we will go on with our our
chores life will not be the same for
each one of those 40 families so as we
wrap up on those pictures spare a
thought for them as you hug your kids
tight tonight and duck them away to
sleep just remember that there is a kid
in each of those families there are kids
in each of those families who will be
sleeping tonight and and many nights to
come and and for the foreseeable future
they will not have someone to call as
their own father and I think that is the
most terrible thing that can happen to a
child
think about that pray for those children
and we'll leave you with these images
thanks for tuning in

its nose at Delhi last week Kolkata
thumbed her nose at Delhi so finally
Delhi realizes how cagey one feels like
being stuck with Delhi of course muffler
is in season now it's after April that I
don't understand the use of the muffler
well I am the PR officers cleared up the
controversy which happened in Parliament
the other day well I am ji did say he
wants Modi to return as PM but he did
not specify p.m. of which country
politicians are very wily very cunning
they understand how to work things
correctly in the final Lok Sabha session
the PM took shots around Gandhi Rahul in
turn was seen making notes and one note
read apparently note to self I owe the
PM two more hugs and one more wink
children in keeping with parliamentary
tradition valentine's day cards were not
exchanged between the ruling party and

headlines the Congress argues Rafael
celebrates Blanca and defends Robert BJP
member makes sexist statement about
Priyanka CAG report on Roe file where
does the Air Force stand and Modi ji
launches a brand new fast reign and our
top story the Congress yes the Congress
has been very busy this week first time
since 1982 Asian Games I was there
Commonwealth Games was different that
was NCP was very busy please understand
the difference anyway they've been busy
with press conferences leaked emails
accusing PM Modi of being a middleman in
their file deal celebrating Priyanka
Gandhi is return to politics and they've
also been busy defending Robert Vadra
with a straight back
sound effect for me joining us now is a
Ledge spokesperson for the spokesperson
of the Congress so that's one guy for
the other guy dr. sinja
mr. bubble people it's a bubble people
Thank You Cyrus it is an absolute
privilege to prima facie pro bono and
persona non grata remove any ambiguity
and to declare the bona fides of the
party's against malicious
misrepresentation of the material facts
and to discuss the local standing of the
accusers and accused in the privity of
contract as analysis procurator together
we can study the quantum of merit the
quanta Philemon and the Quantum of
Solace I will say this I'm not impressed
any more because I know you can get all
these words on Google but let's write
Hindi maybe Hindi will be easier
speaking Hindi then with a cube undies
sahaja do chika habla could she do no
gotcha blah in son this is a lifted poem
from a much better poet and
better-looking version of yourself I
would say so let's stick to English then
let's start with raw files come on Rahul
Gandhi this week has produced an email
everybody produces emails in India from
Airbus accusing the BJP of crony
capitalism I want you to talk about that
come on what can I say about Row 5 on
one side there is Rafael Nadal on the
other side there is Rafael de la really
who started on the intellectual high and
really yeah
okay BJP bashing now Rahul Gandhi has
been coming up with these corruption
charges on a daily basis but has the
Congress forgotten their own scandals
ever to remind you scandals like
Beaufort CW g2g call absolutely not
we haven't forgotten anything at all but
what the BJP is trying to do is unheard
of see that's what I'm not understanding
what are they trying to do scandals like
Bofur
CW g2g Cole took sixty years to do they
are trying to do it it fires that is
wrong are you proud of the scandals I'm
not following moving on I know it's an
old argument but since the entry of
Priyanka Gandhi the BJP has been
continuously accusing the Congress of
dynasty dynasty a dynasty
it's very simple the BJP is actually
jealous of dynasty I will try and
explain try and understand see their
leader the BJP leader was a tea seller
right right their leader was a tea
seller but they have no tea but they
have no tea sorry I now with Priyanka
Gandhi we have all the tea what the
beauty popularity and dynasty
intellectual high with poetry and
discourse and now we are falling below
the gutter itself this is your answer
this by the way do you know which tea
you remind me of integrity
no obesity both integrity and obesity
can live side by side like ebony and
ivory but let's talk about Robert Vadra
what is your view on the Edie's
interrogation of Robert Vadra I have
nothing against the Enforcement
Directorate after all they are doing
what they are supposed to do and we will
do what we are supposed to do I see and
what is that the IDI will do everything
to protect the law we will do everything
to protect the son in law now going back
to us poetry and the rhyme and reason
that I like the intellectual moment is
coming back for me and finally Rahul
Gandhi Union normal is thoroughly
Shankar Prasad has accused Rahul Gandhi
of being a lobbyist and a middleman for
Airbus a middleman I tell you that is
not true it is a baseless
negation Rahul Gandhi is not a lobbyist
at all if you want to call him/her
middlemen I can understand but lobbyists
never did you just say that Rahul Gandhi
is a middleman yes and I am proud to say
so
breaking news day ladies and gentleman I
senior Congress leader has just
announced a drought Gandhi is indeed a
middle man

been a middle man Wow see there is Sonia

middleman see understand Bollywood we

sexist remarks well I have it here
somewhere it's fallen actually but I
have it on record bJP MP Harish threw
away the same name as you said Priyanka
Gandhi wears jeans and t-shirt in Delhi
but when she visits a constituency
she wears sari in singular that is not a
sexist statement what is it it was not a
sexist statement tell me it is a fashion
statement the fashion statement are you
telling me the BJP is interested in
fashion we are a very fashion conscious
the BJP is very fashion conscious party
really
we are very fashionable you see look we
even have huge budget for fashion I
don't want to be rude sir but then why
are you so madly dressed because whole
budget is spent on Mata ji how I will be
very careful about that one I would be
very careful about that one it gets back
to Priyanka Gandhi now your party has
been abusing her since she entered
politics in fact one of your members
even called her mentally sick and
bipolar not one of our members is
Subramanyam Swamy called her that but
he's one of you who he's in the BJP I am
not so sure he's more like vidi-vidi you
mean a disease are you being disgusted
VD visiting dignitary
sometimes he's for us sometimes he's
against us but all times he's for
himself yeah all right I don't know what
that really means but let's talk about
Robert Vadra
what about him you know as soon as
Priyanka announcer entry into politics
the BJP said the e be upon him now isn't
that what we call dirty politics he is
guilty guilty of what what has he done
he is guilty of one big mistake he has
done you see he has expelled his own
name wrong well it is name wrong what do
you mean by that
there is no
in Robert no T in Robert our OBE are
with robber ah a cha I get it in one
sentence what is your party's problem
with Priyanka Gandhi see it is a pure
and simple dynastic politics great
grandfather grandmother father mother
and now all the children all family
members it's all dynastic politics no
but some say that even the BJP practices
dynastic politics come on hey how can
you say that BJP how can you say that
 appease dynastic politics I didn't
say that let's be clear I never say
anything some people say that then I
tell you what they say but there is huge
difference between Congress dynasty and
the BJP dynasty please tell us what is
the difference the Congress dynasty has
been ruled by many family members and
the BJP dynasty the BJP dynasty has only
one member and you dare say that twice
in one conversation who dare point
fingers be very careful sir now do you
accept last question that Priyanka
Gandhi's entry has made the BJP nervous
not at all not at all why you say that
come on you don't worry that Priyanka
may have huge support among the public
we do not need the public what are you
saying are you seriously telling me are
you saying that you do not need the
public yes we the BJP do not need the
public really because we already have
Republic we populate you mean the
concept the term or do you mean the TV
channel I will not change because the
point is they comment on everything that
is the problem that ladies and gentlemen
is the problem we take a break and then
we'll comment on things ourselves
welcome back and of course I want to
wish everybody happy Valentine's Day but
it's not like Diwali so I have to talk
to specific people so that special
someone happy Valentine's Day and to the
other special someone happy Valentine's
Day and to the one I met before those
two special someone's happy well the one
that what are they happy well and if

as many people happy Valentine's Day as
I can and by people I mean ladies of

Pandya please remember it's not I have
always respect for both genders and if
you're going to fight with me remember
some of the greatest legal minds of this
country are my friends and know me by
first name and for the names that you

if they could hide him from his wife on

apparently golly boy the Philmont
rappers from the slums who have a
meteoric rise to fame and fortune
released this week it's a beautiful
poignant heartwarming tale that confirms
one fabulous fact about India Indians
can't rap
they can't and what's this merry gali
man I mean that's an incomplete double
meaning lyric to begin with what the
full line should be merry Galena paquimé
Imelda
even in a slum which by the way is most
offensive than Mulvihill right now now
let's look at that a file deal from the
air forces point of view a CAG report
was tabled in Parliament comparing their
file deals negotiated by the UPA versus
the deal by the NDA it so appears that
the Modi government's agreement on the
roof I'll delay craft is actually two
point eight six percent cheaper than the
deal negotiated by the previous UPA so
where does that leave us now let's talk
to someone to whom this really matters a
member of the Air Force joining us now
is the alleged spokesperson for the
Indian Air Force cadet honey singh all
right all right
good day I would like to interject that
good be is actually a biscuit as you can
see it that's my diet normally but what
an interesting name you have cadet honey
singh ji i am named after famous singer
yo yo honey singh ur older than him how
could he be named anyway is it because
you sing like him that they call you
this no because he is always flying high
do you know this Hodja no we do pillow
this sajen oh ha ha
we do pillow of this Hodja no pilot that
singer if I may ask you look a bit old
to be a cadet mean you should have made
perhaps flight lesson and squadron
leader by now I agree sir
but in the Air Force we have a bit of a
problem what problem promotions are not
happening fast enough so and why is that
so so normally a car did become a flying
officer or a flight left in and after
two years of flying sir okay and a
squadron leader take six years of flying
six years so then what's the problem
flying what's the problem with flying
we're missing a very important
requirement for flying
what is this requirement is it training
no then what a plane what are you seeing
a plane yes we are waiting for planes
but how can India fight without planes
it's okay sir
in India we don't fight with plates we
don't fight with planes we fight over
plates to share you mean the whole row
file are all gone the BJP issue so what
is going to happen now the Indian Air
Force has decided it is already looking
to buy planes from Russia so you're
looking at Russian manufacturers now no
not Russian manufacturers in Russian
junkyards
what for second hang got PR old planes
cheap deals like you unnecessary cheap I
am don't need to point it out on
national television go on go on that is
all we can afford
I feel really sorry to hear this really
sorry no no don't worry
if we don't find the planes in Russia we
will find all planes somewhere else
we're on OLX and quicker good thought
but you know I need a phone actually a
secondhand phone also maybe I should
talk to you offline after some time but
it has to be a political solution for
this what do you think the government
should do according to me Rahul Gandhi
and OBC should stop interfering in
buying planes why we need someone
qualified and who do you think should
deal with this there is only one person
who is qualified to deal with planes who
deputy chief minister of Rajasthan who
such in pilot because he is the only
real pilot right right even his father
was a pilot dr. Vijay Mallya good idea
but the problem with Vijay Mallya is
that the flight takes off but never
returns
one style and that's the important thing
we still go in style now in a more
cheerful note the Prime Minister this
week flagged off the country's first get
this engine list semi-fast indigenously
manufactured train and it's called train
18 which is also as you can see the logo

ask for revenge I can't make the
argument as is being made by many others
across the media today Khun KABB at
lagoon let's go let's let's break down
Pakistan some are saying ruling a name
the shahadat of our ribs is not going to
be forgotten is the viewpoint being
expressed by many top ministers and I
can't say clearly standing here that
India without doubt stands as one in our
demand for justice but then you know
what I ask myself I'll ask myself did I
not say exactly the same lines I did not
make the same arguments when we happened
did we not make the same argument but
but hand could it happen in the interim
what did we do we said we're not going
to speak to Pakistan we continue to
tweet depending on our political
convenience and our political ease
whatever position politicians wanted to
take we continue to do that we went for
surgical strikes also and we created a
huge political hype around it and we
said the world has taken note of the
fact that India today is not soft path
so from our own Jaitley to Prime
Minister Modi to Home Minister Rajnath
Singh to Jitendra Singh everyone says
let's go all out and let's take the
match I say for all for all that I care
and for all that I want I say for sure
go to war against Pakistan but you also
if you want you ask for answers as well
from so called apologists but for God's
sake do you think where you will
ultimately reach surgical strikes have
happened what did that lead to that led
to the max amount of casualties along
the line of control English means the
largest number of casualties in the last
ten years so I say folks on a night like
this when the Josh of India when the
Josh of Indian soldiers clearly is being
targeted by these terror outfits like
the logical toy bar
when we have lost 14 of our brave crpf
Germans I think we must ask this
question do we really have a way ahead
do we really have answers to these
questions which continue to be posed by
terrorists at some point or the other
because otherwise all that we're doing
is it we're simply looking at each
occasion as an occasion in isolation and
we're not thinking what will happen two
to three years ahead just take a look at
exactly what happened today and when you
look at the sequence of events you'll
realize just how just how very easy just
how just how very easy it is sometimes
for these terrorists to get the better
of us just take a look at how this
entire unfortunate incident unfolded
it's been called the worst terror strike
the work almost as bad if not worse than
hoody and IEDs improvised explosive
device is planted in a civilian vehicle
this triggers as a CRP of convoy which
is passing through that area it consists
of 2,500 Jevons just for a moment just
for a moment pause and take a look at
that number 2500 crpf Jevons 78 buses
[Music]
2547 Jevons 78 buses a part of the
convoy worst impact is felt on the bus
which is carrying 30 to 50 Japan's word
coming out is said in total they were 40
40 soldiers on that past 39
crpf Germans and then there was a driver
all of them what coming out have passed
away in this unfortunate incident
Jessie mama claims responsibility a
video is put out by an individual who
claims to be a suicide bomber and says
it by the time you see this video I may
be dead but this will be my call for
justice now while while the sequence of
events was still being put together by
our security forces what was the
political class to and that's why I
began this program by saying that
politicians will look for opportunities
only and only
to score the momentary political point
they will not look for something in the
context of what India should be doing
five years hence so what have we got
we've got a barrage of tweets attack on
CRPF personnel in Kalama is despicable I
strongly condemn this dastardly attack
the sacrifices of our brave Jevons will
not go in vain is the viewpoint being
expressed by Prime Minister Modi Arun
Jaitley recovering recovering from his
illness what does he say he reminds him
there that we shall not forget what has
happened today and we shall ensure that
an unforgettable punishment is inflicted
on these cowards he goes on to say we
pray for speedy recovery of the injured
unforgettable lesson for this heinous
act BJP president Amit Shah was busy
campaigning what does he do paint beyond
words by the terror attack now soldiers
in the war an act of cowardice my
deepest condolences with the families VK
Singh former army chief present Union
Minister what does he say I salute he
says I salute their bravery eighteen
brave hearts from crpf laying down their
lives in Kalama and I promise that every
drop of our soldiers blood will be
avenged bubble Supriyo another top ghana
the BJP says really have no words to
condemn the nearly 40 brave hearts to
martyr today won't use any rhetoric
revenge revenge revenge revenge that's
the only word that comes to his mind
rats of MP of the BJP dr. sodium Swami
what is he saying break diplomatic
relations with Pakistan tonight itself
then drop on land for breaking Pakistan
into for
the Congress of course has been using
this opportunity to suggest that the BJP
has let down the people of India there
the commitments which were made by the
prime minister when he came to power in
2014 today our commitments which are
being shredded piece by piece but you
know what right at the outset before I
welcome our guests on the show tonight I
want to put up an unfortunate an
unfortunate and bitter piece of truth
and something which no one in India I
think wants to look at today and it
pains me folks it pains me when I look
at how intelligence failure in this
country ultimately leads to what we have
seen today unfold in Pulwama I want you
to take a good hard look at a story
which was done on news 18 calm just take
a look at how our reporters Hoffman she
actually in the month of in the month of
February itself how he had reported
exactly the same sequence of events
Joshi Muhammad all lashkar-e-taiba
working together to carry out this
terror strike spectacular car bomb
attack in Kashmir in the offing
telephone transcripts which were gotten
hold off by our investigating agencies
two points which stand out clearly point
number one that this was there was an
attempt which was being made for a
spectacular car bomb attack in the
valley and point number two that car was
going to be laden with explosives now
ask yourself what has happened today a
scorpio laden with over 100 kgs of
explosives a crpf Jevons bus being blown
to pieces is anyone going to look at
this tonight or will we all simply step
back and say let's go and let's make
Pakistan into four parts let me welcome
our first big guest on the show tonight
and let me get some clarity on this
story dr. subra swami joining us dr.
Swamy welcome I've been seeing your
tweets dr. Swamy but look at what we are
now reporting sir yes that is appears to
be a straightforward case of
intelligence failure would you agree
with me
would you agree with me sir that this
kind of an episode might happen unless
there was intelligence failure now I
don't agree with you why so I have been
in government
and I have friends in the government
even today and I'm have no I've got no
indication that we were there was an
intelligence failure that there was no
indication whatsoever but they I would
like you to remember one thing that is
easy to blame the intelligence failure
but that's ultimately what a passive
thing to prevent some event from
happening but they go on and on and
coming as they say we have to be lucky
only once where the Indians have to be
lucky every time we have to now have a
policy what is our policy we still have
most favored nation clause of the WTO
for the puffs of Pakistanis and it's up
one way yes they don't give it to us we
give it to them so why we have does
nothing about the white enemies where
parties in because there is war in power
is hunter you are in power in the state
of Jammu and Kashmir till you decided
that Mehbooba Mufti was not working as
per your political convenience and then
you decided to snap your ties with her
why should these questions not be pays
posed against algebra tonight sir I I
don't make policy for my for my party
government they don't listen to any of
us they make their decisions themselves
and there is they go by a kind of a
conventional wisdom that we should
strive for peace with Pakistan we hear
that from our elite here we hear them
from the Luo Tian's crowd cricket we had
to put up such a massive fight to see
that we don't play cricket what about
the Indus Valley our thing which we
unilaterally gave to Pakistan we can
take it away anytime there are so many
aspects d'Ivoire what's a need for an
embassy well it has no value at all let
those poor people there are living in
those people in the terror strikes
happen dr. Swamy when the Mumbai terror
strikes happened this is exactly what we
were told then that UPA government was
an indecisive government Manmohan Singh
was maan Mohan Singh it was a weak
government now you have a full majority
government sir you have a political
story which is unfolding on a daily
basis where your government is supposed
to be the most stable people
decisive government the most decisive
government in this country cannot take
these decisions that you're asking me
that you're telling me about today dr.
Swamy you are more interested in finding
whether I give an a-plus to the one on
the Modi government or a c-minus I'm not
concerned with that I am concerned with
the fact that every time I propose a
policy for Pakistan which is workable
all of you gang up and say I'm a war
monger I am an extremist I am a Muslim
hater
this kind of thing I am just saying
Pakistan is doing it with impunity you
have today capacity of over 2,000 drones
provided to you by the Israelis you can
go and knock out that fellow's claim the
credit
Jay's a mobile who gave Jay Sherman was
freedom it was a watch by government but
you are all replaced for the humanity of
mr. watch by the broad-mindedness he's a
man of your party so on he's a part of
your partner time for war
he's a part of your party mr. watch is a
part yes yes he he was a member of my
party but so was chamberland a member of
this church al was all the time would
you would you admit doctors what was a
mistake it was a mistake for your party
to be in an alliance with the PDP do you
believe war on terror do you believe the
Kashmir situation what you are what
should be you go and see your own you're
asking me go and see your own videos
from day one I said this is the wrong
thing that has happened and that it
should be broken up we had have a
defense minister giving on telephone a
clearance to register in a fire against
army people you remember that yes there
was no there was no action on that I I'm
not going to here is get into this
question of which party is wrong and
which party is right I am going to quote
into the principle what we need to do
today so tell me give me Bobby needs to
do this so give me two options dr. Swamy
give me two options well there's a well
I have a both immediate action and a
long-term action
first of all immediately we must break
diplomatic relations with Pakistan
we must cancel the
most favorite nation clause and we
should start now by Anna graduated way
to take care of the Indus water supply
that's how we should start and then we
should use drones to go and find where
mr. Joshi Mohammed this and kill him
cannot capture him one of the things has
to be done okay and we have to interact
with the Chinese and the Americans to
see that they are on our side all both
of them have grown away from us can I
ask because we have not understand or
anything so dr. Swamy can I ask you in
conclusion sir can I just ask you do we
really have a policy to deal with
Pakistan sir does this government have a
policy to deal with pockets not yet or
is Pakistan just already here Indian
political tool for the BJP to beat every
time there is an election I don't think
if we have any method or way of thinking
about Pakistan to think it as a tool it
can never be a tool it has made up black
in the face today how can you say that
we are using it as a tool because we
don't have a if you don't have a policy
if we don't have a policy then I'll I'm
liable to say this sir
that every time something happened that
means Pakistan is that now you can talk
on both sides of your mouth as they say
in America you you can't say that you
are using Pakistan as tool we have no
policy on Pakistan okay there is no
structured policy what is the structured
policy all right nobody's is ad hoc no
so it's ad hoc and no structured policy
thanks why am i dr. Swamy for being
blunt and candid as you always have been
at least you have some clarity as to
where a particular member of the ruling
the lines really stands let's take that
point forward and let's put the big
blunt question it's an inconvenient
question but I believe this question has
to be put on the table tonight is
India's war on terror simply put a
victim of politics the Congress wants us
to remember that Narendra Modi made some
commitments when he came to par the BJP
wants us to believe that there are
enough and more tenant apologists across
India in the garb of various political
parties and therefore there must be they
must be acted against full panel on all
sides joining us Praveen Swami my
colleague from our sister publication
first post is live with us MP not Adele
former IGP of crpf is here with us a
case a watch well-known defense analysts
live with us representing the political
class Amit ball we are
from the BJP got a Vallabh from the
Congress party and Minaj it Mundell from
the Trinamool Congress warm welcome to
all of you
Guruji let me first get this clear from
you you just heard what serene Swami was
saying 'die now I want to understand
from you sir good Randhir Singh
Surjewala are not have waited for a day
was it really essential that even why
even before the FI are registered by
Jammu and Kashmir police could have come
in public domain mr. Surjewala had to
remind us so what were the commitments
which are made by the BJP when they came
to bath why this missing urgency not
after day chocho busy first of all our
parties and on behalf of Congress party
we offer our deepest condolence 240
mighty servants of crpf then second
point as you heard from dr. Swamy
he himself is saying there is no policy
and this is the first government who
doesn't have any policy sometimes Prime
Minister lands directly to the celebrate
the birthday of the Nawaz Sharif he had
the cake and biryani diplomas what
policy on you and see we had a patent
code episode what was a new virus comes
to our length but yeah what policy do
hang on how many sales to one Police II
we we never had any such type of biryani
politics or diplomacy well never had so
today I don't want to talk on those
issues first thing today the country's
in anger and anguish we want some action
Modi's shi-jiiy should take some action
what I got fed up with that one asked
for year nine months more than 5000
ceasefire violation more than 480
Jevons market only in Kashmir Valley
280z
civilians were killed then why can't
Modi ji take any action this happened
you know Java ji it happened only
because of one reason that reason is
that that Modi ji tried to politicize
the army functions
please don't politicize the army
function let army function as per the
army norms security norms defense knobs
don't try to get the
the world of the army functioning but we
will do that these type of the problem
is our cool things today he's going to I
have pointed out a myth Malviya at the
beginning itself I pointed out two
things there is a story which was done
on news 18 calm and that story points
out very very clearly that their war
they were intelligence inputs which were
available that there was specific
intelligence which was available that
Luschka lloyd by gesture muhammad wat
planning a strike like this with a
vehicle which was related with
explosives firstly would you be willing
to accept it indeed an episode like this
an incident like this is strike like
this can not take place unless there is
intelligence failure at some level would
you accept that for c2dm in booping just
before I answer your questions you know
you spoke about what Surjewala tweeted
and you know it's very disappointing to
see something come out from the
opposition from somebody who's seen as
being very close to Rahul Gandhi this is
been the Congress's standard operating
procedure that every time there is a
terror attack the first thing that they
do is they politicize it and you know
it's not without because no you are
doing I'm having today
[Applause]
yeah you are talking about
shame on you I'm a Tommy Tommy remember
yes I want to make another very
important point yes the last two times
that an attack
like this happened on men in uniform we
know what Modi government did and
therefore we must be very conscious of
the fact that this is the government and
this is our army which other than Israel
and US have the ability to take out
people who attack our men so let's not
lose such a good strike party on such a
part three a myth is that what we're
looking at
we will keep we will come they will hit
us and we will hit back is that what
we're talking about okay listen
yes can I just finish yes please yes yes
so we must in such a delicate time not
let our emotion get ahead of us third
very importantly let's not speculate
what the government will do but the
government will do what is absolutely
necessary required and in full force and
there is precedence for it this is not a
government that will pussyfoot around
and we will know in some time now coming
to the important question about the
intelligence failure or lack of it that
you mentioned
now Bhuvan I have seen insurgency in the
valley very closely this is one of 78
vehicle convoy it was not an isolated
vehicle moving it was not a small convoy
it's a very large convoy it is
completely protected there are several
layers of security that go with it so I
don't think there is a question of
intelligence failure but an incident
like this happens when there is a
Fedayeen attack and when somebody is
decided that they are going to stake
their life for it and come what may and
some of the visuals that we've seen from
the spot really tell you that any amount
of security perhaps couldn't have only
limited so much you know fast I must
know what is behind a political class
whether it's the Congress party which
wants us to know how bad the BJP is or
the BJP which wants us to know how bad
the Congress's do you believe a word of
what is being said today by both these
gentlemen the pain that we have to write
about the party lines this is a national
you know cause we
we have to hit back the party time first
let's analyze this incident as we are
trying to convey what they're an
intelligence failure yes obviously some
intelligence failure is there
after all this magician what a myth
mafia says he outright it denies know
now if we live in denial that all is
well at our end nothing is wrong we are
no control of the situation then sir we
are basically inviting ourselves
critical inviting our soldiers to be to
fall prey to the next such to I I will
can you know explain to you what is the
intention failure we know it that it's a
type of incident can take place yes we
have got a warning we have been already
for one the last great turbines I say
moment are going to do it but what
happening is that we are in a situation
like Kashmir Valley where things are
very hot from day one you know at time
until less you do not get actionable
ain't it is not possible to stop this
sort of strike now this is the vehicle
the road opening has been already done
in the morning the area has been
sanitized almost 500 meter on the either
side and there is a lot of convoy which
is going on
not since the vehicles who are not
flying for a fourth icing date and large
convoy one left so mistake number one we
should not have allowed such a large
convoy to go below it buses will go here
because it become one neighbor it become
one ever relation could have traveled so
Kat Von D eight buses currency values on
the move absolutely second thing it that
such type of incident can take place but
if our intention cease are there then if
we have got the input then we can take a
pre empty major but the point is the
input is there that's the point I'm
trying to argue yeah I'm saying the
world is saying we will attack Pakistan
I am saying why aren't we willing to
accept that's maybe something went wrong
at our end no we always carry out let me
tell you where I was I mean we can we
can think in terms of bringing like
Vijay Mallya tell you other things are
being brought from outside but when it
comes to looking looking inward we have
to we have we don't want to point
fingers so let us say the army CRP of
the security forces whenever such
incident take place we look into it what
are the reason which had taken place
what I have the lesson which we will
learn how we could have stopped it we
are saying we must be if we close our
option like that we will never learn I
mean it is become our target is normal I
mean is Istanbul good point we made the
vengeance to watch that
78 buses moving together over 2500 CRPF
Jevons moving together
firstly in the system in the chain of
command how many people would have had
access to this information that at this
point of time this convoy is on the move
Lupe actually everywhere in Kashmir
everyone would have known there's only
one highway in and out across the bunny
hole pass every winter that highway gets
blocked for great lengths of time snow
piles up traffic get stuck in enormous
numbers and when the road opens everyone
needs to get out of there before it
starts snowing again in the roads jammed
again on this Highway in any case this
business of sanitization is not possible
there are tens of thousands of vehicles
flying on it every day it is not humanly
possible to segregate military traffic
from civilian traffic without just
creating absolute havoc now in an ideal
world would you have some system where
you know you could do this over periods
of time or sealed roads yes maybe in an
ideal but you I want to convey that here
the vehicle was parked the civilian
vehicle which was laden with explosive
what part one to the side so and we
don't know when I mean I am assuming
that when a vehicle has to be fitted
with over hundred kg of explosives
actually would take some time actually
bookman it doesn't it doesn't take very
much to do the explosive standardly used
move from point A to the point where the
vehicle must have been parked for you to
but you know you know that every vehicle
has to come down that road you just sit
there and you wait it's not a very
complicated thing to do when you know
traffic has piled up on the other side
remember on this side too there are
hundred what he's trying to convey that
to know that this vehicle is laden with
explosive it's very difficult and
illness you have a pinpoint input their
key something is going to happen today
itself second thing is that this vehicle
watched stationary there is an awe of
scope which is coming a Waker can move
in an opposite direction in a slow speed
and if a convoy is about 40 to 50 acre
it will strike somewhere it will cause a
casualty
because it is a it is a feline type of
attack poop anywhere you go to Kashmir
tomorrow morning you will see convoys
just like this going down that road the
army has huge amounts of
police but it has to keep moving the
problem also is that making explosive
isn't a very difficult thing to do I
don't want to take names of agricultural
substances used in this attack but you
can go behind our office to the nearest
nursery and get you know I think I think
miss Praveen will be making too
simplistic in energy you are talking
about a place like Kashmir where you
have the entire country's armed forces
and in various in various strengths have
gathered there are we to understand that
despite the presence and the presence of
troops is only increase it does not come
down still the terrorists the anti India
element still have the element of
surprise with it and that largely
because there has been some intelligence
failure there's no doubt about it so
let's accept that without which this
kind of episode over I have being very
good inputs because of which a lot of
successful operation has been carried
out and the militants have been having a
tough time and there is one reason why
they must have thought of respectfully
disagree a little the story we have or
news 18 comm actually tells us that
there was reasonably good intelligence
phone transcripts phone transmit but
here's the thing movement these kinds of
operations nine times out of ten will
lead you to success every day there are
plots being busted terrorists being
killed but nowhere in the world are you
going to get through to every I mean dr.
Swamy is right nowhere in the world is
every plot going to be stopped in
they've been explosions in New York
where people knew the bomber was going
to strike but just because you know a
guys on the phone telling someone else
to do something and you have an idea
where it is doesn't mean that you
necessarily know that this car is going
to do it at this time
on one hand on one hand I've just proven
that this kind of an episode would not
have happened without intelligence
failure and gentlemen who are looking at
the security setup are in agreement with
me please tell me Gore Golani if indeed
there was a security failure
intelligence failure I am now getting to
hear from unit minister Jitendra Singh
that all those politicians who take
positions in favour of terrorists
and I'd read that as national conference
and qui TP because immediately from Omar
Abdullah to Mohammed they are busy now
taking to Twitter they should be they
should be barred from contesting
elections gorgotron e is that the road
ahead
let's bar everybody let's morrow
everybody who takes any sympathetic
position let's bar everybody
I think pain I mean this is a again a
very very simplistic and very nave kind
of thinking need of rhetoric nor such
kind of you know you know spider-man
like statements will work you know
actually what New Delhi and Islamabad
have to do is to take a cue from the
Taliban Afghan you know talks with the
US or the Northern Ireland model or East
Timor Indonesia model and resolve this
dispute you know all lives matter
whether the Kashmiri dies on a daily
basis or whether a soldier you know
Indian soldier dies on Kashmiri soil
these are all at the end of the day they
are all human beings they have families
to you know feed so you know you will
talk about OD surgical strike and then
these attacks will continue to happen
again and again and this vicious cycle
of violence will go on and on you know
there is no stopping and there will be
politicians talking about you know these
political statements rhetorical
utterances but that will not resolve
Rashmi Kashmir is a dispute and for that
you have to take lessons from only Tom's
full models so you believe only talk
yeah and come on to the come on to the
negotiating table and what people have
thought people will accuse you guys but
people will accuse you you know what a
long history New Deal but God people say
that for the longest time we've had also
we've had the model of talks we've held
important of surgical strikes and yet
his bill Mujahideen new belly has talked
to his Balu jython in July 2000 along to
Sharad money the then Deputy Prime
Minister of India has received the
hariya Tim Kelly you know mr. Jesmond
Singh has gone with the IC eight one
four and accompanied three militants
including the jay-z Mohammed chief so
these you know the kind of statements
that the BJP politicians are making now
is it's all politics with an eye on the
forthcoming elections that does not
resolve things you know the things that
come is a dispute and this is a elephant
in the room
and you have to resolve it today
tomorrow or day after
mono chick bundle I'm looking at
looking at the moves which are being
made by Monta Banerjee there was a West
Bengal Chief Minister month at the
yesterday and today in Delhi doing this
dharna market bundle and then comes the
Sarah strike do you believe it's
possible is it really possible for Mahad
month on or month adidas get but never
any cut one then actually two very
political differences very political
differences and speak as one rather than
speaking in a voice of Randeep Surjewala
or for that matter the package of the
party leadership mr. cha me while we
salute the martyrs and stand shoulder to
shoulder to all the families of the
brain I mean definitely month of energy
was one of the very few politicians
first to you know you know extend her
support to the families of the mater I
mean there's no question of you know
disputing the fact that Kashmir is a
failure as well at successive
governments concern and we definitely
will support any kinds of endeavor that
in you leads to a kind of permanent
solution but look at the history for the
last 70 years no government has been
successful in resolving this issue and
that they're really in the raises a kind
of suspicion in the minds of the common
people that is there any any kind of
Haughton endeavor to have this issue
resolved permanently for political class
beat the EPO beat the NDA this one to
keep this issue alive for political
purposes the kind of rhetoric that we
have been seeing for the last three year
I mean I mean use of word or granny
point I just want to understand I just
want to understand you rightly pointed
out to mr. Sukhram now show me that you
had a company yeah to it into a Buchanan
community see you can't come to any
convention yes I mean that that is that
that itself speaks volume a fact that
whether the political class one of the
government's in the central use of
outdoor gallery so dog Lonnie says only
talks
talk with these people who are dissolved
by the Pakistani she is Dublin and can't
be possible this will not be no not be
hold by Pakistan disturbance and we we
all know that terrorism end cuz main is
actually sponsored by the Pakistani
government everybody cause if this is
open
you have it America it is a America
every why these these resolutions there
of any kind of I'm looking now I'm
looking tweet after tweet which is being
put up by our chief spokesperson Randeep
Singh Surjewala who's only interested in
making political points G who only wants
us to know that nothing the body has
failed
G now I have proven here that our
intelligence agencies have failed but I
want to say even if I accept that Prime
Minister Modi has failed does this solve
the problem Coralville does it solve the
problem that we have we have a problem
first thing let's identify the cobbler
who pinched and let's talk well yes yes
boop ng yes I agree with you that there
is a problem and everybody on the panel
agreed that this is intelligence failure
because 350 kgs of RDX or ie D or any
other explosive is moving and
intelligence is not aware of that I
think this is a pure case of
intelligence failure but had you seen
what BJP spokesperson is talking that
why Randeep Surjewala were defeated in
her ear because yesterday what would
people died there are these locals go
away your highness looks a dog a
political point
so what do I care you know yes say we
give mr. cow is attached ovg WAP to star
by a two-dimensional array and the
second thing he won't eat you get out of
here but IANA get her up second thing
second thing second thing with who
Benjie second thing when 26/11 happened
entire country was there fighting with
our soldiers at Bombay what at that
moment
mr. Modi who was that Chief Minister of
Gujarat he was doing press conference in
Delhi and he was saying something other
when we expected that he will be with us
with our brave soldiers a man he was
standing against them I mean and today
they are talking about us I mean hi we
want action we the country's in anger
what I don't know is BR everyone I will
know what is happening now we all are
does actually want every three months
upper mooring a goose egg Oh actually if
that I you know
[Applause]
you should have you should have you
should Bhupen D you should have
one-sided policy no fluctuating policy
how much Babi Yar nor but what else is
one-sided
we shall what is the I mean I'm asking
ya wiper trial court was investigated by
shouting yes I mean right thank you
you know boopin I think let's not get
into 26 11 and several other incidents
that happen in the past because we know
what we did as the country which is
nothing except sending dossiers so let's
not go down that path where we are going
to get nothing at all but the important
question that we must answer here that
if the valley has been up in flames
it's not happened now it's the case
since the 80s in the last five years
that mr. Modi's government has been
there almost 250 to 300 terrorists have
been neutralized in the valley by some
estimates there are about 80 85
terrorists who are foreign mercenaries
who are still active in the valley and
they had managed to radicalize a few
boys in the valley and this guy today
who has acted as Fedayeen is one of
those men who was highly radicalized and
has been used as a fiddle
now given this context and given the
fact that for so many decades we've
already been talking to Pakistan today
there is a government that has taken a
very clear policy that there will be no
talk till there is terror and we stuck
to it we have not had a Sharm el-sheikh
like same one in the five years what has
been a chance yes I'm coming - okay I'm
coming to that just see the patient yes
yes look this is a war like situation
the three districts of South Kashmir is
where most of militancy is the Modi
government on the one hand has taken a
muscular policy and on the other hand
there is a great deal of outreach to the
youth in the valley and that is
dramatically changed to this course
please understand that if a dying attack
like this is have
turning and if DJ is using a local boy
to do it they're trying to make a point
that not what have you been doing for
the last four and a half years Amalfi ah
that's what I'm trying to understand for
the last better pile of one-and-a-half
years you are in alliance with Mehbooba
mostly there in Jammu and Kashmir you
have been there in part of the center
Prime Minister Modi tells Parliament
least number of terror strikes have
happened and then now our brave demands
are gone now we can keep arguing to cows
come home but it still it still beats me
as to what is the strategy or what is
the road ahead
whatever lip can you suggest some road
ahead sue brain of Swami make sure he
says the other two things will you gone
up water sharing we will remove the most
favored nation status I why can't we do
these things I agree book I agree with
mr. Swamy that why we are having most
favored nation status with Pakistan and
and choppa gee it is not the first major
terror attack in last four years nine
months it is the 18th and this is the
worst we're 14 Devils Marty and he is
talking about politics we should have
only one policy for Pakistan that till
the time he's supporting the terror
activities no relationship no most
favored nation no Indus Valley industry
where can you miss mom will shoot can
you give me a Shirley a visor we should
come out of that I mean all I ask for is
one step can you give me a direct answer
tonight on the program viewers are angry
viewers are constantly tweeting putting
these messages on facebook that how
exactly are we to deal with this fact
that terrorists are targeting our Josh
there was the entire Union camera and
everyone was saying how the Josh because
there was a movie that was made a newly
surgical strikes and now this is reality
for movie we wanted to take credit now
for what happens in reality we are
saying yeah I will all think about it
give me one quantifiable action now with
my there boo pain is very easy for
somebody like god of allah to sit in
opposition and raise the sentiments
because it suits them politically but as
a government and power and as a
government that means
and we've shown that with the surgical
strikes he's shown that by ranging the
depth of our men in uniform in Arunachal
we will only do what is appropriate and
we will do it with full force as far as
other diplomatic measures are concerned
today Pakistan is completely isolated on
the diplomatic stage as far as other
measures that people keep talking about
shut down in this water treaty
you know descend on this most favored
nation status you go to understand that
there are steps that you take in
measured quantity you want a point where
you have nations I mean nations like
Bangladesh and Sri Lanka we know
everybody can understand the purpose of
NRC we're antagonizing our friend
relations who have been helping us for
years I mean this government's foreign
policy itself is faulty and they're all
doing it for nothing
I mean there are statements which are
coming from the French Embassy and
everyone is standing shoulder to
shoulder with India but let's only look
at India because u.s. is not going to
come in Epis in our back we have to
answer what is it that we can do I'm a
father says there will be measured
approach there is a I'm told that there
is a cabinet committed security meeting
which has been called tomorrow yeah what
can be done say in the next one what can
be done we can see we need to do two
ways one either internal what we can do
external either internally concerned we
are quite successful we are going for
all-out operation and we have been such
like what we did surgical strikes no I'm
[ __ ] sorry the bunch of fools they be
waiting for us then now oh now now the
strike has happened so India will come
they do not register what I'm saying
ever an internally concerned we are at
it we are killing the terrorists and the
terrorism is at under control
that terrorists are not able to
infiltrate it is only the radicalization
which is taking place in south Kashmir
which we have to take a case now what is
to be done as for a Pakistani concern
because it is it is he who is aiding and
abetting the terrorism we have to hit a
very
are they absolutely correct what you
said we did surgical strike one where we
have physically crossed and gone to
their launch pad and kill the terrorists
as well as certain people who are
guarding them now you cannot do the same
thing because they are already waiting
for you they have any other method so
there there are armed drones I'm just
trying to convey please listen to me
they're armed drones which are there we
finally know very the training camps
where are the headquarter of just a
moment let's create Oba we also know
where are their launch pad so we can
strike with the drones which are armed
no I'm just saying please listen to me
open it is the drones which you have got
from Israel we have to have survived
even to believe that we have a missile
where you can attack Lahore while
sitting in Pakistan while sitting maybe
there is no I am saying that there is no
eating which I may not be a easy job you
know you cannot start a war a once you
hit them halfway
how do you do that you don't start a war
but in flick limited calzones that can
be used throwing across the waters also
and they can definitely be successful in
containing the kind of terrorism that is
taking place which you can give them
heavy punishment I've been already given
to them let me tell you that these
understand that I commanded a brigade
there in mustard sector we hurt them so
much my point is that you finish off
that post hit them there from there it
has career ain't working when which year
were you why were there from 2006 to
2008 and you know we're in 2019 sir from
2006 to 2009 teen you hurt them well
where it hurt them the most yeah
successive commanders also hurts them
the most and we're still losing our
soldiers that's my problem so therefore
you are too hard so I'd ask you hit that
hard hitting them keep hitting them but
you know what Praveen the problem is it
we're also exactly maybe two weeks away
from announcement of next general exams
so I want to know what is it that can be
done a quantifiable clearly defined
military we enjoy telling us does that
exist if I was a politician which
thankfully I am NOT I take the generals
advice and let loose a drone strike a
few kilometers across the line of
where it will when here I disagree where
it will achieve absolutely big zero zero
people will blow up you will have a
couple of terrorists killed you will
have some politicians mainly will cheer
about it and three months later you will
have this happen again that's my problem
the problem isn't revenge this is not
why military strategy is made the
problem is what can you do to inflict on
Pakistan sufficient pain to deter it
with all respect we've been doing this
cross-border operations for 25 years not
to that scale what you are saying is
also rating Pakistan in today the
environment here also the environment of
day I am allowed to bring hot
economically if you HOT him in the world
over I am saying it you hurt them
economically you hurt rather hotter
sounds very nice our trade relationship
with Pakistan is hardly and it is hardly
anything if we don't have the economic
can remove it but it makes no difference
right it makes no difference either
remember that the minute you let a drone
strike across they will be retaliation
so be prepared for that also fine
the big problem is crafting a strategy
which can actually take out terrorist
leaders and significant value targets
and Pakistan's intelligence and military
service my cross the border covertly
developing that capacity takes us but he
wrote said and I've said this we've had
this debate in this studio for 15 years
now that is more than ability I talked
about since our current national
security adviser was in the Intelligence
Bureau in at the time of operation para
crime of ready attack on Parliament
sadly and I'm not disclosing any secrets
here look through Parliament questions
for that period and you'll discover that
our intelligence services have been
consistently under strength underfunded
with vacancies sanctioned at that time
still not one of mine is this week no
one have we don't have the tools we
don't have the strategy the only thing
we have is politicians
asking for blood of the other side
gentlemen thank you so much for joining
us on this edition of view point I'm
very very clear that you don't have a
strategy you will see a lot of loud
political talk maybe in the next 24 to
48
but every time you hear that loud
political talk ask yourself where is
this talk really going to lead you an
ear down the line two years down the
line unless you ask yourself that
question and unless we put pressure on
governments representatives to ask that
question I don't think we're gonna get
that

fHNgQ2mkydw,"Viewpoint | Subramanian Swamy Talks To CNN-News18, Denies Intelligence Failure In Pulawama Attacks",The attacks in Pulwama not only left the Nation in a bitter mood but also was a blow to the Government in tackling terrorism.,2019-02-14T18:18:45Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fHNgQ2mkydw/hqdefault.jpg,"let me welcome our first big guest on
the show tonight and let me get some
clarity on the story dr. subra of the
Swami joining us dr. Swamy welcome I've
been seeing your tweets dr. Swamy but
look at what we are now reporting sir
yes that this appears to be a
straightforward case of intelligence
failure would you agree with me would
you agree with me sir that this kind of
an episode unless there was intelligence
failure now I don't agree with you
why so I've been in government and I
have friends in the government even
today and I I've got no indication that
we were there was an intelligence
failure that there was no indication
whatsoever but they I would like you to
remember one thing that it's easy to
blame the intelligence failure but
that's ultimately what a passive thing
to prevent some event from happening but
they go on and on and coming as they say
we have to be lucky only once well the
Indians have to be lucky every time we
have to now have a policy what is our
policy we still have most favored nation
Clause of the WTO for the powerful
Pakistanis and it's of one way yes they
don't give it to us we give it to them
so why we have does nothing about the
white enemies what parties in because
there is war in power is alter you are
in power in the state of Jammu and
Kashmir till you decided that booba
Mufti was not working as per your
political convenience and then you
decided to snap your ties with her why
should these questions not be pays posed
against algebra tonight sir I I don't
make policy for my for my party
government they don't listen to any of
us they make their decisions themselves
and there is they go by a kind of a
conventional wisdom that we should
strive for peace with Pakistan we hear
that from our elite here we hear them
from the Luo Tian's crowd cricket we had
to put up such a massive fight to see
that we don't play cricket what about
the Indus Valley one thing which we
unilaterally gave to Pakistan we can
take it away any time there are so many
aspects the what's the need for an
embassy well it has no value at all that
those poor people there are living in
fright those people in the embassy
dr. Swamy please tell me why Telus
trikes happen dr. Swamy when the Mumbai
terror strikes happened this is exactly
what we were told then that UPA
government was an indecisive government
Manmohan Singh was one Mohan Singh it
was a weak government now you have a
full majority government sir you have a
political story which is unfolding on a
daily basis where your government is
supposed to be the most stable the most
decisive government the most decisive
government in this country cannot take
these decisions that you're asking me
that you're telling me about today dr.
Swamy you are more interested in finding
whether I give an a-plus to the in the
Modi government or a see - I'm not
concerned with that I am concerned with
the fact that every time I propose a
policy for Pakistan which is workable
all of you gang up and say I'm a war
monger I'm an extremist I am a Muslim
hater this kind of thing I am just
saying Pakistan is doing it with
impunity you have today a capacity of
over 2,000 drones provided to you by the
Israelis you can go and knock out that
fellow's claim the credit
JJ Mobile who gave Jesse Mohammed
freedom it was a watch by government but
you are all the praise for the humanity
of mr. Vajpayee the broad-mindedness
he's a man of your party so on he's a
part of you but a time for war he's a
part of your party watch I was yes yes
he he was a member of my party but so
was chamberland a member of this church
al was all the time would you would you
admit doctors what was a mistake it was
a mistake for your party to be in an
alliance with the PDP do you believe war
on terror do you believe the Kashmir
situation what you are you go and see
your own you're asking me go and see
your own videos from day one I said this
is the wrong thing that has happened and
that it should be broken up we had have
a defense minister giving on telephone a
clearance to register in a fire against
the army people you remember that yes
there was no there was no action on that
I am NOT going to here you couldn't
this question of which party is wrong
with which party is right I am going to
quote into the principle what we need to
do today so tell me give me two he needs
to do this so give me two options after
Sammy give me two options well there's a
well I have a boat
immediate action and a long-term action
first of all immediately we must break
diplomatic relations with Pakistan
we must cancel the most favored nation
clause and we should start now by in a
graduated way to take care of the Indus
water supply that's how we should start
and then we should use drones to go and
find where mr. Joshi Mohammed this and
kill him cannot capture him one of the
things has to be done okay and we have
to interact with the Chinese and the
Americans to see that they are on our
side all both of them have gone away
from us
can I ask because we have not understand
or anything so dr. Swamy can I ask you
in conclusion sir can I just ask you do
we really have a policy to deal with
Pakistan sir does this government have a
policy to deal with pockets not yet or
is Pakistan just Armenian political tool
for the BJP to beat every time there is
an election I don't think if we have any
method or a way of thinking about
Pakistan to think it as a tool it can
never be a tool it has made up black in
the face today how can you say that we
are using it as a tool because we don't
have a if you don't have a policy if you
don't have a policy then I'll I'm liable
to say this sir that every time
something happens that means Pakistan is
that now you can talk on both sides of
your mouth as they say in America you
you can't say that you are using
Pakistan as tool we have no policy on
Pakistan okay there is no structured
policy what is the structured policy all
right nobody's is ad hoc no so it's ad
hoc and no structured policy thanks very
much dr. Swamy for being blunt and
candid as you always have been at least
you have some clarity as to where a
particular member of the ruling Alliance
really stands

While the audio tape of Masoor ...,2019-02-14T17:08:53Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pSh59LNTlOs/hqdefault.jpg,"all right we've had a series of attacks
perhaps not in the last couple of years
od was the last big attack and that was
in 2016 but we've had good thus far with
that put on code and now this is the
worst and move T is slow confirming and
this is perhaps the worst attack that
we've seen in Kashmir in the last three
decades
what can India do what should India do

political commentator joining us from
Srinagar we're also hoping to be joined
by Sanjay Jha Praveen euro euro Kashmiri
expert you've seen many such attacks in
the past but the scale the audacity of
what we saw today I mean is it even
comparable to something that we've seen
in the past look this isn't the first
time that a Kashmiri resident has
carried out a suicide bombing a 17 year
old Srinagar resident did that back in
2000 it's a horrific attack but you've
had others in which 25 26 28 30 people
have been killed what's important is not
the horror of this what's important is
the context after Pathan coat and URI
surgical strikes you had Pakistan
clamping down on terrorism yeah but from
last year it reported the DJIA Muhammed
was being given an increasingly open
reign in privacy Imran Khan's ephemeral
counter-coup Naya Pakistan we'd carried
a large exclusive on this channel about
a new base they were building outside
Bahawalpur the point is that the rains
have been taken off the surgical strikes
in 2016 were intended to signal to
Pakistan they look if you cross a
certain threshold we're willing to cross
that line and hit you this takes us now
with this enormous strike on the eve of
an election into really unchartered
dangerous terrain why do you say that
will India feel compelled to respond
after this the argument for would
certainly be that you can't let
something of this scale go without a
retire
is the argument against would be this
time it's an ethnic Kashmiri who has not
trained in Pakistan who has done this
that the park that the high mountain
passes are covered with several feet of
snow still it's midwinter making a light
incursion across the LOC dangerous the
Pakistan Army will undoubtedly this time
have learned it's lessons from the past
and be waiting
maybe we should ratchet up the response
to another stage altogether but what
perhaps a missile strike on a jesh
facility without without troops action
without using but that takes us into
again very uncharted but but general
area I mean you know I don't want to
compare numbers because every fatal T
every single fatal T has a family has a
backstory and every single fatal T
should not have happened
but Yuri was seventeen soldiers this is
40 that's more than more than twice can
India can the government of India afford
to be seen as doing nothing
good evening czaka a very sad my
condolences to the families of the
bereaved soldiers who sacrificed the
extreme life of them there's in the
nation my my worries Sokka we've been
debating it for years almost two three
years on this you think it is going to
end
no the way we are handling Kashmir
militancy it is not going to end I have
been saying this it has got
multi-dimensional aspects to it you
can't handle it through security forces
you will keep having these security
breaches what we've seen today it has
happened in past it has happened now I
would say it is getting more emboldened
the militants or the terrorists are
getting used to such security activities
so they are getting more important they
are getting more innovate if they are
getting no stronger in their actions the
the degree of the attack today you know
an ie deal which was presumably you know
latched on to this suicide bomber
sitting inside an SUV ramming into a
convoy of about 8 P buses I think there
was 75 to 80 buses that's a great aspect
all together the SOP of moving a convoy
at that particular time in such a rush I
know three four days the
was closed there must have been a lot of
jams people returning from the 2500 CRPF
men moving coming back from leave for
the duty that's a different aspect to it
that's that I'm sure the security
agencies and the security forces will
look into this okay what is this are we
dealing it in correct manner as a nation
okay I'll come back to that I'll come
back to why why you believe we're not
dealing with this in the right fashion
but on the phone line right now I have

spank me again naturally public okay
such a pal Malik governor of Jammu and
Kashmir's thank you for speaking with us
let me now open this up to the rest of
our panelist in the rain Tunisia is here
Sanjay Jha and gorga Lonnie dr. Hubbard
Singh also of the PDP know Anthony job
we had re 17 of our soldiers died we had
the surgical strikes there were multiple
casualties and fatalities on the other
side and we were told that Pakistan will
not dare do this again and there was
there was admittedly there was a period
of lull for almost a year after that now
40 of our Germans have died sir that is
more than twice of the people okay who
were killed in owning what are we going
to do what is the Government of India
going to do sir
even a single life is important even a
single life is important the point is by
what the Pakistan has done today is
something that you know the entire
country at the entire country is this
angry and when the countries and the
people of the country you just go and
talk with ordinary people this solenoid
is so angry and and as they you just
heard the governor of Jammu and Kashmir
that's the mood of the government as
well that's the mood of the government
Pakistan will have to pay the price they
will have to pay the price we know that
being the you know the action of the
security forces have been very effective
as the governor also outlined in the
last year and on if you look at the
numbers 230 terrorists more than 230 for
a laminate eliminated now Pakistan is
getting frustrated they are getting
frustrated that's clearly shows but I
want to share one thing with you that we
are we the government government is
going to respond Pakistan will bear the
heat just wait it's not only the
government is the people of it they have
130 corridor people of India that's what
they want if the people want that the
government will have to actually our
condolences to their families I get
everything that you are saying but but
here is here is the bottom line on this
that surely a red line has been crossed
today just like a red line was crossed
in eure how are we going to raise the
cost for the enemy if you're saying
Pakistan is the enemy it is our
archrival they've created this policy of
bleeding India by a thousand cuts and
for the last 30 years Praveen it's been
working for them we haven't found a
response we haven't raised the cost
enough for them to not to dare do this
ever again and I frankly don't know what
that what that cost is not correct I
don't know what the answer they're not I
don't know what the answer to that
question is I honestly don't but I do
know this that war the decision to go to
war is the general will say ought not be
a question that is decided by public
clamor it's far too serious a business
and I'm sure right now there are the
highest levels of government people are
thinking this through this very soberly
the reason India didn't retaliate on
innumerable occasions in the past both
under NDA rule and under Congress rule
remember we didn't go to war even our
parliament or after 26/11 was because
our overarching strategic goal is to get
as close as possible to double-digit
economic growth as we can possibly get
if we want to stand up to China
somewhere in the future we need to go
down that track and wars are not very
good things if you're looking to do that
more surely there must be a solution so
people have discussed developing our
offensive covert capacity over the years
yeah the ability to take out terrorist
leaders on the other side to pay them
back in their own coin unfortunately
we're in a reality where after multiple
governments and multiple discussions on
this our intelligence services are still
starved of resources I am not disclosing
any confidential data here it's
parliamentary questions both the
external and internal intelligence
services have manpower deficits of over
30 percent our technological
intelligence is way beyond we're a
country of our scale and size should be
many of these things will take years if
not decades to address if we start today
no they're not quick fixes it's one
thing to take out high-value targets and
I agree with Ravine that that's got to
be one part of the strategy to to to
send out a message to the enemy country
that look this is not on there is a
price to pay but strategically there's
got to be a price to pay a cost to pay I
mean I know it sounds simplistic but if
this were Israel they would have made a
heavy price for the other side to pay
and they as they have in the last 30
years we have done all kinds of things
from surgical strikes to cross border
cross border hits moat are shelling with
we've tried everything but somehow it
still doesn't seem to be high enough for
the enemy to get the message Sanjay Jha
Sacco let me tell you I think first and
foremost a terrible tragedy I think it's
is a day of mourning for all of us in
India 40 people dying and the numbers
may escalate soldiers I mean there
cannot be anything more horrible than
that is it depressing it's dismal
it's sad you know what is the reality
the reality is that as I think somebody
mentioned on your panel that you know
both our countries have a very
conventional track record of a very
hostile relationship
it's a blow hot blow cold sporadic
affection followed by a terror attack
Prime Minister Modi leads up in Lahore
and we know exactly what happened
thereafter so the fact is that one at
one point we need to be very clear you
have a cross-border neighbor with very
inimical intentions they still are very
very you know convinced in their belief
that Kashmir is an issue for them every
prime minister says that including Imran
Khan the truth is we need to strengthen
our own security what can we do what we
can do is to strengthen our security
make sure that our intelligence is
foolproof
you can't afford to have a security
breach you know it's very easy to use
these terms security breach but 40
people are dead today I mean these are
the soldiers who have a job to do who
have been slaughtered in cold blood the
other part also remains that this is
critical I don't want to bring it up no
politics in it during the time of such
national grief but you know you can't
live in denial no I
you know the surgical strike everybody
said it was a very great military
endeavor but to make it appear as if
that is the end of the entire you know
you know the hostility with Pakistan
Pakistan can no longer attack us it is
frankly preposterous I mean look at the
numbers actually the number of attacks
in in against our security forces where
even civilians have been casualties are
alarmingly high I have the numbers I
don't want to talk about them today the
other part remains that there is no you
know silver bullet it is the surgical
strike is not a silver bullet so the
truth is that if you begin to you know
create an air of complacency and you
know try and make a political capital
out of things like this
everyone stinks to become you know a
little complacent that you know we have
done it we have sinned I don't think
there is a silver bullet that will solve
this problem but Shirley and I get both
her books saying as well as going on
into the debate but but but general area
there's got to be a price to pay
I mean you had the governor saying we're
not a banana republic but if we don't
respond and if we don't raise the cost
for the other side well the world will
look at us and say that we are a banana
republic 40 of our soldiers are dead we
what are they going to tell their
families zakah absolutely correct they
got to be a way to make it costly for
the nation which is perpetuating this
doubt the type of militancy in the
valley but tell me is the Pakistan only
angle in this this boy was born in
Indian soil raised in Indian soil how
did he join them have you addressed this
problem for last 20 years he was 17
years old 18 years old no but how do you
have a rail habló unique to it I mean I
I can't debate this on the TV channel no
you would need to please ask the people
who are living there in the valley has
any sir punch died
as any politician died has any
politician son died why why only
uniformed soldiers are dying because you
have left it only one angle for the
security forces to deal with the
situation which is not totally a sad
boxing is the is the spokesperson of the
PDP and and and the magician is probably
right I mean I know some punches have
died but certainly certainly
I know politicians have died no families
it is back on anniversary of a observe
guru and raising that seven years old
issue no tell me tell me dr. hotboxing
how do you expect no matter how mighty
the state is and no matter how mighty
your armies are it is on how do you know
no no it's not unfortunate it is it is
happen by design where there are
and unfortunately a litter king of the
values who have been compounding this
some core of our heart who have been
more visits breed who have a soft corner
saltier know people like a dilemma they
are over soon
how do you explain now please once again
you you speak for a Kashmiri based party
pleasing only into a viewers watching
lizardy rogram across the country are
never how is it we're certainly in
eighteen twenty year old killed we would
never this fellow's not gone deep on the
Everest
so how has he become such a cold-blooded
killer that he's killed 40 of our Jevons
he's a Kashmiri born in Kashmir raised
in Kashmir
probably never went to went to Pakistan
even once we get from we are pressing it
from so many times from the from the era
we started the PDP move to serve and we
people are pressing for the dialogue we
are telling key this is the only
situation only solution of the problem
he will stop know exactly when may move
he goes one second once again when they
remove T goes to the funerals of local
militants once again when mayor booba
Mufti goes to the funerals of local
militants what sort of message do you
think it sends out to young boys like
this this this fellow this are the
lament what message does it send does it
not send a message that one of the
foremost politicians of Kashmir is
standing with this kind of militancy
he's standing with this kind of violent
means to solve whatever grievance no we
never use it the militancy we never
stand with the militancy so why did we
go and go go to hold his funerals of
local militants why does she do that
just last week she had gone no no no you
are you are you are you are you are
wrong sir you are wrong sir that that is
that is not the this time we don't talk
politics on the blood of soldiers this
is
so it city in the aftermath of the
attacks it's a variant for you right
thing to time to that you don't know
politics and then my week slinky new
your leader shows up elevations field go
through the his gargle Ani
sir night not know history night how
many night I want IO and exciting
minutes a rational logical explanation
if you can go her Golani okay as to why
a seventeen-year-old or an
eighteen-year-old would pick up the gun
or in this case strap himself onto an
improvised explosive device RAM and SUV
which kills forty Jevons I mean you know
partly agree with what mr. Praveen Swami
said and also I know partly with what
the other gentleman from the PDP that
you know about dialogue but you know
specifically coming to your question to
explain the context I think the context
is there in the video if you have
listened to the video of this guy who
has you know you know you know kind of
being responsible for this attack you
know the Kashmir has been receiving body
bags for the last thirty years so the
context of Kashmir is very different and
you know it's it's not time to count
body bags and you know all human lives
are precious every one every single
human being on either side of the divide
on either side of the ideal that you can
divide whether it's strong you know it's
a soldier from India or it's very young
you know fathers in Kashmir that there
are funerals on a daily basis if you go
and travel south which mean there are
all five six ten hundreds on it on a
daily basis so that kind of the kind of
the atmosphere the kind of the context
that occasionally boy living in north
Kashmir south Kashmir and said to
Kashmir is very different it is it is in
violence so the answer to that is not
picking up the gun you know in terms
knees 14 soldiers are going home in body
bags no no no let me let me let me
explain so you know value that you also
talked about the grievances or the
political aspirations that Kashmir is
have so the ultimate you know thing is
that there has to be a dialogue because
this cannot go
you cannot have something or explain
what happens how is your nail into a
dialogue tell me how will what happened
today leads to I die you know mr.
governor mr. Sethi pol receptacle Malik
say that innovate will wipe out of
Pakistan from the map these are this is
rhetoric you know Pakistan is not as any
Municipal Corporation that fights
genocide simple questions are these
how will they attack on Iran the CRPF
party today killing 40 of our soldiers
how please explain how will that bring
the Indian state to the dialogue table -
you know what what I will tell you there
is a book by Praveen Soni a co-authored
by Casanova ha and it's named as dragon
on doorsteps
the first line of that book is that for
dead China India cannot win a war
against Pakistan so you know it's not
time to have rhetorical utterances
because that is not the point the point
is no you are you are not helping your
case I'm saying because there is no
political because there is the absence
of I mean once again once again goal one
one thing that's in the video depressing
to me in that video gaha refers to yeah
is that this kid is not only talking
about Kashmir he talks about a pan India
Islamic war which will continue until
Hassan is read again from the minarets
of the Babri Masjid
about a thousand Lions rising across
India whatever whatever whatever this is
the stuff of man
of global jihadi polemics but this does
speak of a deep political failure God's
right I mean the Indian government is
guilty of all kinds of failures but the
sword cuts to waste because politicians
within Kashmir
both secessionist and as well through
India as well as well as the mainstream
guys have been utterly irresponsible in
dealing with this and with this
generation that has had to live through
30 years of hardship and has reacted to
it in various ways ways now we ought not
forget that today and I think it's
important to underline this a few young
people are joining these jihadist groups
20 years ago people were flocking in
their thousands to do it right the death
toll was far far higher what politics
has dismally failed to do is to reach
out to this relatively small section of
young people who feel disenfranchised
and frustrated saying engage yourself in
politics there is an answer there is a
way forward all we have instead is this
language of the gun and the general is
perfectly right there are things armies
and all these forces are exceptionally
good at they've shown that over the last
year the governor's right they've
eliminated record numbers of terrorists
all these young people who have gone and
joined up are dead today bar a handful
but this can go on till the cows come
home you'll kill 50 people there'll be
another 50 people the world has wrong
political engagements this the sad thing
is the government can't do it alone the
political engagement that you talk about
and and and general areas here when
Bowron ronnie was killed right I don't
know 10 20 30 40 thousand people turned
up at his yes at his funeral how does a
Kashmiri politician who is faced with
this reality at the grassroots engage
with young people who are seeing this
this mad frenzy and are driven by this
mad frenzy they call themselves Patriots
let one or two of them get killed by
this mob when they speak about the
nation so you are saying it's yes that
that for actually to sacrifice notch out
to the better price to favor
they need time is they need to reach out
to the grassroot level why should you
suffer be killed some of them will be
stoned somehow some of them will be
let's all let those crowd of 20,000
phase 20,000 bullets you have two
answers as a citizen of the country we
need to choose we had to have a strategy
okay you want to put 20,000 soldier to a
20,000 population or you want to put 20
politicians to 20,000 one population if
I may just add very quickly to that in
2010 you had these terrible disturbance
yeah but after that you had an election
record numbers of people participated in
those elections in the hope people risk
their lives and plenty of them died in
the hope you would get some decent
governance that reached out to a younger
generation with all kinds of problems
problems of brutalization unemployment
disenfranchisement the brain what
happened nothing happened I was in the
most peaceful here we tried our best
yeah but there was nobody to take over
from us and that's where politicians in
Kashmir need to take some accountability
- I am that goes for separatist I want
to play out since we're talking about
politicians we're on the subject of
politicians and how there's a complete
vacuum there I want to speak to what who
is arguably one of the foremost Kashmiri
politicians dr. Jatin they're saying
he's the mos in the PMO I remember my
colleague has spoken to him just a short
while back let's listen in to what he
said
new party has tried everything you've
withdrawn support from the PDP
government whom you now accuse of being
an apologist for all those anti national
forces you send governess at the pol
Malik you've tried reaching out Prime
Minister himself has gone recent times
but nothing seems to be working there as
far as getting the terrorists you know
getting these people to stop supporting
terrorists in Kashmir no I think also
because let's not forget that this is a
deep concept DC has to cross the border
so this is a sponsored terrorism as I
mean say this is it and unfortunately it
is developed a vested interest even
within India Pakistan you're blaming for
today's attack I am blaming Pakistan
sponsored agencies whether they be like
[ __ ] or what but at the same time I'm
also blaming those whom you are not
feeling you are feeling shy to blame the
elements within India within Kashmir who
are developed a vested interest in the
continuation of this militancy what now
so we've seen the Prime Minister tweet
Arun Jaitley GVK sing generally kissing
they've all said that the sacrifice of
these martyrs will not go in vain when
you say will not go in vain what exactly
is the government no I am NOT here to
define that that's for the effects what
is the defense ministry and certainly
this is not be in the public domain that
I am so and I don't wish to speak out or
turn on this security madam but I think
we have every reason to trust to believe
in when from the highest echelons it is
said that this will be availed I am in
fact walking one step further to say
that also avenge those those this is a
unique example in the entire world
nowhere even the most developed
democracies of the world whether it be
United Sarah United my kingdom you don't
find a cur politicians ministers tending
to be apologetic about terrorism does
not affect the morale of the CRPF
Germans who saw their own colleagues
getting butchered not even getting a
chance to defend themselves certainly
but at the same time the entire India
stands behind them I think the more harm
to their morale is done when one of
their own ministers their political
functionaries whom they guard day and
night and protect them from terror
attacks if those who have hesitation in
calling a terror a terror attack if they
have the courage or the courage of
condition why should they first give up
their own security
the same CRPF personals are guarding all
these Kashmiri politicians before I let
you go not as a minister not as a Member
of Parliament but because you're a
resident of that state what do you think
our Kashmiri and people from Jammu and
Ladakh wanting in terms of avenging what
has happened to
I'll tell you very frankly and because
you said that I should be speaking as
far as people of Jammu Ladakh is
concerned they are very clear about it
they have no compromise on their
nationalistic commitment but even the
people living in cash we'd the common
man is walking the streets of City Nagar
particularly the common youth is fed up
of this and if you because they but they
are scared of talking maybe as frankly
or as as outwardly as somebody in Jammu
Ladakh would do for because there's a
wheel of fear once the wheel of here
goes up because the youth of Kashmir
this is a post 95 generation now English
me they are highly aspirational they
want to move ahead in the development
journey led by Prime Minister Modi and
this is an attempt to tour that
so you have the MOS PMO and and he's
been the only minister who's come out
and spoken on record he's spoken to my
colleague Nima their indonesia is saying
that there will be a price to pay the
prime minister's also said that the
sacrifice of our Jevons will not go in
vain but i think you know we are just
going through the same cycle over and
over again we did this when petanque
what happened we did this when only
happen we've done this all the way back
to the Parliament attack and operation
for Akram I mean we can't be stuck in
the same cycle is this question to me
yeah yeah mrs. Aneeta yeah yeah okay you
know well not not exactly I don't think
that you're I wouldn't agree with you
you see we need to focus on on Pakistan
pocket because it's bid out Pakistan and
without Pakistan's its full support you
know all you know this is not possible
we all know that so it's important that
we are clear in terms of who exactly is
our enemy so if you are clear why don't
you just call on problematic guys with
the hottest on collar dhaka recall the
High Commissioners shut down the
missions call it off
snap ties listen listen listen
let me let me speak allow me at least
once on tense okay I've been listening
to you for the last 30 minutes okay
please your those who know diplomacy and
you know it very well you you know you
know these things very well point is
that you know look at what we have
managed to do you know against Pakistan
the last five years Pakistan is
literally on its knees you can contest
people can play politics on that I don't
today I'm just keeping quiet because you
know it's not the really day I didn't
want to get into any to to maybe anybody
you know the point here is that we need
to address the Pakistan enemy the
country the force behind all this second
is radicalization radicalization is the
reality and why did we allow this
ridiculous Asian to happen the last 20
years it has happened radicalization 17
a young man you can say that but who is
behind it who has radicalized them you
know one who allowed that may I may I
just point this out
while reading this thing mentions this
and mr. Taneja mentions this that
Pakistan is the is the real target that
we need to go after Iran Khan is not
even put out a tweet condemning the
attack would you expect him to I mean
Praveen it will be too much to expect
him to why why on earth would he do it I
mean Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif reached
out the hand of friendship he tried to
act after Pathan coat and he paid a
terrible price for it
the gesture Mohammed or the
lashkar-e-taiba are not some sort of you
know independent entities acting on
their own wheat a tweet condemning what
happened 40 Jevons died you know if you
make enough of a fuss about it I'm sure
he went when Peshawar happened I I
clearly remember the Prime Minister
spoke to the Russia even tighter and and
how how does that matter
Imran Khan is in office because the
dregs of the Pakistani jihadist movement
supported his campaign he knows that you
know Nass he knows that the gesture
moment is a branch office for the is I
mean is basically you know these guys
with a little badge around their so
basically you know watch what you're
telling us and what general area is
telling us is that waste basically stuck
with a range of bad options on ginger
we're stuck with a range of bad options
and we're going to be in the cycle czaka
know I think there are two points here
Jaco there are two points here you if
you have a strategy that is usually
enduring if you have a tactical approach
that is you know blow hot blow cold you
know it is very sporadic intermittent
the fact is and this is the elephant in
the room that we need to bite today it's
a sad day it's a day of mourning but we
can't ignore that reality because you'll
have to address it tomorrow you can't
delay that procrastinate by comparison
the truth is we have had no cash made
policy till today I'll tell you this
government you know this must be you you
you in fact with with the PDP and did
you have a Kashmiri policy because it
never did know I'm I'm talk
well well let me tell you what has
happened here you had an opportunity
opportunistic alliance they are
ideologically in my opinion totally
incompatible and during the time that
they were together they spoke in
different voices now there is enough
data to tell you that militancy has been
on the rise even if it is lesser than
before it is a big strain and now it's
you're talking about it assuming a very
monstrous today you know the real
problem is this and general aria Praveen
weigh in on this and I'll get to are
Kashmiri guests as well over the years
and I and I and I say this with a grade
of 99 I you know that I know that local
politician I will I will I will mr. mr.
mr. Taneja if you can give me a solution
friends problem I'll give you one hour
of air time please give me a solution to
this problem I don't think any of us
have because because I think the people
of this country are sick and tired of
like this cycle of violence we need to
put it over to violence so if if you
need to put an end to this violence then
we are with you we cannot go ahead you
can we cannot be losing soldier after
soldier attack after attack and then
come back and be stuck in the same cycle
of violence
listen to beta general area I just want
to make one point to my both the
raclette one in each week and then
giving whatever calm that was there in
the power in the last 30 years did we
have a continual strategy to handle it
if we had it we wouldn't have been gone
back to was why number one yeah
Praveen just spoke on a one of the
strategy of picking up a high-value
targets across the border yeah what
about the high-value targets in homeland
did we have any of the government
courage to pick up any one of them yeah
did we silence any of the speakers in
Kashmir yeah any of the loudspeakers
from where these I have heard those loud
speakers myself we may have gone and
reported about this loud speaking to the
authorities
no Authority ever had a courage to shut
those loudspeakers who this is this
radiation
today we will shouting it security
forces have been shorting it over their
head for last 10 years who please look
into this please do this who gave space
to the likes of a cyber legal ani or
automated voice the the most that any
government and I'm not saying this
government of the previous government is
most of the any government any guys do
is to put them in house arrest as if
that will solve the problem
our boxing when you are in power that's
what you did when you over I was were in
power that's all that's all they've also
covert of India don't have sir going top
India don't have and he can create
policy regarding the winning of hearts
of Kashmir Kashmiri people and emotions
of the Kashmiri people they only talk
then they there is a incident they made
so many committees and so many so many
people come to Kashmir give their
reports but not a single report has been
taken seriously what you are a power up
early a few months ago politicians you
are into all for three years this bull
tell me what are your please tell me
what did your government do to ends
against the likes of a side illegal on e
or the likes of or all of who is
appointed them surely they've not
contested elections surely they're not
there are a dear there is a sentiment in
the Kashmiri
yes so who are pointing the likes of mr.
Geelani or mr. virus in the fish makes
this so-called larger sentiment of
Kashmir they they are also stakeholders
of the stakeholders of the Jammu and
Kashmir you must have seen less it is a
big problem
are you a stakeholder or on a stake hold
here there was a deal was a there was a
common min there was I joined up in like
I'm sorry I'm sorry mr. Singh but I find
this profoundly disingenuous and
dishonest watch it one sec once again
once again no this is simply untrue
people have talked
there were negotiations with the first
India government they went nowhere I
mean remember George Fernandes trying to
have a meeting with Syed Ali Shigella
there were negotiations under the both
UPA government's in secret and in public
they went nowhere why did they go
nowhere now you can talk to the people
concerned and they'll say the horrea
didn't keep its promises you can talk to
the hariette and they'll say Oh Delhi
didn't keep some promises but the truth
is nobody was willing to expend
political the political capital it
needed and nobody was willing to take
the risks that it needed today when you
say talk to the hariette what is the
problem
Delhi sent interlocutor after Internet
the hariette doesn't want to talk to mr.
Geelani refuses to talk to anyone and
okay let me say also there is wise
because the who yet today this ageing
Geron to critique readership when a
municipality seat yeah there's a whole
new generation out there who speak a
different language who are angry for
reasons justified or unjustified is the
next question but the political
leadership in Kashmir needs to ask
itself what it's doing I mean what mr.
Harbach saying is basically saying is
that you know I am going to lead Kush me
I'm elected I am the Chief Minister
now Kashmir has all these burning
problems but you know what let Delhi
deal with games all those burning Rob I
just take my ten percent on all the road
construction contracts and everything
else that comes along all the hard work
someone else what's happened all right I
got a wrap-up god I'll give you 30
seconds to wrap up because I you know
this is this has been going on for the
last thirty years at least you've got
these self-appointed so called as mr.
Singh says they represent the sentiment
if they represent the sentiment then
what are the likes of Mehbooba Mufti and
Omar Abdullah doing there absolutely I
mean you know Mufti and Homer Abdullah
despite winning elections you know and
getting elected through electoral
politics are seen largely as Delhi's
agents in Kashmir and that's the reality
on the ground and you know if you talk
about psychology Lonnie he has won
election three times he has won a
hat-trick of elections so don't don't
say that they do not know represent the
sentiment so there are there is a there
is a representation beyond the electron
electoral politics in Kashmir and
unless you talk to them nothing will
change on the ground and that is the
harsh reality so why do I have to mr.
Sharma when he came he was the buoy he
was behaving there last year it's also
you know you have to go back at food you
have to see there is a reason to this
rage there is a reason to this rage and
you have to understand that reason and
the context of that and that lies in the
70 year old dispute and the last 30
years is another context which you know
video Edward he's dead I don't think any
of those conceive of the issues that you
are talking about I mean if you are
going to build this if you have this you
know misguided completely you know
completely warped idea of making an
Islamic state here in India and that's
why you've gone and killed yourself that
is the video I'm just referring to the
video that this this young man put out
before he decided to do what he did I'm
gonna wrap up thank you thank you thank
you thank you thank you wrap up I'm done
and I and I keep saying this I do not
want to do another show where another
bunch of Germans have been killed
another worry has happened or another
Pathan code has happened but I'm afraid
the reality is and we've seen this for
far too long the reality is that this
has happened in 2001-2002 this is happen
in two thousand four five ten eleven and
it will continue to happen and I don't
think any political establishment either
in Delhi or in Srinagar has the
political capital as Praveen said or
he's invested enough to find the way out
of this vicious cycle of violence

Cyrus talks to an alleged Air Force Pilot to understand Rafale deal from the Air Forces point of ...,2019-02-14T14:00:16Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zC0yc7DeWdg/hqdefault.jpg,"now let's look at the file deal from the
air force point of view a CAG report was
tabled in Parliament which Parliament
ignored comparing there are five deals
negotiated by the UPA against the deal
negotiated by the NDA now it's so
appears that the Modi government's
agreement filed electrons is actually
two point eight six percent cheaper than
the deal negotiated by the previous UPA
so where does that leave us now let's
talk to someone who is in the middle of
all this for whom this really matters a
member of the Air Force joining us now
is the alleged spokesperson for the
Indian Air Force cadet honey singh all
right all right
good day I would like to interject that
good-b is actually a biscuit as you can
see that's my diet normally but what an
interesting name you have cadet honey
singh ji i am named after famous singer
yo yo honey singh ur older than him
talking to the name anyway is it because
you sing like him that they call you
this no because he is always flying high
we do know this Hodja no we do follow
this signal haha we do pelo of this
Hodja no better pilot than singer if I
may ask you look a bit old to be a cadet
mean you should have made perhaps flight
lesson and squadron leader by now I
agree sir but in the Air Force we have a
bit of a problem what problem promotions
are not happening fast enough so and why
is that so so normally a car did become
a flying officer or a flight left in and
after 2 years of flying sir okay and a
squadron leader take 6 years of flying 6
years so then what's the problem
flying what's the problem the flying
we're missing a very important
requirement for flying
what is this requirement is it training
no then what a plane
a plane yes we are waiting for planes
but how can India fight without planes
it's okay sir
India we don't fight with plates we
don't fight with planes we fight over
plates to share you mean the holder
filed on the BJP issue so what is gonna
happen now the Indian Air Force has
decided it is already looking to buy
planes from Russia so you're looking at
Russian manufacturers now no not Russian
manufacturers in Russian junkyard for
thickening 40 year old planes cheap
deals like you unnecessary cheap I am
need to point it out on national
television go on go on
that is all we can afford I feel really
sorry to hear this really sorry no no
don't worry if we don't find the planes
in Russia we will find all planes
somewhere else where on OLX and quicker
excellent good thought but you know I
need a phone actually second hand phone
also maybe I should talk to you offline
after some time and this is the has to
be a political solution for this what do
you think the government should do
according to me Rahul Gandhi and Luigi
should stop interfering in buying planes
why we need someone qualified and who do
you think should deal with this there is
only one person who is qualified to deal
with planes who deputy chief minister of
Rajasthan who such in pilot because he
is the only real pilot right right even
his father was a pilot I didn't go with
dr. Vijay Mallya good idea but the
problem with Vijay Mallya is that the
flight takes off but never returns
- but you've always travel in style even
if it's one-way travel in style that's
important - nah

shakeela and the big story we are
putting the spotlight on today is one
that is only intensifying and it's going
to intensify further as we get closer to
the all-important looks at by-elections
in 60 days from now allegations and
counter allegations are flying thick and
fast between the Congress and the BJP as
default politics explodes Rahul Gandhi
today launched again a fresh offensive
against the Prime Minister accusing him
now of being a middleman in the Rafal
deal but Rahul Gandhi did not stop at
that he went ahead and called the CAG as
Chaka DARS
Auditor General the CAG report remember
was supposed to be tabled in Parliament
today it may be tabled tomorrow but it
wasn't done today officials working with
the CAG report have told CNN news 18
that a copy of the report is with the
president and four copies are with the
Finance Ministry the report will be sent
to the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha
after being sanctioned by the president
so tonight on face off the question that
I'm asking is if Rahul Gandhi and has
Rahul Gandhi really crossed the line
with his middleman charge against Prime
Minister Narendra Modi let's take you
through the six big charges that
Congress president Rahul Gandhi made
today in his new Rafal offensive it was
based on an email purportedly by Airbus
officials quoting Christoph Solomon who
is he an adviser of lead Rhian now who
is he who was then the defense minister
in France one of the recipients of this
mail is somebody called Tom Enders he is
in fact the CEO of Airbus so the first
charge that has been leveled by Rahul
Gandhi against Prime Minister Narendra
Modi is that he is saying Prime Minister
Modi is acting as an ill Ambani's
middleman so perhaps the the the
strongest charge ever so far that we are
seeing from Rahul Gandhi
remember in that Airbus email shared by
the Congress president Saleh Minh says
that anil ambani had a confidential
meeting with laid rien asked for the
email Amani wanted to work with with the
company for defence helicopter
settlement in fact mentions Emma u
preparations in fact he goes on to say
and the intention to sign it
during the Prime Minister's visit charge
- Anil Ambani mentioned an MoU he was
looking forward to signing this is what
he what Rahul Gandhi has said and soon
after Prime Minister went to France how
did an alum money know of deal ten days
before the announcement is what Rahul
Gandhi is alleging Prime Minister he
says is doing what spies do he has
compromised on national security those
are again a very very strong charge
being levelled by Rahul Gandhi against
Prime Minister then he says the Prime
Minister Modi violated Official Secrets
Act
Prime Minister Modi remember announced
the deal to buy the Rafal fighters on
April 10th two weeks after this meeting
took place and in fact the sixth charge
is that the CAG report is worthless its
chalky dodd or deter general report but
let's not forget just few weeks back in
fact few months back the Congress was
putting pressure on the CAG asking them
to expedite the entire investigation
into the Rafal deal and submit its
report at the earliest and now before
the report is in public domain before
the rape report has been tabled the
Congress president has preempted the
Congress party has preempted the report
and said that and dismissed it
completely Brow's latest allegations
have sparked a political storm listening
to all the reactions that have come in
today
the dancer motive
onion imbalances middleman the transfer
the AG report is a worthless report in
fact I would term it as a chocolate
Auditor General
he is quoting from an email of Airbus he
is acting as a lobbyist for competitive
companies
[Applause]
and joining me now is senior BJP leader
and law and IT Minister Ravi Shankar
Prasad he was leading the government
charge in Parliament today mr. Prasad
thanks so much for your time here sir
you have accused Congress president
Rahul Gandhi you're working as a
lobbyist of foreign companies this is a
serious charge what evidence do you have
to back your claim first of all I take a
very strong objection that you counted
all the allegations of Rahul Gandhi on
prime time I had held a press conference
you just give 1/2 a sentence to me are
you being fair so we ran it's the most
wildest abusive please just now I am
asking I am hearing all your if you
don't want me on the channel I will
quietly withdraw please go ahead sir
well at least I want yourself to be fair
you just recounted all the allegations
of Rahul Gandhi one by one and then gave
him the space calling my leader a broker
of Anil Ambani and my very conclusive
elaborate rebuttal was completely
dismissive of it I take a strong offense
to it and it is very unfair to the part
of cnn-ibn and least expected from you
now listen to me Rahul Gandhi has been
shameless today irresponsible how did he
get the email of Airbus Airbus is under
cloud because of the deal of supplier
supply of aircraft in the previous UPA
regime
there are serious allegations
investigation by IDI including in public
domain of sending money to the bank
account of --until VAR therefore Rahul
Gandhi getting emails of Airbus which is
under cloud I would straightaway say it
is for helicopter okay
and it was internal document and based
upon that this responsible leader has
activated to call my leader a broker mr.
Rahul Gandhi's whole Condon has been
littered with a loot of the country from
Bofors to others he's himself on bail so
his mother on loot of public money and
sharing natural adult and property his
brother-in-law is suffering
investigation including with his mother
for dude of thousands of crores that is
the record of mr. role Gandhi and I want
to tell you very clearly on your channel
regardless of all the campaigns of carry
money he undertakes we shall expand with
the air force of India because Rahul
Gandhi is playing in the hands of the
enemies of India who don't want India
therefore to be strengthened the third
thing I would tell you and that is very
important every time Rahul Gandhi has
been proved to be false he ultimately
denied the charge that he talked to me
some more hot Parrikar about Rafael when
he protested he said the same thing
about French president in the house and
when French government controverted he
had no face mr. Franco Allah issued a
public statement denying his charge
they were Rahul Gandhi will keep on
playing fact after fact and make
allegations against us sir we will
export mr. Rahul Gandhi before the
people of the India he has been around
Rahul Gandhi claimed that Anil Ambani
visited then French defense minister
jean-yves le drian office and mentioned
an MoU in preparation and the intention
to sign during the Prime Minister's
visit of France
how come a private individual knew in
advance about the MOU who is saying this
it is not an official statement by the
Defense Minister of France it is the
competitive competition of Airbus saying
so the internal email I believe mr. Anil
Ambani has explained today publicly and
it is also about a helicopter deal Rahul
Gandhi is so much lack of knowledge he
does not understand difference between
air to aircraft fighter aircraft and
helicopters but that is beside the point
Rahul Gandhi is taking at the gospel
truth of internal email of Airbus
company under cloud because of serious
charges of impropriety including sending
money to a middleman was only brought by
the guts of Narendra Modi Wichita loire
in the Singapore bank account those are
well known Rahul Gandhi is an la-based
and I am Telling You repeatedly Rahul
Gandhi wants to frustrate this whole
deal because he is the doing the bidding
because of his own connections he went
to Europe is it not affect a lot of
lobbying is going on the country for all
those who lost it mr. Prasad we have
seen then the Congress president hopping
from one news report to another just to
corner the BJP government under file
issue
don't you feel this is helping the
Congress president in am aligning the
image of the government because the a
Modi papers that are being leaked are
contradicting the government's stand not
the least half-baked truth how page
files which are explained immediately
can we believe that the president of the
Congress party supposed to be the part
of a good dynasty will be so unabashed
shameless in producing untruth yesterday
he again said that that no sovereign
guarantee does he know Clause 4 of the
agreement clearly says if supply is not
met the government of France will ensure
the payment that is the agreement
between head of the government and head
of government which is legal in terms of
and as far as mr. money is concerned the
head of Rafael has clearly stated that
in the offset Clause he is being given
800 crores or a 30,000 car or we can be
given 200 other companies including
Maharaja
mr. Rahul Gandhi is playing with
employment potential of generation of a
large number of spare parts in India
therefore let me say one thing more on
your channel and I would like you to
give me a come time for that whole of
Rafael deal was kept pending for 10
years into 1213 Rafael become the lowest
tender they accepted that and again kept
on hold because the con of mr. Gandhi
cannot survive without any Commission
you know it very well we have said
publicly but madam let me tell you Maria
shaquille regardless of the very dubious
corrupt record of his family we have
never called them - no he today what he
has told my leader impeccable record mr.
Rahul Gandhi on your channel I am
Telling You will expose you before the
entire country and leave a side v
getting cornered we will coordinate with
Rahul Gandhi a family which is look at
public money is out to do the bidding of
forces inimical to our country's
interest sir intern with the Air Force
well expose their lobbying tendency mr.
Prasad you know if thank you anything
for them so just one just few more
questions Congress president clearly
according to you is indulging in shoot
and scoot ultimately it's hurting the
image of the BJP when you say you will
expose the lies of Rahul Gandhi when
will you do so it is showing it is
showing mr. Rahul Gandhi had
irresponsible as shameless and demeaning
the office he holds and also
compromising the legacy he claimed to
represent okay many experts are clearly
arguing that this rofl debate is
political mudslinging exercise and
nothing to do with facts and reality of
the matter do you do I also of the
similar opinion and if that is the fact
then why is BJP afraid of replying to it
politically we have already done so two
and a half hours nebula replied the PM
said I have held so many press
conferences in which you are also
present
so many blogs are only spoke in the Lok
Sabha what more do you wanted me but we
could never expect that the grandson of
Indira Gandhi the great-grandson of
Giovanna LaRue the son of Rajiv Gandhi
will be so economical with facts will
speak falsehood in the most shameless
manner and keep on repeating and
repeating even after Supreme Court has
erected everything after hearing air
force purely said there is no commercial
vested interest okay do you see us yet
to be presented just a just a minute and
today here is called already debunked it
when his party was saying she'll be
examined therefore Rahul Gandhi is
comforted but only when the report is in
his favor remember it burns the a report
on 2g oh no college scam on Commonwealth
that's what the whole thing is about
okay would you see this as Congress's
tit for tat as a Robert Vadra is being
investigated yes you are right because
he has no justification be very clear
about it and all these things will be
debated today Raj darts and robbed are
coming back to India he is talking of
official secret acts do I need to tell
you as to how much Michelle mama was
given access to cabinet notes do we need
to explain that it is government suffer
official Security Act violation come on
therefore we are very proud of the ramos
is impeccable record of honesty and he
will extend the fight against corruption
and mr. Rahul Gandhi feels but by making
this falsehood the pressure on his
brother-in-law would be eased
mr. Gandhi you are mistaken it is not in
the Modi government we don't bow down
before these types of Kalama knee are
you feeling pressure and do you have
this feeling mr. Prasad that as far as
the perception battle under file is
concerned
BJP is perhaps losing it not the least
the people of India trust us in terms of
commitment in terms of upholding the
majesty of India's forces in terms of
standing for the security of India
and they know the record of Congress
party an entire Condon that the way they
have looted I want to make it very clear
under Congress regime there can be no
arms deal on this delayed deal
impeccable record are shown and why
Wolcott rocky mama allowed to flee in
the Bofors case let me ask a question to
you one day please have a long debate on
arms deal will expose everything what
about the whole submarine deal you know
it very well with the other difference
didn't know it very well
what about August of a study or know it
very well there were all these things
are in public domain here we are upfront
country needs Rafael because Indian Air
Force need lethal power and why 36
aircraft because one regiment is 18
aircraft ok last question the supreme
could also said that last you have
standby that last question sir Boyd the
Congress party has said very clearly
that they do not believe in what the
supreme court has said they have already
preempted the CAG report and debunk did
now what next if they are dismissing
every investigation or any any
institution that is looking into it they
are in fact questioning that very
institution then how will you handle
this
that's very interesting they are making
education stuff lowering the dignity of
against us they don't believe Supreme
Court they don't believe CAG they don't
believe Election Commission they don't
believe CVC anyone who is willing to do
the bidding of mr. Rahul Gandhi his
family interest his corruption is okay
Rahul Gandhi maintained his tonic
silence as far as the entire loot of
smaller investors in Bengal is concerned
Rose Valley Chardonnay da that is quite
evident therefore all these things will
be exposed but yes today I am very
pained to say that let me repeat we had
bitter differences we had serious
reservations about impropriety and
corruption of the family of Rahul Gandhi
but he never called any of his father or
grandmother's or others as destroyed
this is height of air
responsibilities English conduct and
Rahul Gandhi I'm sorry to say you don't
deserve the post you are holding whereas
at your grandmother your father your
great-grandfather Sardar Patel Madonna
Assad doesn't Prasad and others don't
deserve that
alright Ravi Shankar Prasad Union law
minister thank you so much for your time
here so thank you let me bring in my
guests now Patrick pan is a strategic
analyst Nalin Kohli spokesperson of the
BJP and Marshall PK barabra is retired
in fact former vice chief of the IAF for
an Shah Mohammad is a spokesperson of
the Congress Shah Mohammad Airbus is the
manufacturer of the Eurofighter the
Raffles main competitor so when the
Congress president bases his entire
allegation on a competitor's email then
how is the BJP wrong in saying that the
Congress has wrought lobbying for Rafal
skom Pettit errs I don't know from where
first and foremost a lot of lies has
been told by mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad
sorry this echo I'll try and speak as
much as I can because I can hear my own
voice so he said in his this thing that
Hollande has taken back whatever he said
Hollande had clearly said that we were
told to take the sort as the offset
let's talk about the email today lines
defense as the let's talk about the
email that yes I'm coming to that there
are serious charges of a missile I do
take this example not light
he has been can I just speak my dear he
spoke for a long time accusing my leader
saying all sorts of things I have the
right to defend you know I have - right
- I have the right to speak he lied
there mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad was lying
on and off now here is a letter in in
this particular email hmm there is mr.
Solomon who is the advisor to the
defence minister then defense minister
mr.
jean-yves of front and whose email is
there such mr. Ambani is mr. Ambani it's
a four he's had a phone conversation he
says that mr. Solomon the advisor says
that mr. Ambani is coming on I mean miss
money's coming on a short visit but well
plan the first and foremost how does mr.
Ambani get into this defense ministers
office and speak with all these people
when he is not even in the defense
sector he is a businessman he doesn't
have a defense license he has no license
even to make an Airbus they talking
about some helicopters he doesn't he
didn't have a company then so he comes
there he speaks to them in just two days
he forms a company and then he signs an
MoU for ops I mean he says there is no
more you going to be signed by the prime
minister in India okay I'm done how does
he know what secrets pain always about
this MOU sweetie Jake affairs analyst
there is he he seems to be completely
disability
first and foremost today wins mail came
out let me just you know 46 percent
stake and Eurofighter consortium it has
a mere nine point nine percent stakin
resolve deviation which means if the
deal goes to Eurofighter an airbus
benefits more secondly when it comes to
Reliance defense I just did a little
research before coming here reliance in
you know incorporated as realized
defense after it acquired people of
defense in 2015 March so people is a
company which already has got recently a
mastership repairing agreement with
United States Navy for repairing a
seventh fleet which means is not a small
company secondly when we talk about the
number of bills let's see what it was
doing that time in March 2016
reliance had a deal with an Israeli
company called Rafael not Rafal no file
that was the same time he also had a
deal with another Israeli company called
Kalashnikov Israel company he also went
to Russia had deals with certain Russian
companies for offset obligation in India
so when we talk about Airbus Airbus does
not have any offset obligation in the
Dassault deal a last point when you talk
about this MOU to be signed in 10 days
the MOU for Rafael was inked between
India and France in January 2016
yes so what is that talk about this
whole thing happening in 2015 mm in
January 2016 the MOU
sign that bill was signed in September
2016 18 months after mr. Anil Ambani who
went to France for whatever reason right
now they talk but let me also finish it
this is not fair what sort of discussion
is this Mario can I finish please make
your point Sharma all this
so the yeah so there that they say they
sign an MoU so definitely there is a man
here who knows about it and who is going
to mean is that a lie there was no other
name or you side and let me talk about
the eurofighter typhoon the unified -
when this deal the MMRDA deal was off
and mr. Modi was going for they also
came back okay melancholy melancholy
debate of course this is debate of
course it's so debate
you are losing this debate on refining
your monster if you mean allegations
against any every-every institutions you
don't believe in the Supreme Court you
priam the sovereign guarantee
deal during your time you want it deal
during your time show us the sovereignty
that you fear had you have a show it to
the defense minister who said it in the
parliament there was no sovereign
guarantee
let me get your dense aliens I'm not
even a part how can i this is not fair
Mario this is
wrong sternly keep saying it's not for
me it's very very fair debate and you
know it let me so shimakaze made your
point quickly instead of saying I'm not
being afraid not just make your point
you have to ask him to not speak so what
I'm trying to say is that be the
sovereign guarantee was removed whenever
the sovereign guarantee is not according
to them the price of the sovereign
guarantee they remove the corruption
cloth was empty anti-corruption clothes
every level you bring in a landfill for
what did mr. Modi this is treason
mr. Modi should be behind bars for this
because this is shirt reason why did he
remove all these clauses when he came
and said that you know what I come in an
anti-corruption flat don't know I didn't
know the sovereign guarantee we would
like to know why did he remove know the
anti-corruption look at we learned that
so no we need answers for all these and
this is not from us this is from the
finance secretary when the D was
happening of the Ministry of the variant
calling then does the other of this
defense everyone Security Minister do
you know the PMO was overriding that
these are almost remark only coming fast
coming and the affidavit when the
affidavit given the effort of it give it
to the Supreme Court had lies in it so
there were a lot of lies and that's why
the Supreme you know Union is an
unsigned affidavit no then why don't you
challenge it the Congress party did
approach the Supreme Court as well why
haven't you done so so far jpc probe my
question is why are not ready if you are
saying that you know know what I am if
you are saying Mira a false affidavit
before the Supreme Court then go and
challenge it in the serene commits
perjury
go for it why if you say he was a
dependence
let me bring another panelist ready for
a JPG problem you know bring another
panelist Alan :
yes I have many things to say Marian may
I
with your permission just raise a few
points that is the crux your last
question was really the crux of it if
there was even an iota of evidence that
they could muster up to bring back a
point they would have rushed to the
Supreme Court not that they would still
believe in the Supreme Court or
respected judgment because the Supreme
Court has already adjudicated on the
file what we have here is a situation
barring mr. Rahul Gandhi who's a Paragon
and an apostle of truth by the standards
of the Congress party everyone else is a
liar everyone else is a traitor and
everyone else should go to jail that's
been used for the Honorable Prime
Minister mr. shinobi Shankar Prasad my
other leader has been called a liar on
this show it has nothing to do with so
let me give you three examples mr. I
will just give you three comments may I
finish talking over me miss long that is
not going to make you give you a better
case it's your rudeness and I'm sure the
audience can see it you have
uninterrupted training others - I'm sad
patient I'll finish my point yes
disagree I am NOT looking for your
agreement but then Mario Mario little
bite without what is the crux of this
case email is there by Airbus who's a
competitor firm may I
where is this going there is a
competitive firm Airbus they have an
email written internally which how it
lands in Rahul Gandhi G's hands is a
mystery but now let me give you a
counter-argument suppose I say just now
I was on the telephone a short while ago
with mr. al Gandhi he said I'm lying on
this but I have to do it politically
then I email it to Maria shaquille and
Maria would be then in her rights to
take it as breaking news I have received
an e
melancholy is referring to a
conversation with Rahul Gandhi what is
the evidence there has to be some bar of
evidence some standard before you start
referring to these things and making so
much noise
the Supreme Court is not there again as
a defense expert who's saying these are
the facts mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad has
spoken on the sovereign guarantee Clause
for ease in effort to it
then they refer to this cut and paste
job which gets printed in a leading
newspaper the defense ministers own
thing on the same sheet of paper on the
noting is not published and this is
supposed to be a scam you run down the
control ctrl and Auditor General of
India the man was not expenditure
secretary has never dealt with the issue
he was finance secretary there's a
department of a Revenue there's a
department of expenditure expenditure is
where expenditure takes place from I
mean get your facts clear just because
mr. Rahul Gandhi doesn't know how
administration works you can excuse it
but when he starts running down
everybody else who's running
administration that doesn't make him a
great expert and let me finally take the
arguments to mr. Anil Ambani what is his
experience and defence by that standards
what is mr. Rahul Gandhi's experience in
anything has he ever been on a job his
father at least knew he has to report
for duty he had something mr. Rajiv
Gandhi as a pilot what does mr. Rahul
Gandhi done
he is the claimant for the Prime
Minister's job only manufacturing a scam
just to prove a point of mr. Ogami which
has no merits so where is this story
heading can I come in please Mario you
know I am NOT able to rebut to all of
are you asking me is it yes go ahead can
I can I come in mari you have to give me
time please Mariano personally yes go
ahead a Martian India okay okay okay no
no just wait yes now let me say for the
last few months we have been hearing
that the opposition saying that 30,000
CROs have been given to mr. Anil Ambani
I want to ask him has it been given by
cheque firm has it been given by cash
form as they got any
evidence of it being put in his pocket
like he says that is one the congress
spokesperson here this evening is
yelling her guts out trying to repeat
the same things we have heard so many
times it is nothing new you are telling
us ma'am please understand now now the
now the airbus male who Avis was a
competitor and what I am given to
understand from the media is that they
had offered after the selection was made
of Rafael visibly the Eurofighter they
had offered to bring down the price of
Eurofighter by 20% so I don't blame
anyone getting to that side to get
whatever little one can get out of it
okay so please understand now the media
has to be a bit more responsible firstly
by getting people with a little bit of
knowledge on a craft or lady who will
try and impress upon the sorry that's
very rude you have to that is something
seriously wrong with a Congress party
and round down these argument and you
will see constantly keep saying that
it's a lie and then Rahul Gandhi goes a
several steps ahead and almost dismisses
the CAG goes ahead also and says that
the Prime Minister is a middle man isn't
that a very irresponsible statement to
make okay right can I come in now and
can you give me some time no he hasn't
finished continue yes sir go ahead
please continue I haven't finished
finish a point please now now please
understand about the offset contract the
offset contract need not be signed at
the same
time as the main contract you signed it
can be signed even one year later so
this offset contract if it is found not
correct by the government or by the
Parliament at the later date
you can do anything you want to but why
are you preventing this aircraft from
coming in why are you yelling your guts
out it is national security you are
interfering with like please understand
and the public must be made the public
must be told by the responsible media
about the conduct of the Opposition at
this moment okay
Shiva Mohammed we are not saying it you
kidding sorry very sad you keep keep
blaming the media and here are two
experts who are part of Defence Air
Marshal saying clearly that the
opposition is a responsible go ahead
respond okay now can I put my facts can
I put my facts but no Burma's he said he
spoke about the thirty thousand the
thirty thousand crore is not what the
Congress party is saying it is on the
annual report of the sort as well as
reliance defense you have not done your
research it's not my fault please well
these that they have said these are the
offset contract which has been given to
Reliance defense by the sort this is in
their annual report now when mr. Mohan
tea mr. Mohan tea is not the reason they
said they bought thirty-six aircrafts
and not 126 let me finish now is because
they wanted the it to come in urgently
and that's why they had to bind this
thirty-six that was a reason given but
now it's coming in 2022 is the new sake
bogosity term that it will not happen
the of the ship I get it so why is the
new buying one alliance what's and wait
while sharing your document stated what
they will say
with outstanding technology why why did
we do away with that that's a very
important thing we have done it we have
got we are you know coming from the
overriding you know they'll get an
offset what are you talking about
okay sure then there is an MoU how does
he know about facts and a lot of facts
of Shaba you sorry have come out there
Shama Shama Cygnus them are letting me
talk money they are not letting me talk
that's why I have to scream
we are coming on top of me and speaking
okay she is letting me speak what sort
of debate is this one way people are
speaking and I'm not enough to speak no
that's not done that's not true for the
most part it would be fine you know
speaking with my facts no don't say that
you have not spoken for the most part of
this debate you working one more the man
with the blue shirt keeps interrupting
like that human procedure okay
Shama what we will do is really there a
specific question that is coming from us
ex person listen to that listen to that
and then respond well my question is
very simple
how does one become an offset partner of
the saw by talking to one could you know
competitor of the saw which is air was
which is the shareholder of
Eurofighter okay this is my question
response Shama in that letter it is
clearly says that he is going to be
signing the MOU that's what it says and
he did in in two weeks time you sign the
MOU two weeks understand is that the in
do the time he has signed the MOU he did
not have land he did not have anything
so what are we talking here I mean you
always immediately is doing deals with
various guy Minister visits 18 months
only to who as why did mr. Lau move why
didn't mr. shift - uncle know about it
why nobody knew that there was a deal
with okay with me where order lines the
please go ahead sir except except for X
I mean nobody knew except for Anil
Ambani that he is going to be signing
this deal
okay sure nobody knew about this dilemma
I should've listened on I mean how can a
private citizen know about something
like Rafael I mean that's treason
I don't know others are making a
mahogany with cycle have whole disorder
anymore we fed up yes we have now what
do you go ahead with someone willing
guts out here but the fact lies here she
she is not very clear now 59,000 crows
is the deal and 50% is the offset clause
which has to be signed by the saw and
not anil ambani
and they have got two more partners the
engines and the electronics so then
there are about 80 to 100 partners in
India all this money has got to be split
based on the job they will do so that
gas or make back their money of 30,000
in India you are not shooting through
your you have to give somebody
experience the procedure please sorry
ma'am I'll just tell you one thing
people maintains the 7 unit of United
States Navy that means they have
experience this is this is what will be
over the nature
weeks and months do you want the
election my question sir do they let you
continue who say that now I look
suddenly it looks like it certainly
looks like that as far as facts are
concerned the facts are becoming the
casualty here in this water words that
are playing out thank you so much but
every family yes okay
quickly quickly Nolan Nolan yes ten
seconds Nolan look yes I'm only
concerned about one thing something that
the Defense Forces need because a
squadron strength is going down
repeatedly we are heading to a critical
level of 26 in 1971 India had two and a
half times the aircraft as Pakistan
today we are probably competing with the
same number with them let's not forget
the territory we live in and this was a
deal that in terms of selection took
place in the UPA time its completion has
happened under Prime Minister Modi we
need to stand by our defence forces
now listen to their means with all of
this I'm not sure of the Congress party
is helping those who are inimical to
India's interests and in the same
process demoralizing our armed forces
we're willing to lay down their lives
for I need it melancholy a marshal
PK Barbara patty Creek pan and Shah
Mohammad thank you so much for joining
us so sir one thing is clear that truth
has become a casualty in this water
words that is playing out it's almost a
document today and facts being clouded
perhaps that is what is happening under
foul deed

a mega roadshow in Lucknow by the Gandhi
siblings with Rahul Gandhi saying we
respect circulation Marathi but will
fight with all our might tvp's
chandrababu naidu's protest in delhi
sees an unexpected visitor Sanjay Raut
of the Shiv Sena this as Modi continues
to stay on his campaign blitz creek the
election season is upon us
but fluid and shifting alliances is
making the matrix complex yogic
viewpoint on CNN news 18 our Maha
Siddiqui tonight we'll take a look at
the ongoing tussle for form alliances on
both sides because in the absence of a
particular vase it's the Alliance's that
will play kingmaker in the battle of
2019 let's now take a look at the
shifting back lines in the Battle of
2019 first here's the moody blog these
are the parties that have stuck together
or have come together rather to form the
NDA but there are many neutral parties
even at this point because they have not
at this point either gone to the ready
block or come to the anti body block
that has been formed especially with the
help of somebody like Chandrababu Naidu
who has cobbled up for this aunty Modi
block the neutral bloc includes TRS
voice rcpa AIADMK Beach ad in all they
make up about a hundred and thirty seats
these four states that these people
represent make up about a hundred and
thirty crucial looks of our seats we'll
take a look at whether these people are
likely to shift their alliances soon
move from the neutral bloc to either of
the sides the anti Modi block includes
all these people at the moment but there
are a lot of inherent contradictions
here my avati an Achilles shadow
together in yuffie but congress out of
that and the other alliances not firmed
up meanwhile Shiv Sena's also showing
signs of trying to go to the other side
today Sanjay Raut was present at DDP
leader Chandrababu sana chandrababu
naidu's protests led
take a look at how these neutral players
can actually change the situation now if
two of these move here 61 seats is what
they represented all in their state
numbers which ship to the moody block
will that be advantage Modi or Avila
sees some chinks in their armor as well
as I pointed out the Shiv Sena which
could move elsewhere the neutral block
still has the TRS Weiss are CP both of
them have not indicated their leanings
at the moment the TRS have said they
will not go with either the BJP all the
Congress as far as the Y's are serious
concern today Chandrababu Naidu has said
that he is willing to go ahead and
perhaps form an alliance with Jagan
Mohan Reddy as well but before we dive
into that big debate on how the
Alliance's are going to be actually
determining who the winner of 2019 is
let's chat with Salman Khurshid he is a
person a leader from Uttar Pradesh and
today we saw that pushed by the Congress
party in Uttar Pradesh with Priyanka
Gandhi the newly appointed general
secretary off with her pradesh is
holding a road show miserable she a
massive road show today in Lucknow is
Priyanka Gandhi's entry into active
politics a pressure building tactic to
make the SP BSP rethink the alliance
without the Congress party in yupi not
at all not at all I mean this is
something that the workers have been
demanding for a long time this is
something that was widely widely desired
she obviously had had her own personal
reasons for choosing the right time and
she's fortunately chosen the time when
we need the best foot forward and I
believe that the her entry into politics
is done already done wonders to the
spirit and we the the confidence of the
Congress worker now we have to put that
into proper structures we have to put
that into proper work so that 2000 2019
is a good result
across the country you Paul this Salman
Khurshid the right time how is it the
right time for Priyanka Gandhi when her
husband Robert Vadra is under the IDI
scanner and the Congress has its lowest
tally in utter Pradesh well I mean if if
if the growing is stuff shouldn't
shouldn't we get tough as well to bring
out bring out our best as you call the
trump card will bring out the best and
we shouldn't be we shouldn't be in two
minds that you know our best is not good
enough is not something that we should
doubt we should have complete and total
confidence and what we believe is our
best and we are putting forward that
best foot now as far as as far as other
implications and other issues are
concerned there is a concerted effort to
distract us by attacking leaders and
their families and this has been going
on for some time and therefore this is
not going to discourage us we will take
that in our stride we have ability and
we have capacity to handle any of these
tricks that they're going to play on us
but at the end of the day it's it's loud
and clear loud and clear that this has
changed the buzz in the in the country
certainly in in utter Pradesh and I am
confident that we look forward to four
very very good results as a consequence
of this look forward to good results
does it then mean that the Congress
party is going to be contesting all 80
seats in yupi to make the most of it or
is it going to be more realistic and
stick to where there is a fair chance
see we are we are coming out of
obviously a very very dark period we've
we've had a tough upward climb in yupi
for some years now I've all species he
president tonight I'm quite conscious of
how difficult it was but we did go up to
22 seats in parliament from 0 to 22 is a
long journey but we haven't been able to
sustain that over a period and certain
2014 was a very very bad election for
all of us now with given given that we
have to strategize so that we don't
spread ourselves too thin but frankly we
don't have an alliance we tried hard for
an alliance we were willing for an
alliance and if it doesn't happen then
as a responsible important political
party we must go back and fight all the
seats but our president has said very
clearly very clearly that whenever there
is a chance to cooperate with any other
party that's like-minded you will not
want you would not find Congress wanting
so let's let's take it there but we
can't keep we couldn't have kept waiting
indefinitely then is there a chance then
if you say that to you no one would want
to fight all seats but that doesn't seem
to be a pragmatic approach is there a
chance then that in some seats you might
create a triangular contest between the
SP BSP on the one side Congress and BJP
on many seats and will it not be
advantage BJP ultimately then well I
hope sincerely hope that that won't
happen but the final strategy will will
be worked worked through in the next few
days both general secretaries are going
to be in Lucknow for four days meeting
leaders workers from all districts and I
think a common a common view will then
emerge as to what kind of strategy we
should adopt and for me to be talking
about the specifics of a strategy would
be both unfair to my leadership as
indeed to our party because we can't let
the other side know exactly what we plan
to do but you use the word if there is
the word cooperation saying that if
there is a possibility there will be
cooperation does it mean that the
Congress party will then avoid putting
Muslim Dalit and OBC candidates and go
only with upper caste candidates to cut
into BJP votes specifically we are a
rainbow party we have a party that's
that that thrives and survives on
contribution of every community every
section of society and certainly
a subject to subject to final strategy
about fine-tuning our attack on the BJP
we will ensure that we spread across the
spectrum and that everybody participates
but obviously obviously not at the cost
of losing seats we will have to see how
we how we combine principle with
pragmatism and that's how that's how one
does politics you can't be you can't be
blind to ground reality so looking at
ground reality what is the best best
performance that we can get from
whichever candidate we will put that
candidate forward okay so a kill each
other said at a forum that while the SP
BS we are trying to defeat Modi others
and possibly he means the Congress here
are using this to build their base is
the Congress not serious about defeating
BJP in a state like you P which sends
the maximum number of MPs to Parliament
see let's be fair to everyone let's be
fair to them our president has already
said that he respects their choice he
respects their decision and he respects
them overall now we can have differences
we can have issues of perception and
strategy but at the end of the day every
party just as much as just as the
Congress as indeed the Samajwadi and the
BSP have a right to survive they have a
right to survive now if you want to
survive what is the element that you you
have to accept in terms of accommodation
of other parties in the circumstances in
which we are going into this fight and
what are the circumstances in which you
continue to hope that you will regain
some of your lost ground of the past it
is only a fair fair matter of analysis
for each party but let me just tell you
very clearly our commitment to defeat
the BJP is second to none and mr. Rahul
Gandhi has gone out of his way to reach
out to people who are not friends
political friends in the past but he's
broken many many barriers he's traveled
the extra he's traveled the extra mile
and I hope that this will be seen as a
positive gesture by everybody including
the Samajwadi and the BSP mr. courgette
is there a possibility of a tire pitch
shift Pal Yadav now that you're out of
the SP BSP Alliance CI I have no I no
idea but frankly mr. mr. al Gandhi our
president has said that all like-minded
parties that are willing to work
together to defeat the BJP we will be
willing to cooperate with we hadn't
excluded anybody we hadn't indicated
anyone till such time as somebody comes
and shakes hands and stands with us on a
stage to say we are together and he's
continuing to do this I hope that his
best efforts succeed and he is able to
put together the grand alliance that he
is working on now we do know that some
people believe there will be no grand
alliance but there will be alliances
which are state specific but an
aggregate of those alliances which are
state specific will be in a sense
something quite similar to what a grand
alliances okay and rahul gandhi's today
also said that leaders who roam about in
helicopters will not be promoted but
those who work at the ground level
specifically with regards to threat
Pradesh realistically does the Congress
even have those sort of leaders and you
P well you're going to make a start
somewhere every time you introduce a new
leader people think that you know this
person has no history as no legacy he
has no no accomplishment and achievement
but it's those young leaders who then
transform themselves into what are
called giant killers now frankly there
are ways and means of describing what we
will do there is some some of that
language is symbolic some of that
language is substantive but the end of
the day we are looking for winners and
we will find winners across the board
particularly amongst young people and
let's not forget that this is not about
one election alone and for people who
are fighting this election hoping that
this is the last election against the
BJP are making a mistake we will have
many elections to come many many years
ahead
we have to look at it will not be easy
to weed out the kind of poison that's
been injected into our society and
therefore we have to work hard on on a
long long term basis it's the long
journey but we must take the first step
in 2019 so you're saying this is a long
term basis on which the Congress party
is working in you pee that drinks me to
my final question mr. Hoshi Rahul Gandhi
has also indicated the same with regards
to Priyanka Gandhi saying that she is in
it that is in active politics for the
long run but she'll be judged for her
performance in the looks of my elections
that are just round the corner as well
how will she tackle that situation if
the results are not as for expectations
and let me tell you expectations are
very high see when you go into an
electoral battle you can't go with
certainty you go into electoral battle
in good times and in bad times you go in
challenging times and you go and
comforting times now it depends on your
staying capacity as a leader to steer
yourself through bad a bad election
results and good election results so you
can't just simply say the look I will
come only when everything is is
hunky-dory and fine you have a challenge
we all feel the challenge there is the
bus created by her joining and there is
a sense of sense of of feeling that we
can do something but all of us all over
have to put our head down together and
work very very hard and that's the
tribute I guess that we will pay to her
by by acknowledging that she has joined
the active active politics and she will
lead us from the front both in yippee
and beyond yippee but that's the big
question whether this buzz this charisma
will be enough to take the Congress into
a state to victory where it has pretty
much been decimated my Ethel Salman
Khurshid for speaking with us the blunt
question therefore that we are asking
tonight is will the right alliances be
the 2019 kingmaker
joining us on the show tonight
consumptive re samajwadi party
spokesperson joining us here in the
studio
Narendra Tunisia BJP spokesperson our
joy bows resident commentator Murray
chief Mendell TMC supporter and Sanjay
Jha congress spokesperson I want to
first go across to Narendra Tunisia and
Narendra Tunisia you heard extensively
what Salman Khurshid had to say there
but clearly the fact remains that one
single person or personality is not
creating buzz in these elections
it is the Allies the Alliance's that
really even the two national parties are
looking for the BJP and the Congress
party is the BJP worried that the
alliance that the Mahad Bandhan is
trying to forge at this point could be
formidable I listened to mr. Salman for
interesting I thought he's good to know
that he is still in the Congress I
thought he has left the Congress long
time but good thanks for that and now to
answer your question I don't know what
you mean because as far as we are
concerned we are pretty confident going
by the reality on the ground and the
feedback that we are getting from from
the people on the ground we are getting
a majority entirely on our own and of
course at the same time you will have
NDA
and we are looking at something like you
know more than 300 seats in total so
therefore what's happening in Lucknow
all this and all that that's something
for you guys to follow and for mr.
Salman Khurshid as I said I didn't know
that he's still in the Congress but for
them to celebrate and all that but as
far as we are concerned we look at the
reality on the ground and the state you
are referring to particularly Luther to
this and we are keeping a very close eye
on every single constituency we we take
a realistic view and we are pretty
confident that we are for me the yeah
and we are we are getting the number
that we need on our own and also NBA
because NDA is also close to 40 parties
part of NDA and but but the nucleus
there
BJP of the NDA will get the majority and
tiny light with it in 2014
without new plus you can't have analyzed
that you are keeping an eye on all the
developments are you keeping an eye on
your allies also because one of your
allies today went and met Chandrababu
Naidu but you can of course report that
and all that we know dr. Manmohan Singh
was also there and all that's fine but
you see that but that makes no
absolutely no difference as far as our
relationship our partnership should say
and is concerned Shiv Sena and BJP our
partnership is very strong and we are go
fight election and 2019 in the parts
where we enjoy the partnership together
I mean these optics are fine these
optics you know you understand politics
for entirely different reasons and these
things are done sometime in politics but
it does mean that there is going to be
any fundamental change as far as our
partnership relationship with Shiv Sena
is concerned we are going to fight
together and defeat Congress party
squarely in my roster RJ bolsa do you
believe what not into Tunisia says there
that there will be no fundamental change
that these are just for optics
what is the shifts then are looking for
I find it very funny that Narendra
Tunisia say is that these are optics
because you know Shiv Sena every day it
does something to provoke the BJP and
for the past several months it's been
doing it and today was the height of it
I mean here was you know no Chandra Babu
Naidu and the opposition parties getting
together in a clearly anti Modi anti-bjp
you know you know you know turn and
protest and to have the Shiv Sena send
his representative and sitting down I
mean these are not offerings these are
terrible really I mean I mean I I mean I
don't know how come the BJP still with
the Shiv Sena
after all these insults will every other
day the Shiv Sena comes out with some
provocative statement of the other but
it's not just the Shiv Sena the BJP has
other problems if you look at ughter
Pradesh they've just got an ultimatum
from one of the very key you know you
know backward
party you know and why the minister you
know sort of Raj where is a minister in
the U P government and they have said
that you know unless you give in to our
demands
we are leaving by the 24th of February
so I think the BJP is having a lot of
problem with allies and I think that
this time it will find it quite
difficult really to have because many of
his main allies have also left you know
you know that the BJP as you're pointing
out a joggers the BJP may be having
problems with its allies but what about
the Mohammed Vanden itself all of the
constituents of the so-called Margaret
Bandhan are only looking at tactical
alliances and you know in the case of U
P Congress has not even found a place in
the Alliance a gun Shakti body today
when Rahul Gandhi say just a second
sorry just one second okay go ahead yeah
quickly yeah I just wanted to say just
point out that the Congress is not such
a big factor in Uttar Pradesh so you
know the main main opposition to the BJP
there is the BSP via line nobody at the
end of the day if the Congress party
aspires to lead the market but then from
the front 80 seats is what if the
British sense how can they be you know
we're told by the SP BSP that will only
give you two seats that is that is
exactly what achalasia them has been
saying and sham Tiwari you knew from day
one that the Congress will not agree to
that
well the clearly the the Alliance is not
a top-down formula to accommodate
everybody at at capacity it is basically
a ground sub grassroot sense of politics
political acumen that where does the
battle lines of authority as a JBoss
uses lie the battles of the Pradesh lie
in defeating Martha Giunta party in
their design in their propaganda in
there but will it not be advantage
Bharatiya janta party now will it not
become a triangular contest on most of
the seats as we pointed out well we do
not think so in in Gorakhpur fool poor
Khurana we have seen some imprints of
this matter so are you saying it's going
to be a friendly fight then you know in
Caracas not offending fight it is clear
I'm asking for the loss of elections now
I wanna make this very clear
we believe that people in Uttar Pradesh
want to work for change too
decisive leadership who has a track
record and who has leadership and
organization in the state and that is
how we think that people Arthur Kadesh
especially the farmers the youth the
poor the delayed the backwards the the
minorities the women have made up their
mind and this is going to be a word
against BJP is double and incumbents
explain how you're going to address the
splintering of wood Sanjay Jha is that a
concern you know the Congress party your
party is saying we will we are there to
put all our might we are going to
contest God knows how many seats at this
point but largely if you are planning to
contest even say 30 seats where you had
a margin of over one black or had over
one lakh Bahts now will it not become a
triangular fight will it not be
advantage BJP what kind of an alliance
is this Oh Bob before I answer your
question I mean the BJP spokesperson
made a very sarcastic dig at whether mr.
Salman Khurshid was with the Congress or
not I think I think poor general
knowledge the fact that he was from the
Congress was in the slug and more
importantly he should worry because the
Shiv Sena seems to agree with what mr.
doar Gandhi says of Narendra Modi chalk
in the arch or hair and but you can
imagine how compromised the BJP is in
its political desperation it still runs
behind the tail of the Shiv Sena but let
me answer your fundamental question see
the truth is that the U P is going to be
in our opinion the the real death knell
for the BJP I completely agree with what
Ghanshyam ji mentioned even for the
Congress party way very clear is the BJP
which is a massive threat to Indian
democracy which is a party that is
blatantly playing religious polarization
destroying our society they need to be
defeated I think what mr. Gandhi said
today was highly pragmatic politics we
have a great deal of respect for both
Maya wattages BSP and occasionally dodge
of these SP we have an understanding in
multiple days you have an alliance there
they supported us in Rajasthan and I
think we see a post-poll coalition
definitely emerging but look at the
desperate
but your election Sanjar Susan Tina
please hear me on that we should look at
just let me tell you feel splintered
just well then how is a post poll
Alliance going to help well let me tell
you this
we are extremely confident and you can
see that the kind of response that
Priyanka Gandhi vedras entry is already
made I mean the response that you know I
thought was overwhelming and we have not
even started the campaign yet so there
is going to be I I believe a very
formidable opposition that the Congress
party is but Sanjaya don't you have been
long enough to know the nominees
campaigns and rallies is no way a
reflection of how they're going to vote
aye
I agree with that I agree with that but
it also tells you that end of day the
Congress party has a lot of groundswell
support
I have concede the point that we have to
create an organizational network at the
ground level to convert this into a huge
political electoral advantage but I want
to make one point for you look at BJP
and be hard
they won 22 seats in 2014 but now that
they are appearing cornered and they
know they're going to be wiped off in
most of the states of India in Bihar
they're actually contesting 17 so
they're already down by five season be
hard even before the election has been
announced so I think these are visible
manifestations of a changing political
narrative and I think the mahogany
Munden is a reality mr. Naidu talking
about actually align align with Weiser
tells you the kind of accommodation and
the regional parties are willing to make
because we all recognize that Modi and
Amit Shah have destroyed India's
institution ruin you brought your
corruption into the next question area
in a way senator let's take two states
that you particularly mentioned here one
of Bihar the other of the BJP being
highly compromised you said with regards
to the shifts in under in rittany Jaya
will you answer both those questions the
the shifts then are constantly hurling
insults at the BJP why does the BJP
still wanted
with the Shiv Sena and what about be
hard you see unlike my friends from the
Congress party I'm not going to shout
slogans democracy Karima yeah I don't
need to do that we are a very strong
party very national party and the
gentleman we were talking about earlier
one
I saw a reports in media that that that
gentleman you interviewed earlier was
tried was knocking at the door of a very
large very large national political
party but that party didn't accepted
media reports very large political party
you see the point is so that was I was
referring to now the point as far as
shiv sena our relationship is concerned
you see if Shiv Sena yes Rogan see
people shouting doesn't matter that's
what you do on all debates you only
shout slogans now the point if chana our
relationship with Shiv Sena is concerned
it's not like that that we are after
them or they are after us it's a it's a
time-tested relationship it's a time
that is relation so all political
parties do their own you know sometimes
they do their maneuvers they have their
own way of negotiation they agree with
me there has to be some mutual respect
between allies that doesn't seem to
exist now with the Shiv Sena well that's
that's that's you what you think but we
interact with steps naina 24 by 7 and
there's a lot of respect not only
respect there is great admiration that's
what it is great admiration otherwise
relationship was really you know be that
strong this is strong because you dot as
I said you can you have the choice to go
by optics that they want to create for
your consumption of Congress
consumptions and others but at the same
time the slogan because you've already
said that you're tired of listening to
slogans but who that father has has
taken the Rahul Gandhi slogan and said
it at a podium sir what mutual respect
are we talking about here which was joka
doctor the there is mutual respect as I
said that there's not only this thing
you know great admiration but I want to
share one thing with you I am from Uttar
Pradesh Sanjay I will never understand
in authority is the most important thing
done Shanthi body will understand but I
don't know whether if this
graeme will go along with me inaud in
Uttar Pradesh in a city lilac know if
you come and use a language the kind of
language mr. Rahul Gandhi by using
during his speech
Chalky's Archer and all that I can share
one thing with you but this language you
see the language and she didn't listen
listen ma ma you gave first extra 15
minute exclusive to the Congress leader
I even forgot that he is still the most
people will know even in the Congress
now in your house again what verses all
and you are not letting me complete my
sentence and the Congress tape recorder
is love your love to challenge complete
the point you are making Sundays half
please point I'm trying to a point I am
trying to make his point I have tried to
make it very clear the point is that all
the Congress spokesmen they can come in
the form of other parties in all them
but they are always speaking for the
Congress all tamasha that we have seen
is the Congress it supposed to be the
grand old party leading now or knees
before SP and DSP please accommodate her
the today's tamartian Latino was only to
plead before ecclesia of G and Maya was
easy
please accommodate us that's the status
that's the you know kind of situation of
the so-called greatness all right party
literally your needs pleading to respond
now on both both the points that that
in principle I I would subscribe to what
tonight I say the Nagi is saying but the
reality is you look at what is playing
out between said T DPN and BJP the Prime
Minister goes to another position and
addresses the chiefest of other dish as
location father that is the the level at
which the Prime Minister has to deal
with his own XLI who was his true
champion who was a man who stood behind
him on a bad decision like D
monetization where even the chief
economic adviser today would not stand
with so if BJP is resorting to this kind
of language and the discourse they have
with Shiv Sena every day later the NDA
partners turn on the media with a bloody
eye and they say this is optics we are
together there is no respect in this
language there's no respect in the kind
of language that you use against memmove
t who was your excellence Martell
there's no respecting the kind of
language Prime Minister used on Nitish
Kumar and it is quasi responded yet we
are you are alliance partners so clearly
if there is a discourse and lack of
chemistry that one has to see and in
alliance okay Mohnish it Mundell would
you then say alliances are the need of
the r it is the alliances that will be
the kingmaker both the BJP and the
Congress are aware of it and that is why
this compromised situation as far as we
are concerned it is very much in fact
and shaping up very very clearly you
could see it on 19th of January now you
are seeing it on Delhi so it's very much
there it's not that on the other side
they have only three or four parties and
even wins the biggest party of the BJP
ship chedda
and then every other day they are
singing different kind of tunes so BJP
and you talk about the Mohammed band on
the alert the attack from the other side
is constantly about who the leader of
the small good man then is the leader or
leader leader of the market will be
decided by the after the election
everybody knows but if they have got one
leader let him let him stick the movie
versus question he has become more
narcissus
he was before he is talking about
himself mutti mutti moody I mean I mean
latif latif not dream about himself they
deemed him about the country he has
created Joomla he has Ronald Joomla
factory from the very very top for very
long period of time the people of India
have exposed this person and we are
going to only after the election is
going to be a fool and we didn't BJP
there is a Modi verses that is playing
out where that is that is this happens
when you want to make that the election
a personality contest that within your
own frame people start looking at other
personalities okay okay you made a point
there after that a JBoss is it going to
be Moody was his question mark I mean
even though gan-chan Suvari is saying
that there are other contenders now in
the NDA and he's named a few of them but
even now the Mohammed woman doesn't seem
to have a leader well you know you must
understand that historically having
covered Indian politics and Indian
elections for over 40 years it is quite
often that you have one strong party
with a leader being fought by a whole
conglomeration of parties who do not
necessarily have one leader who's
leading them and this has happened again
and again in 1977 it happened you know
in again 2004 it happened you know it
does happen and you know even a man like
we re watch why did not have a clear-cut
opponent but he lost so I don't think we
should get too carried away by the fact
that there is no single leader what I'm
noticing over the past several months is
that the Opera
and this whole scattered opposition is
getting more and more bold
there is no question their campaign is
getting more and more aggressive the
Congress is aggressive but so are the
various regional parties in their own
spheres they are powerful and they have
very special was that could also be
counterproductive you must understand
can i no no no no no no not at all it
cannot be counterproductive because even
in 2014 you must remember that mr. Modi
at his height of his glory and power he
got hardly anything in Bengal
he got hardly anything in Tamilnadu he
got hardly anything into ERISA so it's
not that one litre this is not a soul
please try and understand okay this is
not a presidential poll that one leader
takes everything okay if you see the
history of India election it has not
happened like this all right you can
watch it I was having various you
brought up power you brought up the
question of Tamil Nadu I'll take that
question not in return each other in the
taniwha is the BJP looking at an
alliance with the a AIADMK is it forming
up is it going to happen well you know
we know a team very well we have very
good chemistry as you know it was very
well with them and just wait for some
time you see the as he said we know that
party very well and then I was very very
is an announcer in Tamil Nadu you know
well you see me as I said that you know
you know you see the point is that we
have good relationship as we as I told
you that we are working on the whole
picture and we will come out with you
know as far as the formal part is
concerned later but as I said we have a
very good relationship with them and our
chemistry between BJP and AI DMK is
absolutely fantastic but let me point
out you know one thing you were talking
about get burned up first of all people
of India including us we are also part
of the people of India we don't see any
mahogany but now all we see kind of
maneuvers we kind of you know
optics spectacles like we saw in out
today Tamara's and all that we're a
party has to go to Lucknow in depth
Priyanka ji into the party declared that
she's general secretary just for one
thing in order so that they can
negotiate and bargain with BSP and SP so
is that that kind of you know mahogany
Pune we are talking about
Mumtaz II did what wanted it now she
planned to come to Delhi and come you
know go for that all kind of thing is
that kind of spectacle be able to see is
that what mahogany is all about is very
good they're doing all this what they
did is country does many such market
bundles these are all tug bundles and
bundles have no place sandwich a
sandwich at that allegation is being
constantly made that this is a pressure
tactic had the SV BSP not rousted the
Congress party from an alliance Luther
Pradesh perhaps Priyanka Gandhi would
not have stepped into active politics at
this juncture where things are looking
even more difficult to her husband is
under the IDI scanner and the pressure
on aim is only growing it appears maha
let me tell you the first correction
that we need to make is to stop trying
to brand the 2019 elections as Modi
versus the rest Modi is got 40 alliance
partners in 2014 16 have deserted him
already because of the massive
monumental disaster he has been for the
country so this is not Modi versus the
rest it is Modi
if at all versus the rest of India and
when the Mohave at Milan is now becoming
not just a work in progress but a
reality you can see the political
arrogance of the gentleman on the on the
channel I mean you know he doesn't even
recognize that Mother Pradesh
Chhattisgarh rajasthani the heart of
central India you have been
comprehensively defeated my friend
so the I tell you what the truth is the
truth is such bravado happens all the
time because there is panic there's
panic written all over the place and I
can tell you one reason why mr. Rahul
Gandhi and I think the entire opposition
with him are raising the issue
Rafael because we have realized that
unemployment rural distress rising
inflation are affecting the common man
across the country and all opposition
parties have recognized how a
Sardar in the remote they have destroyed
Indian democracy I would like to tell
you of viewers there is a tape in
Karnataka which has been released by us
by mr. kumara Swamy this says which has
mr. Yoder APPA saying that narendra modi
enemies shocked and fixed Supreme Court
judges so you're talking about a banana
republic a small dirt house into a nice
doctor this way not this is not rhetoric
this is not hyperbole well let let them
say what it wants the beach will give me
time to rebut this Long Island si are on
the tape where Manohar Parrikar has been
quoted as having said that he's got in
his master bedroom so this is a okay
he only comes out slogan Ramananda isn't
it true that when Mamata Banerjee sat on
that Donna it appeared that she also had
ambitions really to project herself as a
possible leader of the Mahad Bandhan
will that scuttle the market fund on an
alliance we just so desperately required
at this point even even from that
particular amount of energy she has made
very clear that we don't have any egos
in fact although all the big political
leaders of this maja got burned on they
are they they have they have there he
goes in the pocket they are not even
thinking about who is going to be the
prime minister or only only motive and
objective is to save this country by
removing this party called BJP under mr.
Amit Shah at least under moody and mr.
Taneja
I challenge you forget about the speaks
people are running away from you from
photographing with mr. moody except to
tea party JK you know it is
[Music]
I want to come to you for the final word
because here it is very obvious and
conjunctive re made a point on how there
is a tussle now or at least it appears
to be so
within the BJP itself for who is going
to lead the party so are you now
desperately looking at alliances as well
would you admit then it will be the
right alliances that will help you come
back to part if at all you see I mean
you are entitled your opinion and
Ghanshyam Tiwari ji and I to know his
opinion I mean people have just
democracy but there's nothing to do with
the fact Bharatiya Janata Party in Prime
Minister Narayan Murthi is the prime
minister he will be the Prime Minister
post May 20 19 because that's what the
people of India want Oh miss cha ji
heads the party is the head of the party
and as I said you know but we are a
democratic party people who are part of
the family owned enterprises they would
they don't they won't understand how a
political party which has internal
democracy functions people talk people
give their interviews express their
opinion and then people do that because
this because these family own can I can
I complete mr. Mundell if you allow me
now the point is Roger your words will
recall Congress party look at for
instance you know look at Congress both
in his arrogance look at the arrogance
of the Congress party spokesperson he
comes shout slogans he is never prepared
he knows nothing about his own party his
party declared M
but it's important for the BJP would you
admit that let me tell you one thing BJP
as BJP we are getting the number we need
to form the government lndia is
important and together with NDA we are
going to get more than 350 kind of
alliances they have one second I can
joke Sunday charge is that we have to
wrap it up Sanders also Joker both sides
are saying that their alliances are
strong enough for them to be able to win
the Lok Sabha elections of 2019 but at
the end of the day it's the voter who
will take the final

so here is the chief minister who says
gel this gel Dimas law solve on a cha
here fine enough omit Malviya I'm trying
to understand is this a worried chief
minister after what happened at the
harem sunset in which RSS chief Mohan
Bhagwat was asked that question Tariq
but I hear you know he's a chief
minister who seized with the matter
he seized with the aspirations of
millions of Hindus who live in the state
of Uttar Pradesh just like in India and
rest of the world Ram Janmabhoomi issue
has been a vexed issue and when it is a
given that there was indeed a ram temple
it has been established by the Allahabad
High Court judgement it is painfully I
let me finish
which painfully studied the various
arguments counter-arguments matters of
history the Archaeological Survey of
India is report and a whole host of
other inputs that it took before it
arrived at this judgment it is such an
irony that India which is the cradle of
Hindu civilization has to debate whether
there should be a temple right now for
the Supreme Court now be as it may be
I'm talking about the current
we should now an elected chief minister
and why should chief minister of Uttar
Pradesh say what he did in the assembly
today well Maria that's because he also
represents the aspiration of the people
of the state and while the matter is
pending in the Supreme Court and we have
seen how in a very Cavalier fashion the
Supreme Court had pushed aside this
matter for a hearing much later which
caused all the consternation that we saw
amongst the Saints amongst the Hindu
society and the world at large
he's only trying to perhaps make a point
that should there be a reconciliatory
approach from those who are holding on
to a very small parcel of land and what
is otherwise you know application has
been given by your government in the
epics court that the significant part
that is the main chunk 67 acres of land
should be returned to its original
owners Maulana Masood al-hassan cost me
I've been interpretation kid Chief
Minister Gaffney beyond Sunna instead of
bayonetta he topolitically
shied he looked nahin toes are curling
your shoddy nature I take a Supreme
Court judgement I he look up my path
which I'll chicken the kiosk area
Hickory he repelled about - yeah he is
blatantly disrespected respecting the
Constitution Constitution very clearly
stipulates that that the head of the
shed cannot take any religion side oh
he's talking in the woods talking in the
assembly despite being a chief minister
of the state this is the content of the
court matter e sub judice right now and
him they must know that there the young
Indian who were born after next after
the next direction of the Babri Masjid
they are not passionate about that I was
in Madhya Pradesh I have spoken to young
Indians and they are very passionate
about Rama temple you know a mcmalley of
my question to you is this the Prime
Minister has said something we have
heard from the Prime Minister was was
very categorical that there is no
question of an ordinance
why is yogi Edyta not raising this issue
have you decided has the BJP decided
Ravi speaking a tell people voices not
at all Mario you know what the Prime
Minister has said is exactly what the
chief minister of Uttar Pradesh is
echoing the prime minister said the
matter is sub judice we will have to
wait for the Supreme Court to opine on
it one way or the other and all means
within the regime it is not saying that
right we are available to build our
temple there is a reconciliation that
happens it is perfectly against their
RSS and hardline elements in RSS are
again the Prime Minister initiative but
I am elated to press for the code
settlement he doesn't talk about the
legislation or ordinance and here the
people from your party are creating
harder for prime leader playing tribal
person you know your own house is not in
order sir I mean are you are you are you
going to to accept of code final welded
on this dispute sir do you believe in
code sir do it that's the RSS and Babar
believe in quotes in our constitution
sir okay Amit Malviya yet you know Marya
I'm not going to speculate on what the
Supreme Court is eventually going to
find but I do know the leaders who
obviously wanted to subjugate the Indian
population and they wanted to erase
every memory of this guy why sure
perhaps right now man
but but I mean Malviya I remember BJP
president has said that it's about
grande Ram temple all of you are
committed towards it but why is the
Chief Minister speaking completely
different from what the Prime Minister
has be saying and is he trying to create
a hurdle I would agree with Mawlana
Masuda lesson Cosme why is he saying
what he is saying
and he is speaking in the assembly I
mean he has staged SM you know he has
simply said Maria he has simply said
that he must have said and there's
nothing wrong in saying that it is one
of the options that's available and
unfortunately the Muslim groups have
been holding up this reconciliation
process but then new world you never
know that anything could happen and if
there is something but there are some
discussions going on and it could lead
in that direction is what perhaps the
chief minister of Uttar Pradesh is
alluding to and he's well within his
rights for our the matters we issue can
be resolved in 24 hours a itself the
chief minister of Uttar Pradesh millions
of people who live in a state no sir
is it a diversionary tactic sir
is it the tactic of diversion from the
real issues of the country sir when the
people are more and more education cm
yogi of the purple day he must be very
much talking about this thing and
distress of the Afghani cultural

van on fire as well in retaliation the
police resorted to firing to scare of
the protesters a state government
delegation has already met protesters on
drill tracks but gujo leaders have said
no to talks over the table in Jaipur
they say a letter promising them five
percent reservation should be given on
the spot which means on rail tracks over
thirty one trains have been diverted and
twenty one trains have been cancelled on
the Delhi Mumbai route woods are
demanding five percent quota and
government jobs and educational
institutions that was promised to them
by the Congress in its election

can you just answer one question when
did we actually tell the government that
we are going to stop the roads and stop
the trains it was on 18th of January it
is more than 20 days plus the government
did not do anything about it just sat on
it it is a straight indication that the
government wanted the trains to get
stock and the
government wanted the roads to get
gentle now at one end you want to
instigate and on the other hand when
when what we have said is being done you
are trying to put force onto people
I mean what is happening it seems that
the government does not want to execute
its election manifesto but wants to
cover and pressurize the people
specifically the Hoosier community
people and the referees and the other
one people in there is busy slaw this is
the big issue if you are saying go mad
not hearing you how can the agitators
well it is tall there there was some
firing in the air right yeah so can you
tell me if there is a fire in the air
whether it was fired in the air or was
it fired on somebody how would you know
I mean let's be brilliant about it now
and what was the need to fire in the air
when the people were when which was
already clearly told that we are going
to stop the roads listen to me that we
are going to stop the roads a cake mini
Thursday's of all poochy just a switch a

wants to get into a fistfight nobody
wants to get into a fistfight I don't
want the community does not what they
are getting forced to a man who's who
wants to fight nobody wants do we wish
you any appeal we have already I don't a
few moments back we have been telling
people we have called people up also the
stay safe distance do not get into
anything but people should not get
instigated and they should the authority
should not instigate people as well it
has to be both ways
give me one thing I have a straight
question to the government when we had
asked you for a reservation
why aren't you giving it why are you
forcing us into
come on the roads and yes food
absolutely because we have categorically
said in the beginning that this is what
we will do but the government instead of
being proactive has gone into hiding and
now is finding different different
reasons too long in it they have made of
election manifesto is a push on you
police they're firing key have us job

absolutely expectedness pondered let's
quickly listen in to what his father
who's the leader of this agitation
Colonel Cairo Lehman best lie saying
yeah interestingly enough
saying that no stone pelting has taken
place and none of the protesters have
burnt any of any of the police vans
let's just listen in to what he's told
bomani a few minutes ago the fighting
peacock we dial work which is not

on Gore obrigada Broken Arrow crane that
was the Gujju leader
conocchia racing by slaw saying I had
asked my protesters to exercise
restraint but today is day 3 the
government is not fulfilling the promise
it made in its election manifesto which
is why these protests have turned
violent of course it's interesting to
note and we've just heard from Vijay
Besler who's gonna be / son saying then
it was the police that is provoking the
police that is firing upon protesters
the protesters are innocent and they are
not the ones who have burnt policeman
said if they have he has no proof of it
this is just the media spreading
well I don't know what he thinks the
media is spreading but those pictures
are on your screens right now
these are protesters who indoor pool
pelted stones first and the police burnt
these vehicles they're on your screens
right now I don't know if this is not
proof then what is proof why exactly has
this why exactly has this agitation
turned violent on day three is it
because the protesters feel that their
demands are not being heard by the
Rajasthan government perhaps let's see
let's just hope at least that it doesn't
go any further from where it stands
right now protests as I said turning
violent in the whirlpool this is one
story we continue to track right here on
CNN news 18
now to the other big story which is
developing in West Bengal where BJP
leader Mukul Roy has been named in the
murder fi are of Trinamool Congress MLAs
at the Jean Biswas viswas was shot dead
by unidentified assailants on Saturday
during a Saraswati puja celebration the
latest coming in on that story is that
the police has arrested two out of the
four cused who were named india fire
Mukul Roy has been named in the fi are
filed by the deceased mla's ate an
eyewitness Milan Saha the officer in
charge of the hunt sir Kali police
station under whose jurisdiction the
event was being organized has been
suspended while the TMC has blamed the
BJP the party has denied the charge and
blamed the existing fractional ISM in
the TMC as the reason for the Emily's
murder now he's been named as one of the
accused but BJP leader muckleroy is
saying he has nothing to do with the
murder listening
he has been brutally killed by some
miscreants I condemn it but BJP doesn't
believe in this type of politics but in
the entire state of his banal it is
going on when anybody is killed by their
own peoples or by other miscreants
Sunnah moon and the government tried to
implicate it the leaders and workers of
the BJP
I'm going straight across to Kramer
who's joining us on the story she's the
one tracking tracking all details and
developments a primer there are four
people who have been named in the FI our
two have been arrested one of them is
muckleroy do we see his arrest as well
is that a minute
right now CID is investigating the case
and since his name is there in the a
file they will have to look at all
angles to see on what basis
his name is there in da fire as an
accused of course there are other two
others who have been arrested and the
other one is not interested but the
police are questioning possible suspects
Somu code right here has lashed out
saying that his name in the f-fire could
be there but he has nothing to do with
this because he was in Kolkata at the
time of the incident blaming the TMC
passional ISM for the reason behind the
murder but as far as the arrest is
concerned she right now police are
looking at all possible angles and right
now we cannot really say whether all
right Thank You Prima for getting us
that quick update on the story meanwhile
Col Cara's Police Commissioner Rajeev
Kumar and former TMC MP Kunal Ghosh are
being questioned at the CBI headquarters
in Shillong and this is of course in
connection with the shara de chit fund
scam CBI sources are telling network 18
that Rajeev Kumar hid certain crucial
information and evidence on political
leaders involved in the scam sources are
also saying that Rajeev Kumar did not
hand over original proof to the central
agency and also deleted important
numbers from his call records now to the
story that is coming in from Jammu and
Kashmir and really is this an
unnecessary manufactured controversy
former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister
Mehbooba Mufti has parked of a row with
her latest tweet taking a jibe at the
Modi government Mehbooba Mufti has
tweeted and I quote the tweet is also on
your screens how times change the
centre's top priority is seemingly
renaming historic cities and building
the Ram Mandir on the other hand it's
heartening to see that Pakistan's prime
minister has initiated steps to name the
bulk way forest reserve after guru nanak
ji and create a university under
his name was theorized joining me on the
phone line
Mufti could you tell me what exactly the
controversy is about there's nothing
factually wrong in what may be one of
TSA the fact is that the Modi government
has changed names of historic cities a
prior garage al-abaad being a case in
point and the fact is that the
Pakistan's prime minister in Grand Khan
has named the bulk oil forest reserve
after guru nanak gee this is a factually
correct tweet where is the controversy I
think the controversy is really from the
BJP and other extremist outfits so
neither one of P in election season is
making the right noises she's suddenly
become pro-separatist pro-pakistan
and she's really hailed Imran Khan today
assumed office first when you offered
that I look to not in the Modi Prime and
Sarah pregnant and then during the
Kotaku then he reopened that Qatar pool
corridors thereafter this is the third
kind of a tweet when a below of he has
hailed Imran Khan but at the same time
really you know targeted the central
government dead binary in the morning
clearly this is an election season maqam
of tea is meeting right britches because
how constituency actually panders to
these kind of first slogans and because
as I said that this is an election
season perhaps she is trying to make the
law lost ground that she had while they
had a truck with BJP
people really being critical or some a
bomb of these PDP that it's bent along
with the defeat of foreign government
and which kind of you know had done
massive damage to PDT because it's
waters didn't like that idea and because
of those killings which took place post
per on filling amalgam of tea really in
in in a tight spot and now she's trying
to regain ground and once again you know
how too far she's using these the
pro-separatist control Pakistan
rhetorically okay okay move to believe
it there for the moment thank you very
much this is election season we'll see
more of that pro-separatist rhetoric
coming in from haboob amove T and we
also see more reactions coming in from
the BJP as well both have their own
narratives to play on for the moment
here's someone else who's who's getting
ready for the battle ahead Priyanka
Gandhi's entry into politics has been
marred by sexist comments being made by
BJP Anita's now the latest to join the
bandwagon is bJP MP Harish the ready
who said that Priyanka wears jeans and
tops when she's in Delhi but wears a
sari and applies and/or only while
visiting rural areas in Amity and ribéry
Li but this is not the first time that
Priyanka Gandhi has brought the brunt of
sexist comments earlier Bihar Minister
Vinod narayan jha had called Priyanka
Gandhi nothing more than a pretty face
that's not all senior BJP leader Kailash
vijayvargiya has said that the party was
fielding chocolatey faces in the Lok
Sabha polls as it has a dearth of strong
leaders who rebel yeah me gettin up top
a Mario rickety property Malaya Coco
dicen a year subbu Papa had the Priyanka
Gandhi development moving on after his
speech got interrupted at the ng MA

the controversy he narrated the incident

and finally enthusiastic people in
gurugram assembled at the leisure valley

edition of the marathon and it is
steadily gaining momentum every year

participation of professional runners

time I drank this much the response has
been incredible this year with about
20,000 people from all walks of life
different ages different backgrounds

delighted by the participation we
organized a marathon because we feel
then as a university we have to bring
the community together and send good
messages to society in the community so
to bring so many diverse people together
into one platform where people are
celebrating fitness health it is a
wonderful thing and at the same time we
have not only corporate teams that are
deeply involved here but also NGOs that
are pushing and creating awareness for
social causes
utilizing the marathon platform to raise
funds so as a whole it is a mega event
in which people are enjoying and at the

fitness and social causes the book story

close to a month now we can talk about

done hastily and the fallout has been

had ordered that all stray cattle be
taken to cow shelters by january 9th
the government has levied an additional
0.5% says on alcohol row tools and other
excise items to help fund cow shelters
but that money hasn't been enough to
fund the shortfall farmers are being
compelled to make donations to the
government and they're also pulling in
resources to feed the cattle already in

donations are critical as the 30 rupee

R5dzWDdyQLc,Off Centre: “I&#39;m Not Inclined To Contest In 2019” – Yogendra Yadav | Anuradha Sengupta,"As political parties get into campaign mode and confrontation becomes the name of the game, psephologist turned political ...",2019-02-09T11:36:19Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R5dzWDdyQLc/hqdefault.jpg,"[Music]
hello I'm Anya Radha's they looked at
and you've tuned into off-center
political parties are in confrontation
and campaign mode as we come down to the
next Lok Sabha elections in the middle
of everything else that's happening this
week a group of eminent citizens has
released a plan called reclaiming the
Republic yogi Narada the president of
the Swaraj India party is one of the
people behind the initiative he joins me
today to explain why this was launched
and also how it will impact all of us
you can rather thank you very much for
talking to us and I think before we try
and figure out how to reclaim the
Republic we need to assess the state of
the Republic we are meeting in a week
where mamta Banerjee is doing at her na
the Calcutta police have tried to stop
the cbi from doing its work the matter
is now in court central forces were
trying to protect the CBI is this a
crisis or is this really just political
drama as we get into elections every
drama tells you something much deeper
isn't it funny
Mamta benarjee trying to defend
democracy I'm go to West Bengal ask
people how are the panchayat elections
conducted there do you manage to hold
ordinary rallies which are not accepted
by mumtaz people locally you'll get to
see what's happening I think we're in a
deep crisis the crisis is that some of
the foundational values of our Republic
are under challenge like never before
and we cannot see one political party on
the horizon that can possibly defend it
on the one hand we have BJP in power
which to my mind has launched the
biggest possible onslaught on the three
foundations of our republic democracy
diversity and development for the last
person on the other hand you have this
opposition some kind of mahogany button
which keeps changing colours and
Composition every day which doesn't
stand for anything I don't know what
they stand for the to my mind the
question for election 2019 is not
whether Modi wins or loses of course he
loses the real question is not who after
him the real question is what
if these are the choices available
before you electorally what do you do
very tough choice so one thing is quite
clear
mr. Modi has to go at the same time he
cannot just go and leave a wide a vacuum
a bunch of politicians who are doing
nothing except calculating their seats
all the time whenever I speak to any of
them I see them speaking on television
the only thing is cowardice coalition
order guys Satanist what are you going
to do after that let's take a look at
the plan that has been put forward you
know called reclaiming reclaiming the
Republic when I go through some of the
points you know electoral reforms
judicial reforms police reforms there's
a great sense of oh I've heard this
before or I have read this before oh I
have seen this before why is this agenda
going to find any more takers today in
2019 then it has ever had before
you right for the last 70 years or so
some of the elementary things which were
written into our Constitution have never
been realized and the funny thing that
is that on most aspects of public policy
there are proposals which are just lying
somewhere for someone to just implement
on police reform for yeah but there's a
Supreme Court judgement that says the
following things have to be done they've
never been done no contempt in the
Supreme Court either but they are not
done so yes you have to reiterate some
of those old things but what we are
trying to do in this proposal I think
are three kinds of things one is simply
recovery because in the last four or
five years there'll be just so much of
onslaught just so much of misuse of
basics so it's almost like emergency
after emergency you needed a 44th
amendment to undo many of the eggs that
were done the many things that need to
be just undone that's one set of things
mostly to do with civil liberties mostly
to do with democratic institutions and
so on
second is ricans
that is to ensure that things like this
do not happen again media for example I
really think we need a First Amendment
equivalent in India something which
would really say protect because what we
have witnessed in the last few years
three four years media autonomous
institutions and every little
institution in the government you know
whether it's a Supreme Court or the CBI
CAG TV see every little autonomous nook
has been captured NSSO but you know the
most of faceless part of government
actually but it's something there should
have been proud of NSS so is something
which is quoted by economists all over
the world you know we may not have
eliminated poverty but we've measured
poverty better than anyone else our
statistical system has been in you know
something that we could take pride in
these are the institutions that have
been destroyed so so reclaim and then
reconstruct yeah so and the third is
reorient in some ways Republic has to
come back to its fundamental values we
promise nothing short of a welfare
democracy and some of those elementary
welfare things are not realized so the
attempt here is to say many of these
things are still doable it takes
political will to create a welfare state
and to address some of these basic
things so given that you want the
incumbent bjp-led government to go given
that you don't believe that the
coalition that the that the different
parties that are trying to form a sort
of coalition option is credible what is
the choice that you think citizens are
left with if they want to go to
reclaiming reconstructing and then
reorienting the indian republic one
option we do have is to try and force
all parties into accepting some of this
substantive agenda at the moment they
are a genderless but as we have
witnessed you know
Rahul Gandhi has said a couple of things
in the last few days which begins to
tell you what political compulsions can
produce I don't think the organdy was
talking of basic minimum income in the
past but he now is I don't think
Congress governments were very keen to
talk about farmer loan waiver earlier
yeah but now they are yeah so and it's a
bit of competition BJP says you know
brown Gandhi says minimum income
guarantee BJP says we'll give you the
point support and in politics sometimes
it is not your good intention it's not
your benevolence it is just your crass
desire to somehow win votes that people
need to be able to benefit from yeah and
that's something where ordinary people
can make a difference you know I keep
saying election is not a cricket match
between England in Australia where I
don't have a team I can just watch yeah
he's doing very well at our six-month do
is drop a catch this is my life this is
my country my future I cannot simply sit
on television and watch the results come
or I should not merely one day wake up
and push a button on a machine I need to
do much more than that and that is a
gender setting that's where citizens can
come and that's where we are investing
all our efforts yeah we've just started
a campaign called ICANN yes
Indian citizens action formation the
idea is that we're inviting citizens
from all over the country they don't
have to be member of my party or any
party for that matter it's interesting
to me that you're saying you know I can
nineteen is beyond Swaraj India which is
your party you did debut and contest the
MCD you know municipal elections in
Delhi in 2017 I know y'all did Karnataka
and in Rajasthan I think you contested
very minimally you see in these looks of
my elections that will come up
will there be Swaraj India candidates
how are you what I'm trying to get at is
what has been the experience of
electoral politics for your party the
experience has been that we are able to
shift the age
we are able to draw people's attention
to the real issues as you know for the
last three years our party and I in
particular have almost done nothing
except talk about farmers and yeah
unemployment issues so we've succeeded
in drawing public's attention to this
and in some way contribute to the big
agenda shift that has taken place but
we've not been able to draw people's
attention to ourselves why the work we
do why do you think that is and
therefore not be an electoral
alternative in however small or at
whatever level of Elections there must
be some limitation in our organization
in its leadership in people like me we
cannot run away from responsibility but
it's also a larger function of the rules
of the game today the rules of the game
are about money and I mean if you don't
have a few crore rupees to invest on
publicizing what you say you don't exist
earlier I used to say money and media
now it give me I have to say media I
mean is another way of talking about
money so actually it's money and money
and it's the this the minimum scale is
simply so high as to be almost
impossible but in the upcoming elections
are we expecting a certain number of
candidates even if it is a few seats do
we see that do we see you contesting you
know try and contest again no I'm not
inclined at all I'm not inclined to
contest personally I have two choices
either with the limited energy and
ability people like me can put all that
energy in one posture to ensue and try
and win the other would be to put that
energy on the issue of farmers for
example raising it at the national level
for rightly or wrongly we've decided to
put our energy on that issue in 2019 as
we countdown to the elections if you are
saying that you that there may be nobody
who contests on behalf of this Viraj
India party then
you know I'm and what I'm trying to say
is it seems almost like contradictory
the existence of this organization and
what it's meant to do and what it is
going to do a concrete plan for 2019 is
this that on behalf of this campaign I
can 19 we are searching for candidates
but these are not Swaraj india
candidates but they could be congress
candidates they could be BJP candidates
they could be op candidates they could
be independence though we know the fate
of independence is not terribly in a
positive simple we can't rule that out
but when you say people who really
represent these issues you that reduces
the likelihood of mainstream parties yes
it would look like a contradiction so
you have a party and you're not saying
I'm contesting these many seats because
basically to be a political party today
is to be an election machine yeah that's
what we've renamed political parties
remember only about 30 40 years ago
political parties were not supposed to
be just that yes political parties were
in movement more throughout five years
and a pressure group as well isn't it
so a party in a pressure group an NGO a
university and an ashram it has to be a
mix of all these things that's what we
are trying to build I know it looks
lunatic but it is taking four new forms
a 21st century democracy you know you
are not willing to give up on this quest
for a new form yet that's why we came
when you talk about assault on
institutions in the last five years
different or institutions at different
points have come to the you know have
been under attack so to say now I'm
interested in knowing your view about
the election commission because you know
there is a sense in India that whatever
else may be wrong with this country how
I work however corrupt we may be in many
different aspects of life or perhaps all
aspects of life the Election Commission
and the way elections are conducted and
results are counted we can put our faith
in that
and somehow that trust has been
undermined consistently in the past five
years where do you stand on that on this
EVM hacking issue on the fact that EVMS
are being manipulated let me put it
honestly I'm not one of the EVM skeptics
okay I do not believe this might look
odd and I have not been able to convince
some of my closest friends not even
Prashanti but I think BJP won in the
last three elections because people
voted for it brahmam broadly it is true
that EVM in principle can be hacked like
any software can be any any electronic
device can be it is true that mr. Modi
and Shah would leave no stone unturned
and would not allow any compunction to
come in their way to win elections they
can do anything
it is also sadly true that the Election
Commission of India is not the kind of
institution that it used to be five six
years ago
and but yet you had last three elections
you know in December 2018 that did not
go to the BJP so one thing is that it is
all these three things are true but from
that to conclude that elections have
been manipulated and that BJP has won
the few elections because of IBM is it
wrong conclusion because why in
principle it can be the case the
administrative procedural protocol is
just too elaborate for them to be able
to do so and let me put it this way so
far I have not seen a convincing
evidence of any serious manipulation
actually have been taking place on the
ground someone needs to say look at this
booth this is what happened this does
not match I have not seen evidence of
that kind and in any case now we have a
solution we can just deliver all this
debate aside and Vivek pad is a decent
solution the Election Commission has
committed to the Supreme Court that they
would go for wee-wee pad in every single
booth all we need to do and here is my
proposal before you start counting on
every counting table they are usually
DNA of our constituency for some reason
don't ask me why they're 14 tables no
matter what the number of the boots is
on every table by lottery bring one
machine and actually physically count
the purchase with the electronic count
if all the sporting put together show a
discrepancy of less than 0.5% 0.1 I mean
ideally there should be zero zero but
you know allow for an error and say 0.1
percent then do your normal regular
count but if that does not match if it
crosses a certain threshold then for
every single booth open the machine do
physical count of purchase that should
put this debate to rest I mean we will
be too far in our democratic history to
get into this kind of silly a bit today
so you're saying that if this proposal
is something that people accept and by
that I mean political parties it would
offer some kind of closure to what I
feel is a very damaging debate to my
mind the entire thing has been generated
not so much by evidence on the ground
but by legitimate apprehensions about
the political establishment which can do
anything and because of election
commission that looks more pliable then
has ever been the case in the last 30
years these are very sad facts and yet
the Election Commission has also I mean
look at the Gujarat you know the rajasah
by-elections at that time it did behave
independently of the very fact that you
have to pick an instance and say
Election Commission didn't behave
independently I mean it tells the story
so you know electric Commission is about
to announce the election scheduled for
three states which would mean immediate
implementation of model code of conduct
then they realize that mr. Modi has a
reality in the election commission
postponed by four hours I mean what kind
of a message does it give you this is so
embarrassing you're saying if we are in
a situation where I have to give one
instance and you have to we have to keep
pulling out instances to make a case
then the institution is has been
undermined and just
look at how many institutions have
undergone through this over the last few
years some that we can name because some
protests took place Supreme Court we can
name because four judges came out
CBI we can name because a personal
conflict became into a larger thing but
there are institutions that we cannot
name because you know everything that
the regime wanted to happen is happening
smoothly
CAG CVC which institution which
independent institution is left in this
country and how can democracy function
without some autonomy some independence
I mean how can even rulers survive I
really pity these rulers because clearly
no one is telling them the truth it's
possible that mr. Morton is actually
living in the belief that there is no
unemployment in this country because no
one has the guts and courage to simply
go and tell him look boss this is the
worst situation in the last 50 years so
initially you destroy these institutions
so as to deny your opponents a chance
but at some time this begins to bite you
and mr. Modi like me this happened to me
in Raggedy during emergency no one told
her what was happening outside I think
this is happening to mr. Modi no one
tells him what is the truth I want to
get your reaction to the interim budget
especially the announcement on
agriculture because of the fact that you
have made that you're you know both
personally professionally for your
organization the cause of farmers has
been put front and center and agrarian
distress is sort of the centerpiece of a
whole lot of things that have you know
had a ripple effect on in Indian economy
and therefore society what did you make
of that six thousand rupee or your
income support to farmers who have land
that's less than two hectares it's
illegitimate it's token and it's cynical
it's alleged to me because you cannot
present this six budget in five years
yeah it is very dodo do they they did
say that that would start from December
retrospectively December 2018 is the
cynical part is the delicate on the
month of February you suddenly feel so
concerned about farmers that you bring a
change in previous year's budget
allocations to allow it from December so
what's happening really basically what's
being done is to say you'll get it two
thousand rupee contribution to your bank
account
please remember common capital that's
basically what's happening just before
model code of conduct kicks normally all
the budgetary announcements take effect
from 1st of March this one is an
exception so basically it's a crass
brazen political deal and the trouble
with the deal is that it's very cheap
it's two thousand rupees for four or
five votes in one in stallin to think of
six thousand rupees if someone said of
this as a marginal scheme I would
welcome it but if someone says this
would help the Indian farmers raise
their income and they don't even have to
go to moneylender these are the things
the finance minister said this is a joke
the farm you know if you look at it for
a five acre farmer this translates into
thousand two hundred rupees per acre for
two crops for one crop the subsidies six
hundred rupees you can't even fill a
practice tank even once with that amount
you can't even put a potassium urea in
the field for that but having said all
this I think there's one unintended
consequence which is this that till last
week the Union agriculture budget used
to be about 2.2 percent of the overall
Union budget this was the same with UPA
the same with nd no matter who claims
what suddenly because of this completely
cynical short-sighted move he's been
jacked-up 25.5% no union government will
have the guts to take it to take it down
that's what I celebrate that in this
competition in their mutual competition
they've ended up doing something with in
the long run good people of benefit but
as a cynical are usually thing cynical
by calling it an unintended consequence
because if it was intended they should
have brought it in the fourth or the
fifth budget at least it would have gone
from their pocket it is unintended
because the whole point is I don't have
to pay it someone else will pay it
that's not done you can't do these
things
final question when you look at
reclaiming the Republic what is the you
know I think there's a point that you're
trying to make about secularism and
democracy being redefined and perhaps re
understood in the in that context what
is it and how do you think public debate
should should follow the the unpleasant
truth is that there are very few
defenders of genuine secularism in the
country and the liberal secular elite
anglicized westernized D resonating
completely did legitimized it in the
eyes of ordinary people in ordinary
believing in or a believing Muslim or
believing six they don't care for this
thing called secularism and the trouble
is secularism is not an optional thing
in India you either have a secular India
or you have no India at all so someone
has to reimagine secularism in popular
language in people's Pasha's in a
metaphor that they understand for a
believing Hindu and a believing Muslim
believing second Christians we have to
represent secularism and the idea of
democracy that democracy is something
sacred much more than an effective
government is something we need to
create and in order to create you need
political actors who can speak
consistently about it when Congress
wants to be champion of
well democracy you remember emergency
when Mamata Banerjee talks about this
you remember what she does that you know
in our own backyard you need to be
consistent about these things and one of
the proposals in this reclaiming the
Republic document is that some of the
key institutions of democracy should be
insulated from government similarly some
of the autonomy given by the
Constitution has to be restored to the
engine to the institutions and given
further support so that something like
this does not happen again you know
do not be sure that the next government
would not want to use the CBI exactly
the way this fragmented or hasn't in the
past in the past to my mind it is about
defending India's swadharma so Herman
not in the sense of a religion of the
last 5,000 years India swirled Hermes
democracy diversity and development for
the last person this is a swather you
can every other thank you very much all
good luck as usual thank you

we turn our attention to the big story
which is the rough aisle controversy
there is another mother of all
controversies which is now broken out
and that's unfolding in the state of
West Bengal it's an all-out war now
frankly which is unfolding in the state
of West Bengal in DB land just look at
what's happening cops in West Bengal are
now busy raiding premises of those
commercial organizations those companies
which supposedly are linked to the
interim CBI chief mr. Nageshwar Rao what
is being alleged by the caja was
involved in some kind of a commercial
transaction with a company called angelo
mercantile Private Limited mr. Rao is
openly saying that there is nothing
wrong with what his wife had done some
of 25lakhs had been exchanged between
Nageshwara wife and this private limited
company which is based in Kolkata
Nageshwar Rao says that the sum of 25
lakhs has been returned to this company
and he is openly alleging propaganda and
vendetta and all this is coming exactly
a day before the CBI officers end up
interrogating and questioning the chief
of Kolkata Police mr. Rajeev Kumar what
does one make out what does one make out
of all this that's happening is this a
straight forward battle which is taking
place between Kolkata cops on one side
and the CBI on the other shoukata
Mukhopadhyay is joining us live from
Kolkata so rather once is going on
CBI versus Kolkata Police exactly a day
before Rajeev Kumar should be questioned
well like you pointed out it's an
all-out battle between a full-blown war
between the CBI and the Kolkata Police
you know essentially the idea is that
there is dirt underneath every carpet
and if you if you pull my rug I will you
know go and pull your rug as well and
that is what's exactly happening the the
Kolkata Police is now raiding has now
raided the offices two offices in fact
one in Salt Lake and other in central
pool cata of a certain ampl D and Angela
mercantile Private Limited a non banking
financial company which supposedly in
the year 2010-2011 lent 25 lakh rupees
to him Sandhya the wife of a former CBI
director or interim director Nageshwar
Rao and and the and the and the and the
transactions between the the the Rao
family and and and where apparently
Nageshwar all's daughter is also
involved because apparently there are
evidences and that's what the police
claim that they have evidence so what I
want to know how is it that all this
evidence shava - is being discovered by
the Kolkata cops exactly a day before
the CBI was to question Rajeev Kumar is
there a link between these two events
well I'll tell you this the day Mamata
Banerjee withdrew her you know Donna
from from the Kolkata from from
tarantella was the day when the Kolkata
police turned up at the house or one of
the offices in Salt Lake of am/pm that
was the day when when pol cotta police
first raided that house
obviously these are you know it's it's
it's it's a very very strange
coincidence if at all it is one that
that poor car the police chose this very
time when when when there is this this
this war between the CBI and the Kolkata
Police currently going on when Rajeev
Kumar is being someone to to Shillong to
to be examined by the CBI in the you
know a bit over his role in the
investigation of the Charlotte front
case so obviously you know you know it's
it's it's a very very strange
coincidence like I said if at all it is
one okay similarly it was also a very
very strange coincidence that the CBI
after all these years you know found
evidence against Rajeev Kumar right
before the elections you know the the
CBI took over the investigations of the
of the shahrullah chit fund scam well
you know back when trauma to the truth
is over the truth is that these
procedures see they found these aren't
these are unprecedented scenes that
we're seeing unfold right now in in the
state of West Bengal
let me thanks I've got the macabre then
let me get quick responses from our
political guests origin joining us live
tonight Pawan Kalyan spokesperson of the
Congress party is there a myth Baloo a

breakdown of the system of law and order
management and policing obviously both
the Kolkata police and CBI are arraigned
against each other and the timing of
course can be questioned by everyone on
upon a Sunday if you land up with 40
officers when you had the information
and the process is on for a long time
then people are bound to question and
similarly about the Kolkata Police which
is which is doing what it is doing right
now so I'm afraid that this is going to
continue
it's what am I to understand are you
saying so are you saying said that
Kolkata cops are basically paying back
the CBI in the same coin is that what's
happening the state of West Bengal today
well obviously you know there is no
smoke without fire or there has to be
some grain of truth in what is happening
but the timing of course shows that they
are there they are very least wrongly
arraigned against each other and would
do anything to commit well yeah I mean
Bobby where does this leave us
I miss Bobby where does this leave us
the west wing wall chief furnace I said
I don't trust the CBI I don't want the
investigations to be done by CBI
now I'm seeing a day before the CBI was
to question Rajeev Kumar the Kolkata
Police Commissioner rung eeshwar Rao
himself now comes under scanner how do
you move forward on a myth Malviya you
know I hold no brief for mr. Nageshwar
Rao he I'm sure can defend himself but
as far as the CBI is concerned and as
far as the shard the scam is concerned
and the Rose Valley chit fund scam is
concerned the CBI is going to do what is
mandated and expected of them under law
Mamata Banerjee is not a loan to herself
and Bengal is not a Federal Republic it
is very much a part of the Indian state
and it will have to abide by and operate
under the Indian Constitution it will
have to abide by Indian Constitution
Pawan Keira is constitutionally
respected here where
Kolkata table suddenly land up and try
looking for links against the wife of
the interim CBI chief former interim CBI
chief his Constitution being respected
they're born Kira tell me the Supreme
Court came down heavily on Naga sure off
a contempt of court on the Bihar shelter
home abuse case Nagesh arouse
credentials are heavily tainted there
was a reason why he was handpicked by
the prime minister and put in place of
Allah Varma
in the midnight coup who trusts the CBI
anymore it is the onus to restore the
credibility of CBI lies with the
government which misused is so much that
nobody trusts rate anymore so the
collapse of these institutions the onus
lies on the doorstep of mr. Narendra
Modi and mr. Ajit Doval the PMO
interferes in almost everything so
you're saying the BJP you're saying the
Prime Minister responsible for what's
going on in the state of West Bengal PO
ng for what's going on in CBI first of
all you can't just go and do a midnight
knock at an officer's house without
proper documentation and then expect
everybody else to behave I mean while we
are therefore never say the witness has
an accurate Malviya all that's happening
is that Kolkata cops are giving it back
to the CBI in the same coin my worry is
if cops CBI also consists of cops
Kolkata Police cops that's bullies if
cops start fighting with each other like
this I mean are we talking about police
war sure are we talking about a fight
between Trinamool Congress and the BJP
surely Kolkata police should not
represent only Trinamool Congress and
surely the CBI should not represent the
BJP with Malviya that's a good point
the group in the only time in recent
years the CBI was compromised when the
supreme court called it the Caged perish
and that was under the UPA the then CBI
chief ranjeet's and I was also in his
lot of facing a case in the Colgate
corruption scandal so let the Congress
not preach to us on how to run
institutions and how to keep this entity
as far as what
not running you're really just a
personal matter as it seems from what is
coming out of Naga Sadow and his family
we have nothing to say on it but as far
as the saga Valley and the Rose Valley
chip scam are concerned the West Bengal
government and the officials who were
heading the SI t at that point in time
and if required the leader of the TMC
will have to answer the CBI because that
is the law of the land and they are not
above it let's stick to the law of the
land question let's move on then from
the state of West Bengal and let's come
back to Delhi and let's look at what's
going on in Delhi there in West Bengal
law and order enforcing agency certainly
seem to be at loggerheads with each
other and here in the national capital
what's happening the principal
opposition party is accusing the party
which is in power of being guilty of
being guilty of not maintaining the
sanctity of institutions of basically
lying before Parliament what's happened
today is this folks in the Hindu
newspaper an article gets published and
that article basically makes this point
that there is something sinister there
is something sinister about the entire
defile saga let's call it the big three
R factor or a file drawer Rahul Gandhi
uses that newspaper article to build
this case a Prime Minister Modi the NDA
government had not been telling us the
exact picture as far as that a file deed
is concerned because suddenly the
Congress Party which was quoting a note
which suggested that the Prime
Minister's office was conducting
parallel negotiations with the French
government while the Defense Ministry on
its own was trying to negotiate with
them may well have ended up compromising
the negotiations and immediately after
all Gandhi started flashing that note
which had been published in the
newspaper Nirmala Sitharaman the BJP hit
back and they produced the full version
of that note in a sense it becomes a
half note versus full note battle whose
note do you believe I say you can't
believe cops and CBI in the state of
West Bengal you can't believe notes
today which are being leaked by all
sides in this country who do we believe

lVcq0CyNCI8,Will The Rafale Deal Dominate The Lok Sabha Poll Agenda? | Faceoff With Zakka Jacob,RafaleDeal #RahulGandhi #NarendraModi How much protocol was broken in the Rafale deal? It was always clear that Prime ...,2019-02-08T16:30:01Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lVcq0CyNCI8/hqdefault.jpg,"let's now shift focus away from that
breaking story to the big story that
we're tracking here on face off tonight
raphaelle politics continues to peak
ahead of the looks of my elections and
there is seemingly no end in sight today
in Parliament there was a small note
which appeared in the Hindu newspaper
which sparked off a major firestorm this
media report which came out after which
Rahul Gandhi went all guns blazing at
the central government saying that the
Prime Minister's office had deliberately
weakened the raffle negotiations with
France because there were parallel
negotiations that the PMO and PM
officials were undertaking at the same
time that a Modi Ministry of Defense
officials were were were indulged in
those negotiations with the French side
raksha mantri Nirmala Sitharaman hit
right back at Rahul Gandhi saying that
the Prime Minister's office or officials
there in asking queries on the progress
of a particular defense deal does not
amount to interference it certainly does
not amount to a parallel negotiation the
former defense secretary Mohan Kumar who
was quoted in this particular media
report contradicted what was mentioned
in that report Mohan Kumar said that the
Prime Minister's Office or officials
there did not intervene in the pricing
negotiations but on the issue of
sovereign guarantee so the question
we're asking tonight on face off is this
there's been a Supreme Court verdict on
the raffle matter and yet raffle simply
refuses to go away from the public
consciousness has Rahul Gandhi jumped
the gun on raffle because the other
important bit that came out and we'll
play that out in just a second is that
that same defense note which was
accessed by the the former editor of the
Hindu newspaper who's under whose byline
this article has been published that
particular note also had a section where
there were there was a handwritten
filing noting by the den Raksha mantra
Manohar Parrikar in which he called this
an overreaction let's first listen in to
the war of words between Rahul Gandhi
and Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman
they'll open and shut that the defense
ministry itself is saying that the Prime
Minister is conducting parallel
negotiation defense ministry never sabot
kar di ki jo : Janica haka was touched

both dangerous spot
here's the thing there are three people
quoted in that particular report two of
those three people have come out and
clarified that that's not what was
intended or that's not what was said in
that note one of them is the former
defense secretary Mohan Kumar he was
quoted in this particular report he came
out and cleared the air and he said
categorically to CNN news 18
that PM officials did not interfere in
the pricing negotiations apportionment
is absorb use the early dealing with
their share and another party control
hours come into question either
authenticated our document by having the
full page color not work they'll not
release the other pages a Billy Graham
just landed in floor it's authenticated
and please note the date of particles
noting it's in January and an emergent
matter the original not invited and
Secretary was in November saying the
their earlier more appears to be
monitoring it's not monitoring its
parallel negotiated
alright let me now play out for our
viewers what is the the actual position
that is that was mentioned in the Hindu
report and what is the counter that's
been put forth by the government after
the Hindu report of course the Congress
president Rahul Gandhi came out and
attacked the government saying that they
were parallel negotiations by the prime
minister's office that was the
allegation or that was the charge the
political charge that was made in that
media report as well as Rahul Gandhi of
course in that press conference this
morning the defense ministers counter to
that what these were simply queries this
was monitoring of the progress of the
deal and that certainly cannot be
categorized as interference in the
negotiations to this internal defence
note which was signed off by mr. SK
Sharma was a senior bureaucrat in the
air headquarters it says that the inner
our Gandhi went on to say today that the
internal letter exposes that there was
quote-unquote a parallel negotiation by
the Prime Minister's office and there
was a direct intervention by the Prime
Minister himself to get the off set
contract to quote/unquote his friend on
in a body the defence ministers
clarification to that was that the
government has answered every single
question on Rafael both inside and
outside of parliament the Congress
president's number three charge was that
the parallel discussions with certain
officials in the PMO at that time
according to him were having was
weakening the hand of the price
negotiating team the negotiating team
which comprises of a Modi as well as
their headquarters officials that was
being undermined their position and
their negotiation was being undermined
because PMO officials were also having a
parallel negotiation the rock shaman 3
has said that the media report has
selectively quoted only one portion of
that defence note and the latter portion
of that defence note has a handwritten
filing noting by the den rock shaman 3
Manohar Parrikar saying that this is
simply the Prime Minister's Office
monitoring the progress of this deal and
this was agreed to in the summit meeting
and this in mr. Parrikar's words was
simply an over reaction let me let me do
this
set the ball rolling now on what is
going to be an interesting discussion
because Rafael as much as you know one
would say about the Supreme Court
verdict and and one would have imagined
that after the Supreme Court verdict the
story would have died a natural death
but it certainly hasn't either inside
Parliament or outside we're joined here
in our studios by particular Penn
geopolitical and traditionalists Sudan
Xu Mittal is senior leader of the BJP
Sanjay Jha spokesperson of the Congress
we are hoping to be joined by two very
important people a Marshal retired SBP
Sinha was deputy head chief he was also
the lead negotiator in that same
committee we're in this defense note was
reportedly sent from as well as their
marshal PK Barbara who was also a former
vice chief of the Indian Air Force let
me start with with mr. Mittal mr. Mittal
the Hindu report I'm sure you've seen it
it's been all over the the internet as
well today in Enron's words both in the
article as well as in the conversation
that I had with him subsequently he is
dead sure in his piece that this was a
parallel negotiation he has named
certain PMO officials as well and he
says that it was worded as a parallel
negotiation in the defence no that was
sent by this committee to the PMO
the action of mr. n Romney lacks
credibility lacks sincerity and lacks
honesty why and when I say this I have
reasons why for the simple reason that
if mr. Romm had access to the note he
should have published the entire note to
select a space from the note to
construct the note in a manner which is
completely fallacious and untrue speaks
volumes of his intent and I'm surprised
that a person of the standing of enron
should have stoop so low
okay what was said there's a
clarification there there's a
clarification there I spoke to ROM one
second one second there's a
clarification it's an important point I
spoke to Rahm and I want to play out
that portion I asked him why did you
leave out the portion where mr. Parrikar
made this file noting and he said look
at the dates and I'll play this out look
at the dates the note was initially sent
in November mr. Pett occurs while noting
was made in January so it's very much
possible that the note that was made
available to mr. Raum by his sauce /
sources was between November and January
which did not have mr. Parrikar's file
noting can I ask my producer to cue up
that bite to up that portion of the
interview will try and play that out
okay give me 30 seconds and I'll play
that out mr. Romm has not taken a
position in that interview he said I may
or may not have had the file noting but
it is very much possible that between
November and January when there was no
file noting the file noting only
happened in January the document that
was given to mr. Romm by his source or
sources could have very well been the
one before January I'm going to play
that out it's it's it's Jacob before
assuming the know before assuming this
before assuming this round should have
clarified then here is he saying merrily
know he has it say either yes
he has he has he has yeah I'm going to
ask my producers to queue that up and
play it out this is n ROM the former
editor of The Hindu this is the second
okay we wake you that up but but but the
great that this is mr. Rams position
I'll play that out in just one second
but is it possible that the document
that was made available to him did not
have this noting because there were two
months between the note and mr. mr.
Perico has filed noting suck or
something which is published in 2019
something which is published in 2019 and
he didn't have access to something which
was written back in 2016 it's a little
surprising so I think what's gonna
happen there would be a lot of this
doubting Thomases and conspiracy
theories theorists coming up with the
stories half biggest stories till that
time run-up to the election but let us
look at the context of what happened
here was a deal which was hanging in
balance for three years and the contract
negotiation committee could not reach
anywhere forget about a sovereign
guaranteed the saw made it very clear if
the place were to be manufactured by HAL
they won't even take the guarantee of
the quality of the plate you can't you
can't just brush away the sovereign no
that's what I'm saying once again once
again we're also getting in an important
player in this negotiation I'll try and
seat him just in one second but let's
play out that drum chunk we've got that
chunk now this is n ROM the the person
who wrote the story I asked him
specifically why is it that you omitted
the portion where the rock shaman 3.then
rock shaman three had made a file noting
saying that this is an overreaction this
is his response
Claire that is a function because that's
all these attributes purely dealing with
the area and another particles role
hours come into question either
authenticated our document by having the
full page currently not they'll not
release the other pages are delete could
I just landed in the clue it's
authenticated and please note the date
of particles noting it's in January and
an emergent matter the original not
invited and Secretary was in November
saying the there earlier more appears to
be monitoring it's not monitoring its
parallel negotiated alright I'm joined
here in the studios by a Marshal retired
SPP Sinha he was the lead negotiator of
that committee first of all were you
surprised that you saw a story like this
were you aware of such a note that was
prepared were you in the know was any
member of the committee alerted about
this concern that has been raised this
issue was not discussed in the Indian
negotiating team I saw this mode for the
first time in the in the newspaper
article this morning this morning you
have now you not seen this notice paper
before the Indian negotiating team did
all the negotiations from the building
of a headquarter and all the
documentation of the Indian negotiating
team is in the files of eret quarter
okay and the secretarial support was
provided by my office okay
and this is an internal noting of mo D
okay which has been initiated by Deputy
Secretary err - yes who does not have a
locust and I in this entire procurement
case because you why do you say he
doesn't he was not part of the Indian
negotiating team we were seven members I
was the team leader I was a chairman and
we had one Air Force air vice-marshal
and we have five joint secretary from
imodium OD finance and Department of
Defense production were you or any of
the members of the team alerted to or
aware of the concerns raised by either
this gentleman or concerns raised by
anybody else in a body on this honestly
the biggest evidence of no concerns
being projected by anybody is that such
a serious issue
has been put on MOT files and nobody in
the mo D right up to the rock shaman
three ever brought it to the notice of
Indian negotiating team or discussed it
with us okay so you or the other six
members or seven members of that
committee were completely unaware of
concerns that might have existed no [ __ ]
D it's on prize whether it's on parallel
joint secretary and a mare yes who was a
member of my coming yes is a signatory
to that note yeah so he was aware but it
was an issue which was internal to a
Modi and not but he did not either alert
you or any other member of all meetings
have minutes prepared yes and surely if
this was an issue it would have been
part of the minutes of the meetings and
and this is not part of the minutes of
any of the meetings that that we are
your committee had okay Sanjay Jha now
respond I have the lead negotiator of
the Indian negotiating team in the
Rafael matter he is saying neither he
nor any members of this team were
alerted to this the minutes of their
meetings various meetings I'm sure you
would have had hundreds of meetings over
the over the number of years you had to
negotiate this ain't none of the minutes
of the meeting does such a document
appear in fact the lead negotiator the
first time he's seeing this document is
is in this morning's Hindu
so is he trying to make an allegation
that this document is a fake document
why don't we just clear this out first I
mean let's let's bite the bullet
this is documentary evidence sucka let's
not try and you know pussyfoot around
this issue firstly he admits this is a
serious document well if this is a
serious document then let then let us
accept it that this is facts these are
signatures and by the way the government
of the day has already responded by
saying that there was a notation made by
mr. particle earlier so it is not a fake
document now let me make three very
quick points and then we can debate it
further number one it is on record by
the different secretary that their word
parallel negotiations going on this is
not mr. Rahul Gandhi's words this is the
word of the defence secretary of India
point number two very critical and your
viewers need to know this it says that
the PMO that is Narendra Modi's office
is taking steps which are contradictory
now this is the most critical term in my
opinion zakah it says this contradictory
to the views of the Ministry of Defence
what does that mean you think this is
not a serious allegation point number
three it also says that the PMO's
intervention is undermining the
authority of the Ministry of Defense
another critical point that has to be
germane Indian investigation
that will have to do last point very
critical it even says that if the PMO
has no confidence then why not just
reframe the modalities and let the PMO
have the final call it is actually a
protest note this is what is called as a
protest no no no no no what particle
issues before we get to the body core
issue once again we get two body got it
one second but use it has no answers my
question son yes why Sanjay Sanjay
you've still not answered my question so
I'm not doubting the authenticity of the
document or anything I'm not taking a
position here I'm presenting to you the
lead negotiator of the Indian
negotiating side on the raphaël matter
and he is saying that he has not seen
such a document he was not made aware of
nor alerted to the concern
spread in this letter well let me tell
you I don't listen listen to me
sucka let's be very clear he is a lead
negotiator I think we all nobody here is
denying that this document - is a
reality and easy denying it or not let's
let's have less ok let's say just like
don't you make why he doesn't know I'm
asking him exists that then okay let me
ask you please do us you ask is this
document fake does it appear fake to you
or does it appear genuine you see it is
not my job to you know prove the
authenticity of her document okay what
is important is that when the Indian
negotiating team has been formed by the
government it was the responsibility of
the Indian negotiating team to negotiate
yes and I stand by every word which is
there in the inter governmental
agreement it has been done by a team of
seven of us jointly in participation
with the French negotiating team you are
unaware of any I am coming I am coming
to that there has been no parallel
negotiation that we in the Indian
negotiating team were aware of okay and
this note of a Modi itself is the
greatest evidence that somebody had made
allegation who was not part of the out
of these four signatories the Deputy
Secretary was not part of the
negotiating team the DG equation was not
part of the negotiating team the
different secretary was not part of the
negotiating team okay the very fact that
all these people have created this note
as an internal issue and never discussed
with the Indian negotiating team itself
is an evidence that nobody ever
interfered with what the Indian
negotiating team did but but if I may
ask I mean how long were you heading
this team and how long were you part of
the the leading I was heading the
negotiating team till 30th of December
2015
okay this is from the time it was formed
in May so it's it's it's a good six
months seven months
correct okay it's about six seven months
in those six seven months you you have
you you were not aware of slash alerted
to by anybody either in air headquarters
or in or any Modi about these
quote-unquote parallel negotiations that
were going on no no but the point is
nobody ever spoke to the Indian
negotiators either from a Modi or from
any other nobody nobody did okay this
note itself is an evidence that while it
is on record even then they did not
discuss anything with us okay I mean
it's bizarre Sanjay I mean if a Modi
officials and then yeah I'm coming to
mr. Mittal oh I think I think Sanjay
needs to respond how is it that these
what is these honorable gentlemen whose
signatures are there in this letter
never alerted or made the negotiating
team aware of what the the other side
that was happening the other parallel
negotiation that was happening
well Zakaria isn't it very interesting
this is why you need a jpc investigation
into this massive scam the Supreme Court
can't do it and let me tell you as I
have full respect for the gentleman
who's representing who was the chief
negotiator but he he apparently was
there till December 2015 this this
document is in November 24 so if he
doesn't know it I have no idea I don't
know how the bureaucracy works but
clearly there are problems within the
Indian bureaucracy around the time when
this Ravel's deal was signed but one
thing is incontrovertible Narendra
Modi's government lied to the Supreme
Court of India it's a contempt of court
because they said PMO was not involved
and this document clearly says so it so
neatly says so got choked up the rhyme
ministers office was running a
transaction with ROH fan I think this is
a scam of epic proportions okay we will
investigate there are specific eight
this officials one gave of this document
and so far nobody in government has come
out and said that this document is fake
they've said only selective portions
have been quoted but nobody has said
that this document is fake
Sokka this is a diabolic endeavor by the
conquer Congress to undermine the
sovereignty of this country the
integrity of the Armed Forces to
demoralize the Armed Forces and to
perpetrate falsehood now as I pointed
out you have to read the entire note and
all would you just shut up mr. Scindia
you behave yourself I did not intervene
its panic if you have courage running
listen to me if you have the courage
because you have no I'm not panicking
I'm talking on logic
do you have the courage to listen to me
then we're all listening to you let's
let's argue on merit please yes look at
look at the entire conduct Sokka Sokka
look at the entire conduct you
selectively pick up four paragraphs of
the note without giving the proceeding
north or the subsequent note is this not
a conspiracy is this not a dialogue a
diabolic attempt to undermine the entire
confidence of the people the who is
deliberately suppressing facts who is
plotting this conspiracy
allow me mister I am charging mr. Raum i
am charging mr. Raum and the way Rahul
Gandhi has acted in this nightmare
matter speaks volumes of the can't ever
be the conduct which is beneath contempt
chalk in archery yet not mr. Ehrlich
aware chalica what is a chalk you got to
retire Prime Minister do I apply
personally mr. Prime Minister cacao dos
Catania lickin sanity scan done all what
they're trying to do is perpetrate lies
by deliberately and in a diabolic
fashion to spin the facts to suit
conveniences
okay okay no no Marshall here okay let
me let me come back to my studio gasps
it is very much possible that once again
it's very much possible once again
Sanjay once again once again it's very
much possible that I much
Sina was not alerted to slash unaware of
this particular document or this
conversation that was happening between
certain mo D officials and certain p.m.
officials it's it's completely possible
and it's completely plausible if it
indeed was true because nobody has come
out and said - this document is fake if
there were these parallel conversations
that were happening between mo D
officials and p.m. officials and mo d
officials had raised the flag on
so-called parallel negotiations that
p.m. officials were having with the
French does that undermine mr shields
position and his negotiating teams
position I think Xhaka what the defense
minister Parrikar that time stated that
it is merely monitoring of the process
and not any kind of an interference that
you know the settles our matter
completely because fora devotions the
what is the difference how kids are yeah
how does one qualify it is monitoring
and not is a negotiation tell me there
is a deal going on for three years so
hanging and boiled balance didn't reach
anywhere the saw had serious
reservations of Hal Air Force planes
fleets were depleting what was the Prime
Minister supposed to do sit quietly and
do nothing I mean where is the scam in
it and if that associatio geezer is a
regular feature in a special I mean is
monitoring by PMO officials a regular
affair and big defense deals see there
was no monitoring monitoring by the
different secretaries keeps presenting
the various status of Ministry of
difference to the PMO on various issues
so it's not it's not an unusual or an
extraordinary thing no this is the only
thing that is prepared by the ministry
and sent to the PMO and Air Force does
not send anything directly to the PM and
if a force has any communication to be
sent then it's obviously routed through
there
everything goes through the Ministry of
difference Sanjay Sanjay
Sokka Sokka is very interesting look at
in fact I think Manohar Parrikar indict
cinerender Modi very directly look at
what is written
defense secretary may resolve the matter
a defense secretary may resolve the
matter in consultation with the
principal secretary to the Prime
Minister this is more than monitoring
this is looking at a resolution but I
tell you what is the most intriguing
part that many people seem to have
missed out that the Ministry of Defence
figured out about the issue of sovereign
and bank guarantees not on its own not
from the Narendra Modi government but
when the French investor engine ago she
ating team when the head of the French
in a ghost shooting team would wrote to
the Government of India
that's discovered that the government
are you scared of being exposed are you
scared of being exposed where is that
mentioned that the sovereign guarantee
was dilute all well let me tell you let
me tell you kindly read the entire
article already in India by Hindu Coates
that letter in fact is already on record
now let me tell you sucka why would the
government this is the movie once again
once again bank guarantees do you think
the Hindu articles once again sir so
once it's my
one second one second let's let's not
get ahead of P simply says there was
communication between certain PMO
officials and certain mo D officials
there were queries raised about the
sovereign guarantee and a manner of of
imposition of that sovereign guarantee
the peace does not cite any document
where this is specifically mentioned it
does mention there were conversations
the names of if Sir it's his turn it
sister marshals know the normal most of
the contracts are done by government of
India with vendors okay so you take a
bank guarantee yeah it is looking to
buying a house you pay an advance before
you do the booking okay so whatever
advances you pay you take a back
guarantee of equivalent value yes yes so
this is basically to assure your
interests okay ensure your interest yes
but when you do deals with governments
you do not seek bank guarantee you seek
assurance of the government and thus far
the only government to government deals
that India has done which is us through
the FMS route and through Russia and
none of them you either have a bank
guarantee or a sovereign guarantee you
have letters of assurance of the
government and so was this you can call
it a letter of assurance you can call it
a letter of comfort and for your benefit
and the benefit of all the viewers I
would read out what Paris 72 of DPP 2013
under which this procurement was done
okay it reads I am reading from the
middle such an intergovernmental
agreement is expected to safeguard the
interests of the Government of India and
should also provide for assistance of
the
foreign government in case the contract
runs into an unforeseen problem which
the French government has assured in
writing the terminology letter of
comfort is the French terminology they
have given you can call it retro for
sure and so whatever you want to call it
but but you are saying in an
intergovernmental deal there's no need
or that there has been no precedent of
having sovereign get sovereign guarantee
is a word that was invented when the
discussions on rafael procurement
started in the media yeah it is not
something that if somebody can quote a
precedence of a sovereign guarantee of
an Indian procurement then there is
something to follow okay Sudan shemitah
since this was an intergovernmental
agreement a Marshal's potential I think
there's no question of a gigantic coming
yeah I'll come to you it's a gum unlike
unlike what the Congress had attempted
to have the lands in the deal this was a
government-to-government deal and so
there was no bank guarantee and a
sovereign guarantee this is an assurance
and as I said today when you see the
entire note the government's conduct is
above board but deliberately the note
has been twisted and taken out of this
parts of it have been taken out of
context mr. Jha you heard making all
kind of allegations which do not that
form a part of this note like his master
Rahul Gandhi who also to them in the
most abusive language started with
chalky touch or you know he is not only
the office of the prime minister of this
country okay I think it's clear I think
it's clear from what emotion Sarah said
that in intergovernmental agreements
there's no question of a sovereign
guarantee so there is no sovereign
guarantee where is the question of
diluting or arise from I don't agree
with them I have an answer I have an
answer Osaka Osaka give me 30 seconds
yeah let me tell you the manufacturer
and the port and a entity responsible
for the delivery
Rafael is the sword the salt is like any
private company now let me tell you you
are talking about India's national
security protection against Iran and
China and are you trying to tell me that
[Music]
his contention is an emotional clear the
air then at the end of the day the
manufacturer of the Rafael is not the
French government it is it is the salt
so if tomorrow something were to happen
to that salt what happens to India's
interest in the money that Indians has
paid up so far in what form is it is it
guaranteed the the salt is delivering
the Rafael aircraft yes under the idea
signed between the defense ministers of
the two countries yes there is no
separate document with the so no no but
that's so is the manufacturer through
the French government yes tomorrow
that's the one to go under if that's all
were to go bankrupt how is India's
interest in the money that India paid up
how is that guaranteed how is that
safeguarded the government of France has
given an assurance to resolve all
troubles that will be faced in this
procurement later
so whatever damages they might have been
the French government is taking
responsibility for it through this
letter of comfort it is that they will
provide all possible support to resolve
these problems that will be encountered
in learning so the letter of support is
as good as a sovereign guarantee it is
how you call it it is more for the legal
people to say what is the sovereign
guarantee and what is an assurance and
but if you go by the past presidents of
government to highest recommend Russia
in cross-border transact okay I'm gonna
I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna wrap up I
would like to ask I mean when United
States we must be a hardy United States
bought c-17 and c-130 and when Mirage
operation will happen builder so where
was the sovereign guarantee if there was
a sovereign going to produce it okay
I'm sure this this this is any issue
that will be spoken in the run-up to the
elections as well it's clearly not going
away from the headlines it's clearly not
going away from the news cycle and I
suspect I suspect there might be more
stories that the Hindu or other media
outlets will put out there as well in
the run-up to the looks of my elections
and they will be contested by the
government and by spokespersons like mr.
Mittal but I want to thank I want to
thank I want thank but in sees I want to
thank you I wanna thank you I wanna
thank you mr. Jha

beginning with the story which is just
broken a short while back what we're now
learning courtesy our investigations
editor Manoj Gupta is that Alok Varma
the disgraced and shunted out CBI chief
is said to be chargesheeted the
Department of Personnel and Training is
issuing this charge sheet against with
suburb on three counts first key
conspirator Rakesh Saxena whose name had
come up in the a fire in the IRCTC scam
the charge being made against a local
mines that he intentionally removed his
name from the FI are countable to
transfer of bank fraud case related to
Rajiv Singh that then joined director
again Alok Varma is being charged of
having interfere in that case and count
number three he allegedly inducted
tainted officers in the CBI where the
special unit of the CBI had given
unfavorable report against them so mr.
Varma now may well see the heat caning
against him his woes aren't going to end
clearly anytime soon this case I believe
folks that have been saying this for a
while it needs closure it was the most
embarrassing episode to have unfolded in
our country's investigation mechanisms
history big story number two multiple
day Chief Minister come a lot what's he
doing he's going all out now to woo
Hindus in his state his administration
has slapped NSA on a bunch of calculus
in Khandwa
three people have been arrested in this
case Mother Pradesh is the second state
after Luther Pradesh where National
Security Act has been slapped on people
who are involved in cow smuggling or
illegal cow killing when yogi Anita not
used the NSA the world was against him
and everyone said what a communal step
to take to have been taken but when
kabbalah does it there is no feudal I
think what it does is it just shows us
that there is a great deal of
shallowness in this entire debate
between booze commoners and whose
secular and I think this event in
manipulation
tells you exactly that big story number
three after any earth since he launched
his party actor turned politician Kamal
Hassan is now saying that he is ready to
confess alone he's often spoken out
against Prime Minister Modi
he's maintained that he wanted to create
a new political alternative in country's
politics from Rahul Gandhi to Arvind
Kejriwal most all politicians have
attempted to move
Kamel towards the site in the past
Kamalhassan may well realize that by the
time the actual campaign begins and the
real voting time comes political
realities may have changed very very
dramatically so for all the great
dialogues which will be making now you
never know whether those dialogues are
also need two votes or time and lastly
the GU that never was the barrage
antibody has lashed out of the Congress
today over a news report alleging you
feared two top leaders wanted to attempt
a coup against the civilian
establishment the BJP is accused the
Congress of maligning the image of the
army purely for political gains and
using the media to plant the story that
the army which was then headed by the
army chief the then army chief General
VK Singh who now happens to be a

was attempting a coup against one mon

the worst form of politics that we have

Directorate in connection with his
properties in the UK his questioning has
been going on for more than five hours
now but it was not him it was his wife
Priyanka Gandhi who made a big political
statement by first dropping him off at
the Enforcement Directorate office and
then going straight to the Congress
headquarters to take charge as the
general secretary in charge of eastern
Uttar Pradesh
Bhadra has been drilling for more than
five hours by Eby officials who are
asking him more than 40 questions
Priyanka Gandhi had a brief word with
CNN news agency an editor Pallavi Ghosh
saying that it is obvious what they are
doing and you could see the crowds there
at the ICC headquarters chanting slogans
of Priyanka Gandhi zindabad
Pallavi joining us from outside the aicc
as well as an official joining us from
outside the IDI office follow me you are
a very brief word with Priyanka Gandhi
what was she trying to say what message
was she trying to convey by landing up
with her husband at the IDI office a
very simple message she goes to drop him
comes back to tension foot walk sit down
unannounced to the aicc headquarters
goes across to her rooms and meets
people from ulta pradesh promises to
come back tomorrow and speak to us a
very simple message but she told me that
obviously their political witch-hunting
but I stand by my husband what she's
trying to do is they're the BJP to show
to them that no matter how much you
target the Congress party or the Gandhi
family I'm still going to carry on and
can your middle work as usual but that's
a simple political message which I think
the sprinkle Gandhi mother tried to send
out today along with the Congress party
because Rahul Gandhi has often been
making the point that anyone who attacks
a questions the Prime Minister and the
BJP is attacked in the other way round
also Xhaka there's often been this
viewpoint that perhaps we uncover shying
away from entering politics because she
was worried that she'll bring the
baggage or water to the Congress party I
think she tried to send that message
across today that this is absolutely not
true
despite the vajra factor we have nothing
to be ashamed of nothing to hide and
it's gonna be business as usual for us
and she's certainly not trying to
disassociate or distance herself from
either the Vadra surname or her husband
she landed up with him a DD office the
nameplate outside her room at a ICC says
Priyanka Gandhi Vadra
so what
intrinsic to her and her personality let
me also get a word in from Leticia it's
been more than five hours Leticia
questioning has been going on we were
given to understand a set of 40
questions written replies for which have
to be submitted by Robert Vadra what's
going on there inside right now well
exactly it's been five hours Dhaka and
till the questioning is going on
although there was some movement outside
the eg office where the questioning is
happening and Jamnagar house but so far
so far there is no no confirmation
whether the questioning has has got has
been over or not because we are as a she
was saying that there were some 40
questions that we do officials have
given to a Robert Vadra and he has to
give in writing or the answers to all
the questions and interestingly as as
again Ashish who covers edy he was
pointing out that one of the main point
of questioning is going to be his link
with Sanjay Bhandari and how does he
know him also apart from that the trail
of money and also the the property that
the immovable assets that he is he has
in in in London so these are some of the
points or points and also important
questions that the idea is going to
enter Gate on and also because he has
come here and the court has ordered
Robert water to cooperate EDD will be
taking up the maximum of the opportunity
that they could from this this
questioning it's been fibers we're
expecting some more time he is going to
be inside there is a movement outside
but now everything is realized there
were the Delhi police officials who were
holding the ropes and we were expecting
that Robert Vadra might come out but
there is no moment outside the eg office
right now and every even the Delhi
police officials are relaxed now that
white toyota prado has been there for
the last couple of hours at least
that's the vehicle which will ferry
Robert Vadra back to his home after an
intense day of grilling I'm gonna wrap
it up thanks to Pallavi as well as
Natisha the story is not over folks it's
just beginning tomorrow there's an
important meeting that Rahul Gandhi is
called for for all Congress general
secretaries and state and charges
Priyanka is expected to come to the ICC
headquarters and as she has promised
Pallavi Kosh she's expected to take some
questions and give some answers about
the political nature of these
allegations and the political response
that she has to
what she believes is a witch hunt and
the targeting of a husband

one the CAG investigation in rough pile

session itself what we're now learning
is that the C AG's investigation in the
file episode will be tabled to this
session CNN news 18 had reported earlier
how C AG's investigations not going to
get into pricing mechanism it will
simply imply that they won't do
anomalies in the deal but I'd say if the
entire concept of CAG investigation
which was to compare what has been
bought with some other product if that
argument is not being weighed then
what's the AG report are we talking
about if there is no comparison then
surely the opposition will use that
opportunity to say that this report is
also a fixed report much like several
other things which the opposition finds
Story number two poll strategist scum JD
vice president Prashant Kishor he
certainly is moving across the political
spectrum with great ease he's now
supporting Shiv Sena's campaign plan
from the package in the party in 2014 to
the JD r JD combo in 2015 to the
Congress SB combo in 17 2009 2019 well
certainly Prashant Kishor as a matter of
the moment Mushaf Kishore could well end
up having a role play folks on the road
to 2019 while he's with Nitesh kumar his
relationship with politicians across the
spectrum could ensure that he ends up
playing the mr. Brij role on the road to
2019 if alliance politics ends up
becoming a reality big story number
three Ana's RA the celebrated activist

farmers the godfather of anti-corruption

nazar a today does not unfortunately

another move what he's done is that he's
made it mandatory for all state funded
universities to hire at least 70% of the
staff from within the state Camelot has
a tough job at hand as BJ pees popular
wood in the state despite the law still

trying to create a state-specific cause
a move which by the way had been used by
Prime Minister Modi when he was a chief
producer of good job and finally victory

gaining steam word is the DPS is about
to seal a deal with the barrage in the

Shareen part of CNBC tv18 has spoken to
millionaire investor and Auto Ruchi
Sharma who says that development alone
cannot win votes and it's always the
vote is against the incumbent listening
to this special conversation will catch
you again tomorrow night same time 8
p.m.
thank you time correct look at the 2014
election what happened then was as we
well know that the BJP got 31 percent of
the vote share but the number of seats
it got was 9 times more in terms of like
over 280 that ratio was unparalleled in
Indian political history but he never
had an instance where a party with 31
percent of the votes shake managed to
get more than half the seats in the Lok
Sabha and that happened because the
opposition was very badly divided in the
key battleground states I think that in
this election what what's gonna really
matter is that I don't think the BJP is
vote share as such is gonna go down too
much maybe gp's vote share will go down
a bit in the Hindi Heartland area it may
make up a bit in the eastern inner parts
of the country and another parts maybe
but I or it may go down even a bit but I
think that the big thing in this
election is going to be about the
alliances which are being formed in key
battleground states from yupi yeah yeah
yeah right up to Maharashtra and I think
that that's not really gonna define this
election more than I'd say you know like
this entire debate in Delhi we love
having these debates about you know how
is Modi doing and sort of you know like
how's the budget and how much of sort of
anger there is against the government in
things yeah all those I think are
factors but the really big factor is
going to be how many alliances are
stitched because that's the short
history of Indian democracy that
whenever alliances are stitched against
a very powerful leader of the center
from Indira Gandhi to Rajiv Gandhi to
watch by typically the Alliance's tend
to prevail where the alliances don't
come together then I think that Modi has
a pretty good chance of coming back you
know speaking of alliances in for the
very first time here in yupi which is as
you know the cliche the road to Delhi is
why you pee samajwadi party in the BSP
getting together and you know Maya these
political can boo me is which nor in a
sense as well how significant is that
going to be in the fact that the
Congress is outside of that you think
that that is actually going to work to
the advantage of this alliance I think
like I started the state is concerned
just a plain Matt suggested the Alliance
is gonna be very strong so in fact when
I came to write the closing chapter of
my book on bridge nor late last year I
went back and told our traveling travel
companions that I don't think there's
any point where do you pee this time at
that point in time it wasn't clear if
the alliance would come through or not
but the basic analysis was that if the
Alliance comes through then this state
basically goes towards the Alliance the
Alliance doesn't come through it goes to
the BJP so I think that as far as this
state is concerned and all the opinion
polls it's hard to trust them at this
stage but yeah for whatever it's worth
seem to confirm that so I don't think I
don't think this election yupi is going
to be that important a state because I
think that the vote bases are very
entrenched and the mind has been made up
and so I think that this tea the
Alliance has a clear advantage I think
what's going to determine this election
much more are going to be the other
states including the fact that how much
is the BJP sort of lose because of the
way it's swept and 2014 exactly I'm just
like all the states from right up from
Gujarat to Bihar how much of the you
know what it does there and then some
key states like I don't know what's
really going to happen in Andhra Pradesh
in terms of you know like who prevails
there I think Maharashtra the Alliance
is gonna matter or more so my dream
election trip for the 2008 election trip
for what is being billed as arguably the
biggest election yes in in it's not
going to be I think should be that we
should basically travel coast-to-coast
to go start from Mumbai and go to Chaka
Putnam because I think that built from
Maharashtra northern Karnataka Telangana
and Andhra Pradesh could be very
critical and of course it's why the
Indian elections are concerned the great
thing about it like Indian election that
about India in general and for the big
themes in my book that this is more a
continent than a country so it's many in
here yes yeah and it's very difficult to
sort of pinpoint on one or two states
where you really want to go but if you
have to really sort of
zone into as to where to go that's it I
would ideally like to

v9UfdcDmuBk,Election Epicentre | What is Congress Planning To Do With General Secretary In-Charge Of East UP?,Priyanka Gandhi is in the political game now and officially is today at the AICC meeting. The big question today: What is Congress ...,2019-02-05T15:31:31Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v9UfdcDmuBk/hqdefault.jpg,"let's begin our discussion on the main
story of the day it is about decoding
what exactly is the Congress planning to
do with this general secretary in charge
of Easterns of the Pradesh I'm talking
about Priyanka Gandhi here who's back in
India and we have got the first images
of Nita Priyanka Gandhi is steps in
purplish midnight a rickety so tidy or
third Podesta Raj native make positive
changes
as the general elections near all eyes
are on a third Pradesh the coveted state
that decides who claims to claims power
at the center because it said that road
to power in New Delhi is through Lucknow
that is the capital city of Otter
Pradesh it is about 80 MPs ladies and
gentlemen and hence it's very important
in all scheme of things for the BJP
particularly because it had swept the
state in 2014
winning 71 along with up another two
more 73 out of 80 seats but the Congress
is preparing a solo strategy with
Priyanka Gandhi at the tip of the spear
after making her eastern Uttar Pradesh
in charge the Congress is now putting
together an election plan to launch
Priyanka Gandhi and give a tough fight
to the BJP and also the Samajwadi Party
BSP Alliance we decided to forge an
alliance - the Congress party a new
meeting is set to begin shortly in a ICC
is what we are being told in fact
sources have told CNN news 18 that the
newly formed with the pradesh team will
meet at Rahul Gandhi's residence even as
we speak in fact that meeting is going
on what they will be doing is to talk
out a strategy to launch Priyanka Gandhi
there will be of course a grand launch
as the Congress certainly would want
decide her public meetings what will be
her area of focus
how many rallies and how many weeks will
she be spending as general secretary in
charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh what we
are also being told that she would be
taking charge as Congress general
secretary in Lucknow on February 7 and
there after her entire campaign strategy
will be worked out now this will be the
second meeting between the Uttar Pradesh
team and Rahul Gandhi the first meeting
remember was on Monday and here it was
discussed that yupi Congress chief a rag
Bubber what we are being told in fact
rev Rahul Gandhi on the implications of
the Samajwadi Party BSP Alliance and how
it is very important for the Congress to
focus on those pockets where they did
well in 2009
remember the Congress had 123 seats
then and hence how can they actually
maximize their influence is what the
Congress is certainly hoping to do but
the big takeaway is also what we are
being told is that the Congress is
looking at looks about polls as one step
Priyanka gondry is being pitched by the
Congress for a long term strategy here
is the view from the uttar pradesh
congress what we are being told is that
Priyanka Gandhi is an essential part of
party's mission 2020 - that is the year
many assembly elections will be held she
will be holding multiple meetings
function you know ensuring that there is
a particular focus on strengthening the
grassroots strengthening the party from
the base itself
Pallavi goo is joining us live from the
Congress headquarters branch of Mishra
is joining us live from Lucknow is about
YC is live from outside Rahul Gandhi's
residence y la viga
Pallavi first day first show how does it
look like
[Music]
well I mean it's official now she's got
an office just next to Rahul Gandhi's
office and very interesting nuances over
there really Mario and the office where
she sits in now I wish she's gonna start
sitting now is one which belongs to
Rahul Gandhi earlier and when he became
the Congress person he shifted into
Sonia Gandhi's office and this was a
makeshift office for his staff well
Priyanka come in and I you know it's a
very special office and the fact that
she is going to sit next to Rahul Gandhi
as a general secretary also makes it
very clear she's going to be no ordinary
general secretary in the Congress party
she's always going to hold that special
position and by virtue of the fact
literally also and even the way it's
going to work out with the Congress
party she's going to be the second arm
really of Rahul Gandhi strategy as far
as the Congress party is concerned what
we are being told of course is the
nitty-gritty is being chalked out in the
meeting yesterday there was a briefing
session for Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and
also for the authorizers in there about
what the semantics are what the
situation really is in eastern and
western Uttar Pradesh what should be the
areas of focus but on seventh is the
meeting of the general secretaries and
by virtue of being a general secretary
she's expected to be a part of their
meeting they're going to look at the
larger picture that's what Rahul Gandhi
also conveyed yesterday let's
just focus on the state because of the
state elections also look at the looks
of my elections and also look at the
fact beyond that the Congress party
should aim to come back to power in
orthopod Asian that's going to be the
critical role of regard Avada so on
seven that meeting is essentially going
to focus on that and then she's gonna be
of course going across to Lucknow
traveled to her area and of course she
will be meeting up with booth workers
because Mari at the end of the day how
well a party does depends on how much
Okada is galvanized and a Congress party
certainly needs that kind of
galvanization and that's what the BJP
says is its biggest strength right now
that amateurs converted this BJP into an
election winning machines Abbasi got us
the first images of Natha Priyanka
Gandhi is a bar you're standing outside
Rahul Gandhi's residents what is
happening there is Priyanka Gandhi there
and how long is the meeting likely to
continue when did it begin give us the
details and also about this team that we
are hearing which will be part of for
Priyanka Gandhi East Priyanka Gandhi and
there will be some social media strategy
what are you picking up
Marya that important meeting which is
going which was scheduled to take place
at 6:30 p.m. is running late what we can
tell you is that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra
is act president attention but it's
Sonia Gandhi's residence inside this
particular house of Rahul Gandhi there
is a meeting with with a thermal nadu
leaders with Rahul Gandhi is presiding
over so it is slightly delayed but in a
short while from now we're expecting
Priyanka Gandhi Godhra to reach her and
then that crucial Uttar Pradesh meeting
to begin which will be attended by
Priyanka Gandhi vatra by Kelvin who call
who the general secretary in charge of
organization by Jody Radha de Cynthia
general secretary in charge of West yupi
rajma but the PCC chief and of course
Rahul Gandhi Congress person will be
presiding over that meeting and the
forward strategy of what is the road
forward for Priyanka Gandhi Vadra she
takes charge and when will she take
official charge is it happening at the
national headquarters here in Delhi or
will she be going to Lucknow for it all
of these things will be clarified after
this particular meeting which will play
take place here at all Gandhi's
residence now as far as Priyanka Gandhi
vedras low profile entry is concerned
Mario ever since she came back
yesterday she has maintained a low
profile a she she's always taken the
back exit
whether she's leaving Rahul Gandhi's
residence last night on her own place
today she is making a conscious attempt
to evade the press maybe she's keeping a
low profile that because she wants to
keep it low
there are expectations which are very
high on on her shoulders at the moment
because Congress party in Uttar Pradesh
is something that she has to pretty much
build up from scratch social media
profile for Priyanka Gandhi is also
something that we're picking up a
Twitter handle an official Twitter
handle will be launched soon along with
her official launch so all of these
things will be will be more will be a
taking place in the days to come and
it's a batch schedule for her all
through the day today we saw with her
pradesh pcc leaders who kept coming in
at Priyanka Gandhi Juarez residents
wanting to seek an appointment so that
has already begun she herself has sought
numbers of around 15 leaders and workers
from yupi in yesterday's meeting we will
know more details of what exactly will
happen the next few days after today's
and we'll keep you posted on that
crucial meeting mom all right let me
bring in brown shoe wear action shifts
very shortly a perhaps in the next few
days branch you special preparation also
add the Congress office in Lucknow I am
told that perhaps a new office in fact
an old office is being refurbished that
one which was occupied by her
grandmother in the rug on D no Maria is
not like that in fact are the a ICC
general secretaries they have office at
the ICC headquarters and here there is
no room which is specially earmarked for
the a ICC general secretary but what I
mean Pallavi was saying that if if
Priyanka Gandhi is moving into the earth
style office occupied by Rahul Gandhi at
the a ICC headquarters if it is about
the political symbolism within the party
on the ground a no trepidation it will
actually turn into the political reality
because the task which mr. Rahul Gandhi
was bestowed till yesterday of building
in the organization in the state now
that challenge will shift to Priyanka
Gandhi and the entire party leadership
is very show about it how Priyanka
Gandhi is going to do that that needs to
be seen but yes as both of my fellow
colleagues have clearly said that the
biggest task of course is to build the
organization
because the robust strong organization
can only be the fun to be the foundation
on which you can actually galvanize the
people at large and could ensure the
electoral victories there for Priyanka
Gandhi's role is not just limited to a
couple of months say to the 2019 polls
but to a larger mission of mission 2022
and therefore when Rahul Gandhi on 23rd
of January was an orthopedist she
clearly said that he has brought both
Cynthia and and Priyanka with a
long-term intent and that intent is that
we should have a chief minister in 2022
so clearly road ahead is quite
challenging for Priyanka Gandhi she is
clearly going to now share the same
responsibilities of which many of us
were expecting Rousey to do to build the
organization in utter Pradesh now that
responsibility will shift to Priyanka
Gandhi alright thank you so much for
joining us Pallavi zibeon Franchi thank
you so much let me bring in my guests
now Rashid Kidwai and Aishwarya Mahadev
Aishwarya a lot of anticipation clearly
is the Congress also getting nervous
given the kind of expectations that has
been built up around Priyanka Gandhi I
don't think there's any cause to be
nervous because mrs. mrs. Priyanka
Gandhi has constantly worked for the
family and the party over decades she
has never taken a role in front however
now finally she's decided to come out of
the shadows and play an active part in
nation-building and also building the
Indian National Congress I think as far
as we've seen the way that she has
performed in the various capacities in
her close interaction with frontals she
is done fabulously well much despite the
fact that a lot of public and the media
does not know about it I think more than
anything it's the anticipation to see a
young bold female voice and face come up
in politics and see how she can impact
and have a positive impact on more women
that want to join and also more
youngsters yes Rasheed you know this
entire euphoria and the fact that
Priyanka Gandhi chose to have a very low
profile return to India there was a lot
of preparations that was going on in
fact in the news rooms how many
reporters should be sent at their posts
to actually capture the first glimpse of
Priyanka Gandhi and here is Priyanka
Gandhi was back in India with very few
people actually knowing about it yeah
this is a case of Cobras missing a great
opportunity the grand opening of brand
Priyanka Gandhi should have been in
Lucknow should have been in Allahabad
where Coomer is going on or at Warren se
or Rob Riley MIT I think Delhi is not a
place I mean the Communist obsession
with Delhi is something that Elsa you
know it's very strange it's baffling you
see there are no silver medals in
politics in cricket terms the slog over
sir on general elections around the
corner
she has to work in ground you know
through Pradesh and as you rightly said
the way to Delhi is from couple days I
don't know what is she waiting for a
watery what is he going to gain by
occupying a room in a fog but Road she
has to Marya I think anybody that knows
the disposition of mrs. Priyanka Gandhi
knows the fact that she's very
understated and she's very silent and
she's a worker that does more than she
speaks and she's not the one for the
poem fanfare and the opulence that you
would expect it's sort of grand welcome
no matter what sort of political mileage
it would give you the personality of
mrs. Gandhi Priyanka Gandhi is such that
she would rather have a subtle welcome
and more than anything there are several
general secretaries of across the
country all of whom have had welcomes in
their home state as and when they've
been assigned which is going to happen
in Uttar Pradesh as well but I do not
believe she especially and the Congress
party feels that this is going to be
played way more than it should there is
already a lot of intrigue and also
excitement about mrs. Priyanka Gandhi
entry you know Rashid and I think that's
good enough for us and we do agree that
there may be curiosity around the
Priyanka Gandhi Vadra factor but that
may not translate into electoral
victories immediately for the Congress
Marya app you know then as I said there
is no silver medal in politics Priyanka
Gandhi has not come as general secretary
of a communist party to get her to
increase Congress tell you from 44 to it
68 or 70 or 80 the communist has to be
you know 125 and above in order to hold
a pole position a visible the formation
of next government or keeping you know
the there in the model
now in that scenario with the British is
very important well BGP has 72 73 it's
not a question of personality trait or
you know what you like doing words you
don't like doing if you are in politics
you ha you have to deliver if you don't
deliver then of course that brand
pre-owned Gandhi is not here to play a
helping hand for month of energy or
myopathy or someone else to you know
become Prime Minister she's there to
bring you know the prime position of
Congress back to the you know national
political scene and if she if she
doesn't do it then obviously I mean to
say 2022 and all is fine but it is
nineteen that will that will return yes
yes you know if we look at how she has
performed in 2007 when she was managing
a meeting and ribéry Lee or in 2012 when
she was seen as someone strategizing and
playing this arc role of architecture of
an architect of the Congress SP Alliance
she has failed yes and and the communist
is actually as organization is the out
of sync because there's so much I
recently traveled to u P there's so much
expectation what she will do will she
contest against that is move the evil
chicken test for me I barely I mean the
Congress has to respond to its you know
workers Cardinal sympathizers you know
expectations it just cannot be saying
you know who's occupying next one you
know Rahul Gandhi in 24th parole what
will be our social media profile is a
limit okay okay Rashid convey and
Aishwarya Madre thank you so much for
joining us

So, we take your viewpoint on the question: Can ...",2019-02-04T17:37:57Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sGQCU2Acddc/hqdefault.jpg,"good evening Namaskar Adam it said that
all is fair in love and war and frankly
what we're now witnessing in West Wing
wall is nothing short of war
it's DV versus the rest there's no other
way to describe events which are
unfolding very very dramatically in West
Bengal on a day when supreme court chief
justice justice Runyan Gogoi threatened
or should I say caution both the Kolkata
Police Commissioner Ajit Kumar
for allegedly destroying evidence in the
circus camp as well as wondering what
was the big evidence the Central Bureau
of Investigation had managed to get or
wanted to get hold off after almost six
years since investigations began month
Adi is threatening an agitation which
will conclude to quote her only when
they're in the mood ease-out stood the
CBI has filed a contempt petition
against Rajeev Kumar the Kolkata Police
Commissioner and the case is set to be
heard tomorrow is Rajeev Kumar now
frankly speaking the pawn on whose
shoulders this entire battle is
unfolding big news maker joining us at
9:35 tonight finance minister huge
school who's just presented a please all
budget but who began his budgetary
speech with a clear-cut reference to
cracking down on corruption is cracking
down on corrupt opposition politicians
an integral part of the birther Giunta
party strategy on the road to 2019 that
big interview coming up huge Coyle uncut
candid and speaking in a manner that
he's never spoken before specifically
when it comes to dealing with corruption
what are we talking about folks and why
is this battle for West Bengal suddenly
being looked at as a battle which will
determine what is going to happen in
2019 this is nothing else but this is
political perception power playing which
is playing itself at its peak because
you're talking about a state where the
BJP before 2014 did not exist now the
BJP believes it will spend all it has an
opportunity it has an opportunity to
take home the charisma the firepower
which is often
widenar in the movie the 3p Syndrome
perception power and play political
partly what is the render what he's
saying Narendra Modi says da Cunha
nikana Duma what is the narrative which
has been built around the top 2 of the
Congress party as Prime Minister Modi
himself said Sonia Gandhi dragged on the
old members of the Gandhi family are
Belgard e-bay legardie because both the
top two of the Congress party out on
bail in the National Herald case let's
look at the other key challenger who
wants to challenge who wants to give a
fight to Narendra Modi former yupi chief
minister
the man who teamed up with the Congress
party he described himself as u P killer
kid the moment this market London was
worked out between each other when Maya
thei immediately there was a case that
was filed against him he now happens to
be the key beneficiary of an illegal
mining scam is he really the key
beneficiary or again this is power play
that we're looking at his Bua who used
to be his rival Maya 3 another former UK
Chief Minister BSP supremo she continues
to face before every election by arathi
always faces income tax investigations
now she's facing investigation of the U
P sugar mill scam the one man whose name
has always been used by the BJP to
suggest that something was fundamentally
wrong with the Congress party former
finance minister mr. P Chidambaram now
mr. Chidambaram folks whose often been
whose uh whose whose names have often
been used along with along with the the
present Andhra Chief Minister mr.
Chandra Babu Naidu 2015 cash
episode which unfolds around him then
there is Mamta banerjee there's a saga
scam rose when we scan the nagas scam
all kinds of scandals she's always been
hit by the point that we're trying to
make is this that it appears whether
it's mr. Chidambaram or its Chandrababu
Naidu or it's month of energy or Marathi
or a kill each other everyone appears to
be facing cases of corruption or should
we say alleged corruption if there were
such serious cases and if there was such
serious evidence against Assad
as has been suggested the new I know
action has been taken against him
mr. Chidambaram is well within his
rights to say that this is nothing else
but a witch-hunt a character
assassination campaign which had been
launched against him in the context of
this battle which is taking place where
there is one man who talks about
integrity a corruption free India
Narendra Modi versus his entire group
all of whom face investigations by some
investigating agency or the other is
this the battle that we're gonna unsee
unfold on the road to 2019 one man's
crackdown on corruption versus the
entire lot of opposition all parties
standing together being dubbed as
corrupt that's why we call it the
perceived political power play where do
we stand let's take a straightforward
position on this the truth is this folks
the West Bengal case the west wing wall
case is about whether the BJP can
actually manage to position itself as
the principal opposition force in the
state of West Bengal if mum type energy
can be projected as a leader who has
something to hide the BJP is bound to
feel then it will manage to push this
agenda that a vote for opposition is a
vote to protect the corrupt this case
may well be the biggest story next to
the mahogany ndon which had been created
in Uttar Pradesh to take on Prime
Minister Modi led party Giunta party
that's where we said let's raise a big
blunt question on the show tonight and
find out whether our panelists agree or
disagree with our viewpoint can this
month our versus CBI battle which is
taking place in Bengal can it actually
lead to advantage BJP in Bangkok look at
the kind of statements being made by top
bosses of the BJP by top leaders of the
BJP how will this play out let's welcome
our panelists a me Bane Yagnik
spokesperson of the Congress party
joining us time Swapan Dasgupta resident
commentator I met Bal we are
spokesperson the BJP doctors a banker
they went on political analysts and
Trinamool sympathizer a warm welcome
warm welcome to all of you dr. day let
me first begin with you and let me get
this straight from you Mamta banerjee as
we speak is welcoming they'd just be
other she's about to welcome Connie Mui
the DMK leader as well and the sense
being created is that it's the entire
rank and file a the BJP versus mamta
Banerjee
let me get this clear Amanda Banerjee is
so very confident of opposition then why
does month are not allowed the chopper
of yogi Adityanath also happens to be a
constitutional elected chief minister to
landed mingle
why does month I Banerjee have problems
when Amit Shah chopper wants to land at
a certain position there is a problem if
the BJP wants to take out a yatra she
has a problem is Mamta banerjee jittery
in terms of the campaign which has been
unleashed by the BJP dr. day actually
not actually not if you if you if you
listen to the different statements made
by the different portfolio holders of
the Bharatiya Janata Party and also the
president of the Ajanta party you will
find that there are many occasions where
we have found that this the statements
made by him and his many of his
colleagues right doesn't gel well with
the culture of Bengal and referring say
Bengali is a star might and making lots
of you know racist comments it really
doesn't gel when with the Bengal culture
so definitely as the administrator and
the people who are involved in the
administration and lawyer order you know
maintaining law and order they have got
the rights to see and ensure that
nothing goes wrong but why if but what
happens if yo get this this is where
this is where I think the story gets
very intriguing this a yogi yogi a
little not camp energy there is a
problem so I want to know what is the
source of problem with you know I don't
think that is I don't think that was a
political issue on which this was not
done I think that was absolutely a
safety related issue safety government
presence elected chief minister presence
of a constitutional elected chief
minister in a state just just a minute
safety of the the craft that that is the
aircraft that has to learn in a place
that is the most important thing you
cannot allow
a aircraft to land in any place I'm in
decided this is safe whose safety whose
safety were we talking about with
Bolivia because I think this is it's
important to flag off the entire
sequence of events there is dr. day said
the problem was with the safety of the
chopper which was to land the safety of
the aircraft was it safety of the
aircraft or was it political safety of
mamta banerjee that was it pay the remit
Malviya you know the pain I don't think
what we're seeing in this Bengal has
been seen in any other state probably
because the incumbent governments in
those states are fairly confident about
the work they are doing and the whole
that they have on the electorate there
now in case of mamta Banerjee it
obviously seems that she has read the
writing on the wall and she knows that a
support in the state is slipping and
that's why she first did not allow the
BJP to conduct a yatra which is the
legitimate right of any political party
she went to the court on flimsy grounds
and she cannot manage the law and order
situation if that is the case then she
should resign as the chief minister but
they both of Bengal date back the number
of rights that have happened in Bengal
whereas maldehyde Scalia Chuck you just
name it there have been riots at the
smallest even you look at the panchayat
polls that happen that was marred with a
lot of political violence still the BJP
clocked over 30 percent would share in
the panchayat election now given that
looks of my elections around the corner
Mamta Banerjee realizes that all's not
well and she stands to lose given that
and her welting ambition to play the
anchor for the mahogany bundle obviously
is posing a problem for her now this
particular flash point that she's picked
up is not something that's the doing of
the 2014 or a mr. Modi's government this
was in fact ordered before the NDA took
office and this was a inquiry which
which was initiated in 2013 when the
India was not in power also now to
allege that CBI doing his job under the
instruction of Supreme Court is an
assault on federalism
is there is a political attack is taking
it too far the other important point I
want to make the pain is there all these
so-called opposition leaders who are
today crying foul are they all above
corruption we have known that in 2014
the UPA got voted out because each of
their leaders were mired in massive
corruption Chidambaram is hopping
month-on-month on bail we have had cases
of DMK getting embroiled in the 2g
spectrum case similar with teachers via
dove or for that matter
Akhilesh Yadav all of them have had
history of massive corruption it's not
something that they were all cleaned
before 2014 and suddenly the world has
discovered a virtue called corruption
and all of them happen to be leaders of
the so-called market bundle or the
opposition therefore there is a lot of
political opportunism Mamata Banerjee
things by getting into this flashpoint
she may be able to retain her base I
mean that's unlikely to happen because
three big problems I mean young Yamane
yagnik what does this imply tell me you
know through the day
and we have an interview with pues go l
will come up at 9:35 the point being
made is in narendra modi was in
opposition
when Amit Shah was in opposition
ultimately Amit Shah went to jail but
they never took this position you know
that we will not beat the CBI that we
will not face a CBI if mum type energy
is absolutely clean don't you think it
would have been best optics wise
political politics wise any way you look
at it if the Kolkata Police Commission
instead of sitting on a political stage
with the Chief Minister would have said
would have gone met the CBI cooperate
with the CBI why why this why this
desire to score a political point I
think there should there cannot be
comparison as to when you talk about the
then chief minister and the Home
Minister mr. Amash at that time in
Gujarat because all these were cases
that were filed by the victim skin and
in the Supreme Court and these were all
supreme court monitor cases the present
case
is not a Supreme Court monitored case
because the Supreme Court has said that
we are not going to monitor this case
the investigation can go on
that was a swayback as in 2014 now four
and a half years later suddenly the CBI
wakes up after having collected all the
evidence I am NOT taking any sides I am
NOT speaking of speaking purely legally
all the points today made by the BJP
spokesperson are completely haunting the
BJP itself because the BJP is losing
ground everywhere has indulged into
complete destruction of institutions
whether it is the RBI whether it's the
IDI whether the CBI and CBI has already
lost its credibility by knocking the
doors of the epic volume for a moment I
mean I just for a woman-hating because
we're talking about corruption and how
are you how are you it's coincidental
that while you are talking about
corruption and you're saying the BJP has
much to answer for look at the flashes
that we've got UK Home Secretary has now
approved Vijay Mallya is extradition
that's a big breaking story tonight here
we are talking about whether month.i
Banerjee wants to avoid facing Central
Bureau of Investigation and I myself
argue whether the credibility of CBI is
at the crossroads but look at this it
doesn't I mean we got Christian Michele
we got deeper tal bar we got Sanjeev
Shah now look at what we've got sanjeev
khanna we may just be getting Vijay
Mallya himself Sanjay sir is on the
phone line a redditor european affairs
sanjay is now game set that matches it
all done dusted for Vijay Mallya does he
still have any legal appeal legal
strategy left and not quite uninterested
yet this is an order from the UK Home
Secretary in relation to the order or
extradition pass with a quote of the
magistrate now the magistrate has to
refer the matter to the secretary of
state who considers some other grounds
other than those that the court
considered whether the exhibition can be
blocked he considered all and rejected
those the position now is that the
Secretary of State has ordered the
extradition
it is against this order of the
Secretary of State that Vijay Mallya or
will now go to the High Court
appeal even notice that he will appeal
in the High Court to the appeals court
and this order of the Secretary of State
click start that process o appeal but
what you're saying Sonia is interesting
you're saying the Home Secretary's
supposed to look at certain facts which
may be different from the facts that you
have been looked at by the court
therefore I would assume that whatever
strategy mr. Mallya may have may have
adopted even where in this but even when
petitioning the office of the Home
Secretary that strategy obviously would
have failed
well we there are slightly different
issues for under the law for the
secretary of state to consider and these
are really more of a technicality it is
very rare that the Secretary of State
ever considers that at all dance
live from expectation on those girls and
he gives you a lower bound to consider
those which he has considered and
rejected which is to say that he has
upheld the order of the magistrate the
Westminster magistrate for the
extradition and it is a disorder that
Mallya will now appeal in the High Court
okay Sanjay thanks for that update let
me go process often las looped on this
one because it's it's really becoming
big Swapan look at the optics on one
hand you have West Bengal Chief Minister
who's getting support of the entire
rank-and-file of the opposition saying
that there is a threat to federal
structure the CPI is not being honest on
the other hand you have a genuine
possibility now Vijay Mallya may be
being extradited back before the
elections take place what does this me
to this big corruption crackdown which
has been unleashed by Moody still
partisan or in the interest of the
nation well I want to refer you to month
of energy's January 19 speech and that
huge rally which she held in Kolkata and
a lot of you know I I know she spoke in
three languages but there was a
particular part in Bengali which a lot
of people may have missed its
significance and she said that there is
always a Lakshmanan Rekha in politics
which is that you don't attack leaders
Narendra Modi has violated that Lakshman
Rekha he has attacked lalu Yadav
he has attacked achalasia though he is
attacked Chidambaram I mean I forget the
names at Leicester but he may mention
she mentioned a few people everyone I
mean and now he is Annie Annie now he
has trained his guns on me so in other
words the central feature there will be
you see there is something called
opposition to Narendra Modi NID I
expected mamta Banerjee to have that
opposition knowledge about the end the
BJP but when that opposition turns to
visceral hatred
what is the reason and I think it has
got to lot to do with this this thing
that month of energy believes the cheese
under personal attack for corruption now
whether this is based on reality whether
this is based on paranoia whether this
is based on paranoia about herself or
someone very close to her is a matter of
conjecture but I think that after
Narendra Modi's two very very successful
rallies last Saturday one in Kaku Nagar
and one in Durga pool against in the
face of a a not very perfect BJP
organisation and be in the face of a
large amount of administrative obstacles
which were set up the spontaneous
turnout
I think rattled her completely and
that's therefore guys what we're seeing
now that that that was really the
trigger and she was looking for an
excuse she was looking for an exit they
follow this whole thing yeah for an
excuse which to egg in the excuse to
bolster this rhetoric about central
state being only non Bengali that the
portrait minimal person they said you
know that there are written art and BJP
and all had talked in a language which
is inimical to the culture of Bengal
believe it's inimical to the culture of
being all the people of Bengal will
reject it because it's a incidental
feature that the Jana Sangh was formed
by Shama Prasad Mookerjee who's a
stalwart of Bengali Kino civilization
culture
it's a matter of incidental details but
I think mum tub energy has set the stage
so that she can turn the entire
attention away as it was getting she
seemed to be losing focus now for the
past 24 hours what she is very
successfully done is that the end all
the spotlight all the attention
everything is focused on her but you
know maybe she's chosen and it's you
but you solve that but but that's the
point I was about to make uh me Ben it's
a double edged sword the entire look and
look at what's happening and maybe
Rowell Gandhi is therefore made the
right move by not going and sharing that
stage with month.i Banerjee because I'm
just wondering at the I'm trying to look
at the optics on women on one hand you
have AG Amalia on one hand you have this
the narrative that will play out that
Modi
Sircar is succeeding when it comes to
cracking down against big corruption and
on the other hand you have this entire
rank-and-file of the opposition class
which is all coming together only and
only because serious questions are being
raised against one Chief Minister now we
can maybe have a debate on protocol or
otherwise but why should why should i
why should a Chief Minister why should a
Kolkata Police Commissioner not be
subjected to questioning if the
investigating agencies are really
convicted they have they have a
foolproof case as what we're seeing
unfold in front of us in which is
Krishna absolutely I think you can't
compare with gemelas case and the
present case because that is between two
countries and the extradition is on
international law and we may not go into
that right now
but the fact here is that there's a
something called a due process of law
and that is the issue why this whole
thing has happened in West Bengal the
investigation has been going on for
quite some time maybe more than five
years and this government has been
sitting over it suddenly the CBI wakes
up it doesn't wait for one more day that
the chief is going to take over a new
chief of the CBI is going to take over
no due process is being followed and
suddenly 40 people end up at the door of
one of the objects a person's but the
optics optical zoom is going on the
Oh symbolism and I try to draw attention
to political symbolism batteries yes yes
so so and so yes I'm the whole focus is
there that yes the CBI is being used and
at a time when the looks of my elections
are right there and so who is jittery
who is worried who is using the CBI that
is come coming out you know that also is
optics and that is why I think West
Bengal's InFocus and even the CBI is
role is in focus
so I am I do I do it is also going to
happen do I put a distress upon that if
you vote for the BJP you get hold of
Vijay Mallya you work for the BJP you
get hold of Christian mission and all
these other crooked characters you don't
want for the BJP and what do you get you
get this entire plethora of all
opposition leaders who all come together
protecting their own personal interests
is that what we're now seeing unfold on
the road to 2019 serpent you think that
is an implied narrative that is an
implied narrative and that is the
narrative which narendra modi spoke out
quite aggressively in his durga Parelli
at least he said you know look at it
while you what are you afraid of me now
that's the question which a lot of
people doubt what one the BJP and one
hand is trying to do is that there is
while there is mamta Banerjee who
occupies a very large part of the
political space there is a vacuum in the
ante mamta space where the CPM which is
not it's only a pinch a dough of what it
was the Congress which are which which
is in a bit of a disarray in Bengal so
that space is gradually being taken over
by the BJP and the BJP there is really
on a roll
despite its own internal considerable
internal shortcomings within the state
it is basically in its its piggybacking
entirely on Narendra Modi and mamta
Banerjee has to fold things one is she
has certain national ambitions and at
the same time she wants to keep hold of
the state therefore and I think today's
the you know they did this entire drama
and I think I would
I'd like to say it's a drama you know
calling it equating it with the second
freedom struggle I mean really I mean
mamta energy in the past has never had
any great respect for the institution of
the police commissioner of Kolkata
I mean Renji button and that was shoved
out quite ignominiously in this month of
energy in the past and also made
ridiculous claims like there is an army
coup in the offing in Bengal right she's
made those sort of claims but this all
today you know look at the challenge
this is why is she yeah is she shot her
boom therefore the question is did she
do it out of impulse or did she do it
out of premeditation therefore the Punk
is any of the three normal people are in
a position to actually say therefore
therefore this I don't know therefore he
actually action yeah the bungled and
therefore therefore you look at again I
look at look at vijay mallya look at how
the narrative will play out that this is
the government which means business if
we if we do manage to get hold of Vijay
Mallya I think after getting hold of
Christian Michel without doubt it'll be
it will be celebrated as a big victory
for Moody Sarkar in that kind of an
environment of today how do you argue
that actually investigating agencies
back home are only fixing political
rivals but investigating agencies
outside India are in a position to bring
back all these people who've treated the
cause of India yeah a very good question
you have asked but I would like to
remind only that the Vijay Mallya was
allowed hello yeah I can hear you I can
hear you top lip yeah yeah yeah Vijay
was allowed by this government to
abscond right but he's not the
government allowed him takes he's always
right back no no it is something like a
got up game now you have allowed someone
to go out of India and then and bring
him back is just before the election and
take the credit that we have brought him
back that is one issue second issue I am
just focusing on been gone only to of
the Bengal politicians say Mukul Roy he
was also named in those kind of scams
that we talked about
he joined BJP now he is a clean person
what it's IPS officer
soon the governor of Bengal has
investigated and I understand that there
are cases against her I am told today
she has joined BJP and she has been
probably made clean after joining BJP
know because BJP is now considered the
ganges of Indian Amazo so this is the
purifier gaya job BJP pending here Babu
Raja
that's the directive of its Malviya
exactly exactly
that is the matter to my straight I
respond to that because he talks a lot
of things about how he explains that I'm
it you know I said initially whooping as
well that this matter started getting
investigated way back in 2013 and there
have been three TMC MPs who have
different point in times mean questioned
by the agencies Mamta Banerjee never
made any human cry about that why is it
that now for a police commissioner who
understands law much better than
politicians I would think mums our
Banerjee is taking her political capital
I reckon Rajeev Kumar is not a member of
the TMC but the way he sat in that Donna
just tells you that perhaps he knows
something that mum time energy fears if
it had to come out there will be a lot
of destruction within the TMC and a lot
of people would get exposed the reality
is no pain that $20 in all scam to the
tool about 40,000 crore is what people
are expecting has happened under the TMC
is watch and here we have Mamata
Banerjee who thinks that she will not
allow any investigation to happen
it's like saying corruption is fine as
long as it's happens in Bengal and Mamta
Banerjee logs over it unfortunately in a
federal structure Mamata Banerjee is the
Chief Minister and their various
agencies there's a constitutional
framework under which we all work but
the important question remains that is
this political opportunism and coming
together of various disparate groups
including the Congress whose leadership
is currently out on bail them
sells in the National Herald scam have
any legitimacy in speaking about
corruption or trying to seek political
refuge in the name of crackdown against
corruption I mean it just doesn't quite
stack document I just love how will you
answer this Banerjee yourself knows it
if tomorrow Prime Minister Modi or Amit
Shah say look at us we've gone to the
extent of dragging Christian Michele and
Deepak salvar and all these other
characters Vijay Mallya from very
various corners of the world and look at
our own opponents they are objecting
they refuse to appear before our
investigating agencies don't you think
the Congress will end up damaging its
own brand as well by standing in
solidarity with montebello Jilin you
know Congress has always been on the
side of the noise you know all these
investigations and all the eff fires
that were launched in the past
everyone has faced the trials everyone
has gone before the law and so there is
no question of Congress ducting the lord
of legal processes here is an issue that
well you are doing something that is the
hoarsely Constitution the horse the due
process of law and that is where one
more institution you are destroying and
so let us say the institutions of the
country it sounds well it sounds well
but why should the layperson if the
Kolkata Police Commissioner has to
answer a few questions before the CBI
now whether he answers at his own
residence or he answer there CBI office
or he answers wherever why should he not
answer these questions please tell me no
no he is bound to answer in an
investigation anyone is bound to answer
no no there are I I don't know that will
come out tomorrow before the Honorable
FX code but the fact remains that when
you are prosecuting or when you are
investigating a public officer and you
have to follow the due process of law
you have to get an order from the
magistrate you have to get a sanction
you have to follow the Prevention of
Corruption Act you also have to follow
the CRPD now we are nothing has been
followed me just fine look at the graph
t of the investigation and look at the
manner in which I'm just wondering I
mean one person whether in the garden in
in the hope of challenging moody in the
hope of challenging Moody I hope the
opposition is not box itself into a
corner where all of you will end up
being tainted with the same brush so
panache Gupta has had a genuine fear
anyone who's not with the BJP now we can
take you to the pinch of salt I'm saying
maybe the BJP is a modern tech Daniel
you enter the VW get purified but in
this current day scenario if you are not
with the BJP is the entire rank and file
of the political class in the opposition
so for looking like a bunch of people
all out there to protect their own self
vested interests well I think there
certainly there are certain the types
you know in which you talk about the
destruction of institutions you're
talking about lack of procedures etc etc
I mean I'm sure there must have been
some violation of procedure and the
extradition of at least two of the
gentlemen who were taken from the UAE
but the point is effective net results
forgot in this case what I think what
you are talking about is the political
will and determination and I think on
that count
mr. Modi at present is scoring very very
highly
that's the grill he is showing that yes
he is determined now I am NOT a expert
on what are the procedures of law
etcetera etcetera because it is I think
not very procedurally regular for the
police commissioner of Kolkata to
actually join in the dhaarana and I
think it is also wrong for the police
commissioner of Kolkata to not want to
cooperate with the investigative
agencies nobody is threatening him with
arrest after all he was a central figure
in the initial investigation at there
when it was filed in the beador Nagar
police station where he was there so he
is a key witness key person who must
cooperate in the largest charity yes you
can ask the question it should have been
speeded up for posture but the point is
that if you're talking about optics if
you're talking about politics the
question is at present
who has the determination and secondly
the question will be asked why does
mamta banerjee go out of her way to
actually want to defend not one of her
party colleagues but a court of police
commissioner
the police commissioner why would a
Calcutta police commissioner who would
have taken allegiance who were taken
oath on the Indian Constitution why
would he think in terms of not sharing
information with people who are fellow
officers of doing and sharing stage with
the politician who happens to be the
state chief minister thanks to all of
you for joining us on this edition of
view point mum type energy may well be
thinking that she's emerged as some kind
of a rallying figure for the opposition
but I think specifically in the context
of this dramatic development which has
just happened
where potential of Vijay Mallya being
brought back to India is now looking
very very bright and he may well be back
before the looks of my elections how
will those opposition politicians or
challenging Modi on the corruption front
how will they manage to mount a
challenge before voting on that
corruption story I think is a
fundamental point to ponder over on the
dirty 2000

this is reporters project and we have
stories from Kerala and Hotel Pradesh
for you today it was an announcement
that's made ripples and is continuing to
make ripples in the highly charged
political environment as we head into
the general elections I'm talking of
course of the appointment of Priyanka
Gandhi Vadra as general secretary of the
Congress party in charge of eastern yupi
now much has been said about how this
will impact the fortunes of the party
but the question is how are workers on
the ground reacting to this appointment
and what advice do they have for
Priyanka Zev of RC hits the road to find
out eastern Uttar Pradesh is where the
Congress party has its roots more than
10 Congress working presidents and the
first Prime Minister of India chavala
Nehru belonged him but today Varanasi
the heart of Eastern yupi like much of
the region is the home turf of party
Ajanta party Prime Minister now Moody's
very own constituency the region like
much of the state has slipped away from
the age-old Congress party now yet
another fourth generation Gandhi enters
politics her great grandfather
grandmother and father have all won
elections here that made them prime
minister
but it has been a massive downhill slide
for the Congress in the past 30 years it
hasn't won a single Assembly election
and it's last noteworthy performance was
in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections when it
won 21 seats more than half of those
came from this region of a pepper dish
over time it has ceded its core support
groups to other parties so if the Dalits
and minorities have sided with the
Bahujan Samaj and Samajwadi parties the
Brahmins have flocked to the BJP the
desertion has been so massive that today
the Congress has just two looks of our
seats in the state both of them the
Gandhi bastions of Amity and drive
really in the state we have not been
doing so well our numbers in terms of
MLAs and representatives have been going
down that is a fact one can deny we've
gone from 28 to 7 this time around we
also contested 2017 as part of a good
one then which didn't quite work out on
the ground we are looking to rebuild the
party as well you know because I mean
one of the reasons for not performing so
well is that you know your your party
structure has to be so robust that it
can you know bring in the votes and I
think that's one of the one of their
focus areas is going to be that
it is against this backdrop that
Priyanka Gandhi Vajra meets her formal
political debut
besides her role as confidant an advisor
to both Sonia and Rahul Gandhi her
hands-on experience has been limited to
a meaty and ribéry lead in her new role
the primary challenge will be to pretty
much build up the party from scratch the
biggest impact of electoral defeats has
been on Congress workers many of them
have left and the ones who remain are
demoralized 40-year old noggin Reporter
has been a car ricotta for half his life
and has worked in both Varanasi and
merciful he's seen the steady
marginalization of workers and has
experienced what the party has assessed
that in the last three elections there
were no Congress workers in as many as
25% of the polling booths were an attack

Vadra taking charge
Nagendra is hopeful that the party
leadership will engage directly with
workers like him
he says the interpersonal communication
between leaders and ground level workers
is very poor and the state leadership is
clueless about ground realities the fact
that workers were opposed to the
alliance with the Samajwadi Party in
2017 was ignored yeah who do you mean

here in Mills up or it's a tough fight
for the Congress party the joke within
the internal circle is that there are
more natha's than carioca tarsier and
this is because there hasn't been a
single major congress victory over the
past two decades in the region now the
looks of a constituency is divided
between the upper castes and petals and
Dalits and Muslims the question is will
Priyanka Gandhi be able to make a dent
into the SP BSP gut Bunton or will she
be able to woo back the disenchanted
Brahmins and upper castes who used to be
traditionally with the Congress now that
is something that the Congress workers
on the ground are hoping for a more bold
chapter here or a hunk a local Congress
- he would protect a licking Modi ji

Priyanka's appealed to brahmins is a

we've been going around village to

that we get from our old
and we see everyday that there are new
people that want to align with the
Congress they see a better future for
themselves in the Congress they see a
better future for East European with the
Congress out of the forty two seats in
eastern Uttar Pradesh Priyanka Gandhi
Vadra will focus on 15 key
constituency's where the Congress can
hope for a revival
these include Kushinagar KD bar a bunkie

under her leadership and we're going to
make sure that in 2019 East u P plays a
significant role in making Rahul Gandhi
the Prime Minister of India an internal
survey of the Congress has found that
farmer distress unemployment and women
safety are the biggest issues for voters
in 2019 while most people in Varanasi
vouch for Modi's work as their local MP
some say that Priyanka offers a new

not likely to contest against moody or
even contest at all they are happy to

speaking to Congress both level workers
on the ground and getting a sense of
eastern Uttar Pradesh especially here in
Varanasi one thing is clear the Priyanka
Gandhi is debut is less about defeating
Prime Minister Modi in the upcoming
loops of high elections but more about
strengthening the party card or
neutralization with an eye on 2020 -
well it seems like the Congress party
has a long term strategy in mind and
Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has a long
challenging road ahead but whatever the
outcome the elections have just gotten
more exciting and will become even more
exciting if the party is bold enough to
get Priyanka to contest the elections

18 reporters have fanned out across the
country to record your stories the
Catholic community and the entire
country were jolted last year when a
group of Mullaly nuns confronted the
church for having failed to hear or
provide justice to a nun who alleged
that she had been raped repeatedly by
Jolanda bishop Franco melaka well
Malakal was finally arrested but he's
now out on bail and the kerala police is
still to file a charge sheet what's
become of those nuns the women who
confronted not just the power of this
man but also the power of the church
aishwarya kumar travels to the convent
in kerala where these nuns live and she
finds a band of sisters who's a needed
goal is to stay together as the law
takes its long course
about an hour and a half from Kochi is a
small town called kuru villengard
nothing sets it apart from other small
towns in Kerala except that it's the
epicenter of a controversy that's shaken
up the Catholic Church once here a
narrow tree-lined tarred road leads you
to the missionaries of Jesus convent six
women joined not only by their faith in
God but also by their fight for justice
have made this their home meet sister
Alfea sister Anupama sister Josephine
sister Nina rose and sister and setter
they left their convents in Jharkhand
and Bihar and moved here in May last
year putting their own ordered lives at
risk
to show solidarity with and protect
their friend the nun from this convent
who shook the Catholic Church and the
country with her accusation of rape last
year aged between thirty and forty five
years each of these nuns had met the
survivor at different stages in their
lives to believe that Franco malakal the
Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of
Jolanda had raped her repeatedly was not
difficult at all to band together and

this experience has put the spotlight on
the role of women in the Catholic Church
the Nancy
they chose the veil because of the
humanness associated with the vocation
and their case is more about a
particular instance of criminality
rather than an issue of gender
inequality women are welcomed into the
church and play active roles like
heading convents schools and taking part
in the church administration but they
don't find a place in the upper echelons
of the institution the Holy Order with
Jesus is believed to have established
allows only men to be ordained okay I
found on I'm sure jr. I seen here I can
happen a junior on battle-ax junior to
senior the Catholic Church might
venerate Virgin Mary as the mother of
God and the Queen of Heaven but is
severely criticized for upholding
patriarchal structures father Varghese
from the kerala Catholic Bishops Council
admits that this case has damaged the
image of the church but he's not yet
ready to explain why the church handled
matters so poorly saying instead that
the charges against malakal haven't yet
been proven it has I mean troubled the
people the conscience of the people so
they are I mean even now they are you
know they are looking forward but what
really has happened and why the church
is not clearly telling this is clearly
the story or this is clearly you know
that kind of a full narrative of course
people will be looking for that full
narrative and I think I know the court
will decide first of all and then church
will also will you know look into the
whole details and then you know we'll
have to tell the people what exactly has
happened
meanwhile the nuns at the center of the
storm continued to be vulnerable convent
authorities have warned them to obey
transfer orders that asked them to
return to their original convents they
are hoping the state Chief Minister will
intervene on their behalf if it actually
comes to they're being thrown out
they say this is to get them to disband
and isolate the survivor none they are
not prepared to do that
as they know the immense stole this
experience has taken on her a woman they
say is the kindest person they have met

Riley went already on onion can he get
enough faith for many goes beyond belief
and transcends into action now will that
action help in bringing forth more cases
of abuse and misconduct in the church
and will that dwindle people's faith in
God as a church rallies to maintain its
image in the public domain what remains
to be seen is whether people's faith in
God overthrows those who abuse it or
overpowers those who challenge it
those incredible nuns are keeping the
faith there their story highlights once

think when a glass breaks or something
it is a good omen depends what kind of a
character you playing you can actually
be a specific something that you know is
comforting maybe some you know sort of
shoes or cycling shorts or something
which won't show in the film but you're
taking because it's comforting for that
character I prefer Kirk Akana if the set
is close by otherwise it's a big
struggle you really don't know what to
order it though if the set is too far
off you know it's you're in trouble then
that day I could never do that and the
days when I have to do it do it I feel
those are one of those really lazy bad
days otherwise I plan my schedule like
that whether I get minimum sleep or not
I like to be up and I like to have
coffee to stay up even if I have to back
wait in the van I would still like to
prefer to stay up rather than to doze
off
yes I do
its initial days when you are free of
the phone because you're so soaked sort
of you into it and and then later on
when you comfortable then it's just like
another day and you're like why are you
checking the same news so many times no
I don't I don't like to carry the burden
of my past must have been so many I
think I was just in on mental said there
was such an embarrassing moment so I was
wearing cop uniform because they were
supposed to be one sequence like that
and I told my it was just a shot that
they had to click in the film so I told
the designer that these pants are tight
for me and she was like this is just one
shot one shot so pre-cast put the camera
and I was behind I and I was posing
posing and my pants tore apart and and
then and what was that what was that and
way before you think the worse I should
tell them I said no no this is my
passion
must be from manikarnika because you
know like coming first to the set and
then staying all throughout other actors
scene and then prepping for the next day
with a DS with the team and all of that

Nitin Gadkari makes some unexpected ...,2019-02-01T16:28:58Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j8ENGHP2MX4/hqdefault.jpg,"people of India worry not if you haven't
understood the budget we are here to
make it easy for you I'm dr. Cyrus Rocha
economists under the teacher the budget
2019 in just three easy steps five six
[Music]
okay to talk about budget 2019 2020
because I know that budget as well but
I'll stick with this did pure scorer
Goyal according to the opposition he was
offside decoding the budget I will just
say this when puce comes to shop let's
look at it the budget 2019 the first
question all the experts discuss right
at the top of this whole budget thing
was where is Pierce geez mustache is it
a metaphor shave the mustache shave the
tax anyway in Mumbai senior citizens
wanted that PP has raised to 10 percent
good good but I expect fuel prices to go
up after the elections so actually
reaching a Provident Fund will be
unaffordable
it's the interim budget by the way just
like Pierce Goyal is the interim finance
minister and the Lok Sabha MPs are the
interim MPs because India will go to
vote in a few weeks and some of the
empties won't be coming back so then the
big question is are we an interim public
will they be replacing all of our
citizens in a few years as well think
about all this as you get into points
from the budget highlighted by myself
expert economics
okay so let's look at the highlights
unemployment at a forty-five year high
well I'm 45 and I've never been employed
so proof
homes and toilets were all by 2022 now
in Mumbai is a little different because
of space constraints we are still to see
the difference between the two home
toilet cover again same thing and the FM
spoke of three lakh crore rupees that
have been recovered from defaulters
apparently many of them are in the
opposition see he looked while saying
default oh I caught that look okay poor
I have the first write on India's
resources as the FM poor have the first
write on India's resources like Delhi
Gymkhana family me like golden dragon
jobs and ONGC and electricity for all by
March 2019
of course those areas with no
electricity have no idea about this
promise as they obviously couldn't watch
the budget for those who were listening
to the budget there were lots of good
news great news in fact especially if
those listening were cows but in keeping
with deep divisions that are the
hallmark of Indian society ladies and
gentlemen Bulls buffaloes bullocks and
horses ignored again also good news for
small farmers however the f-m didn't
clarify what is the yardstick for a
small farmer I was going with like four
foot nine and great news for comedians
the government has special schemes for
UI Shakti start-up India and stand up
India the worst moment in my life
according to the FM thanks to the
present government an arise now feel
secure finally let me tell you sir inner
eyes always feel secure that's why they
left the country to feel secure
everything through computer in terms of
tax no human interference in tax
verification of course some members of
the business community asked for no
interference in tax verification
whatsoever
too much I play too much oh good news if
you own two houses to maintain two
houses you will be spared from notional
rent on your second house I repeat if
you maintain two houses not two spouses
there are a couple of people who
actually misheard that across the
country there's at least three people
finally appears Doyle is a personal
friend I have met him four times and if
you know me if you met me once you never
meet me again so four times personal
friend we now give you the week that
wasn't waiting - this year's budget is

some unexpected remarks and the debate
on dynastic politics goes on there's
some in the top story yo te pou let's
start with I oh yeah that's right I use
a place where you can park your car on
your way to a disputed site to find a
way now we know that it is a disputed
site and that the matter is in the
Supreme Court but the disputed area is
just point three one three acres while
the rest of the excess land remains
undisputed but in a status quo now this
week the BJP government moved the
Supreme Court don't panic it's in Delhi
only it's just a figure of speech and
seeks its permission to return the
excess land to the Ram Janmabhoomi Nia's
and other original owners now I'm
guessing so that the temple construction
can begin that was the whole reason
joining us now are the people who matter
let's see what their opinions are on
this disputed issue so mean to hamari
not behave
you call a matter called me hey Kuna see

issue we are still in the same position
but we do know that there are great
eating places in I would yeah so if
you're passing through on your way to
look at the site please enjoy some of
the best food India has to offer and now
let's move on to CK CK Conair chucko
chucko chucko well she is in the news
ex-ceo and managing director Chanda
Kochhar has been officially sacked by
the bank and both she and her husband
have been accused of criminal conspiracy
and cheating Indians and cheating I've
never ever heard of cheating of course
by the CBI who has accused them for
alleged irregularities in a loan of
rupees
3,250 crore which is my budget for the
year for the show and that was superb
Videocon group video gone let's talk to
an alleged ICICI spokesperson to find
out what happened sir hello we would
like to find out what happened to mrs.
ko Channel I see
oh yeah whether she is really guilty I
see and the who is the right person to
talk to
I answer to your three questions I see I
see I get it really are you a rep of the
ICICI or just one of those laughter
challenge guys who hangs around parelle
for some reason yes okay okay let's go
on do you personally know mrs. Chang
Makoto of course I was instrumental in
hiring her 30 years ago I trained her in
fact I was her first financial coach 33
33 - 30 mins over three individuals
three years old first financial coach
yes I used to coach her get it kocha
Chanda Kochhar
I got it immediately the problem is the
few people who watch my show won't get
it and would not like it at all
exactly happened moving back to the
issue what happened nothing really
happened she gave a loan of rupees 3,250
crore to the Videocon group what is the
big problem she just made one one
mistake it's always this one mistake
what is this mistake instead of giving
the three thousand 250 crore to Videocon
directly she should have made a ghost
transaction did you see a ghost
transaction a ghost transaction it's
perfect well Videocon oh you've lost me
why is a ghost transaction perfect for
Videocon because Videocon is owned by a
booth when you go pal booth it's not
buuut its booth the name is booth it's
not the same thing oh really all right
I'm gonna compose myself and get back to
the issue at hand do you know anything
and also anything about this whole thing
what is your next question okay what
about the issue of conflict of interest
there was absolutely no issue about
conflict of interest what are you saying
Chanda coach's husband was involved in
the deal so I mean her husband is the
so-called conflict of interest nonsense
the husband had clearly decided that
they were not paying back the loan
neither was he going to pay an interest
so where is the conflict in this
marriages where's the interest
okay what about sunder quarters lack of
diligence I will repeat that lack of
diligence that is correct if she had no
lack of diligence this would never have
happened
do you even know what lack of diligence
means of course I know what do you think
I am all right so what is lack of
diligence go on lack of diligence is
when you don't know anybody in Dilip be
dealing lack of diligence diligence and
that is why Chanda Kochhar is in trouble
what comes after lack of diligence
karora of diligence what do you do okay
bye Whoopie - okay this is the standard
let's go to the same point together
anyway give up one last question
why have Videocon defaulted I mean why
they not returning the money they forgot
it was a loan and thought it was a
donation
I thought it was a donation when they
wanted a loan they were told go ask
timber they misunderstood misunderstood
they thought they had to go and ask for
Chanda you know Chandra Deva leakage and
again Pataca Chanda oh you are not Hindu
you won't understand what do you have to
do that don't do that very secular
country don't point at who are you who
are you
and for the record I'm one-eighth Hindu
because of all the people around me I'm
almost like 9 to 10 percent you know let
me tell you on Tuesday I don't eat red
meat
hello why you will take a break who are
you to question my religious preferences
and in fact more inclined to look
towards the East for spiritual guidance
where TMC is ruling welcome back
what a budget ladies gentleman what a
budget I know what I was thinking since
every channel will be talking about the
budget I'll say nothing I'll be
different I'll say nothing I will say
not a word about the budget I will never
speak of the budget because I don't have
the budget for the budget let's start
with a fleet the Union Minister
nathangood curry has been making offhand
statements that are seemingly veiled
attacks at the top BJP leadership will
stop BJP leadership Prime Minister is Mr
curry being backed by the RSS as an
alternative power center let's go
straight to Delhi and speak to alleged
longtime associate an alleged
spokesperson of the same curry friend of
the show mr. Jatin mercury mercury
because he HEPA Haley hi sorry
Kabir Lao zindagi light because the same
song the same song yes I have been
singing the same song since the day I
appeared on your show but now at least
do you understand the significance of
life in politics in politics no I didn't
get that no that's listen carefully
again
BJP I say hippo Haley hi DG a little
something to be safe be very careful
let's come to the statements Gandhiji
has made against the BJP leadership he
has been quite outspoken really what has
he said well after the BJP lost three
assembly elections not one not three
he immediately made a statement that
said leadership should have the guts to
own up to defeats and failures and take
responsibility and no song see when two
cooks are trying to make three dishes
all by themselves say for example one
biryani one tandoori and one doll if the
biryani gets burnt and the tandoori
tastes bad and the doll get spoiled
Who am I going to blame the two cooks or
the customer the two folks and the
management and check out their fire
permit
I don't know on top of that they want to
make everything vegetarian guys
now you're touching a call also be
careful what about the accusation gutter
eg recently made and I am quoting again
that politicians who sold dreams to
people but failed to make those dreams
into reality would get beaten up by the
public beaten up by the public what is
there to explain in this statement it is
how very simple statement I have to
please explain it's a violent statement
see other day good courage II and I was
invited to a party though
most had said you must come you must
come and he promised we have long buffet
table with lots of food now not only did

question I want to ask you sir and it's
off the record and I'll say slowly and
softly is Modi ji invited to the party

if you rely on Akkad anomic this is
what's gonna happen you need to
concentrate on and and take care of
people's concerns on the Internet at our
controversy any retiree ba da da Matta
pune a DHT Ayesha Takia
the NSS or jobs report showing
unemployment of 6.1% a 45 year high has
sparked the political firestorm and a
caustic war of words between the
Congress and the BJP Rahul Gandhi drew
first blood referring to Prime Minister
Narendra Modi as for saying there has
been a national disaster and the Prime
Minister which he claims has left six
point five crore youth jobless even a I
am I am chief Asaduddin Owaisi hit out
at the Moody Sarkar asking how's the
Josh know how other jobs
the BJP was quick to hit back on Twitter
calling Rahul Gandhi a short sighted
Mussolini who has not held a proper job
in his life
the government has revised GDP growth to
7.2% that news just came in few minutes
back and the needy eye of Wiese ovc has
just a short while back held a press
conference saying that the growth rate
shows there is enough proof of job
creation just a day before the budget
another political war has erupted over
the economy can the opposition corner
the Modi government on this or can the
moody circle change the narrative in its
favor ahead of the polls using this data
I think is not the right thing to do and
the reason for that is very simple the
reason for that is that this this data
is still being looked at because we have
to we have to publish the quarter on
quarter report because that is the right
thing to do real terms neither side
person to growth Oriya the nominal terms
may come sircome yada baba percent say

a key other employment name Bulow
let me bring in my guests Gaurav
Chaudhary is the deputy executive editor
of money control.com professor Gaurav
Allah is the spokesperson of the
Congress and Zafar Islam is representing
the BJP before I go to the politicians
let me bring in God a first Guara I'm
trying to understand the government has
revised the GDPs so clearly showcasing
that as far as the numbers are concerned
the Indian economy is on an upswing it
is the fastest growing economy in the
world but at the same time NSSO says
that the job creation remains a gray
area and it is at four decades low that
is right so so where is the story the
story and the missing narrative is that
engage among only you know in guys only
one of those major economics in the
world that does not have a good job
collection data and probably it is about
time that we come up with a good robust
credible jobs data without jobs and
employment data policy cannot be guided
we need this data if if this data is if
this if this report is it has been
prepared it needs to be put out in
public domain and we need to know if
jobs have been not being created and
then the policymakers need to know even
more jobs have been created the
policymakers need to know we need to
know how many jobs have been created
within a particular period of time that
period of time can be chosen depending
on what the policymakers thinks is not
appropriate to be but if jobs are not
being created that's a problem and
policy needs to be guided towards that
absorbing creative then public policy is
working yes why is the government trying
to hide this report and let's not forget
so for Islam that the government has
suspended the Labor Ministry is
quarterly surveys since 2000 16 is where
the government is not trying to hide
this report the government said that
there are some discrepancies and the
apprehension has also been expressed by
some of the members a member of this
commission as well but what is important
as he rightly pointed out that there the
biggest challenge the government is
facing that there is no institution or
organization which can give you one a
real-time basis what is the mid-level
minister only captures the data of eight
ministries that's all but but but
the overall like in the developed world
if you see the payroll misses payroll
data is available on a real-time basis
unfortunately we do not have any India
so we cannot say with certainty that
Hommage job you have been able to create
on how much job in the the industry has
lost but what is important that the we
have put in a system and the nathie IOB
working on that that to create a robots
approach and a mechanism that you can
get payroll data on a real-time basis we
have mechanism like for instance with
some data is available
EPA for to understand that argument of
EPA for versus NSSO
so let me bring in well I mean that's a
good beginning to make actually if you
are trying to come out with a payroll
data which is comparable which is
credible which is a good beginning to
make but please remember one thing 90%
of the jobs in India how do you capture
that payroll data is only going to give
you data about jobs created system and
it sister actually it wasn't attempt to
do that yes but you know what about them
here is Rahul Gandhi talking about this
report and of course I have a problem
with the BJP which is storming this
report that has come in a newspaper that
it's fake because NSSO has been the most
authentic and credible for decades and
you should not be questioning the manner
in which you're dismissing every
institution I mean I am trying to
understand on one hand you talk about
universal basic income that is not
really a solution you have not proposed
any idea for creation of jobs it's not
universal basic income first of all
that's a minimum income guarantee which
is altogether different from ubi I will
share thoughts on that but your question
that growth is there but jobs are not
there why because GDP number is
targeting only formal economy informal
economy is not captured in the GDP
number and informal economy and
unorganized sector went for a toss after
a scam called SD monetization
post D monetization and Gabbar Singh tax
am a semi sector only because this is
the survey by IMO and PhD Chamber of
Commerce
and State Bank of India our post D
monetization in MSME there is a 35% job
loss first sector second there is a
agrarian crisis so why there is an
agrarian crisis because WPI or prices of
the food products are coming down and
the essential commodities which a farmer
has to buy their prices is shooting up
so farmers are moving from the farm to
the non farm but non farm work because
they killed an organized sector that is
the real reason of this crisis this is
not the crisis which Indian economy at
this is multi made crisis because of its
camcorders D wanted again the criticism
is that the D monetization was about big
optics it's about winning elections it's
about sending a message good Eve a
miracle and I here lick in the real
impact has been on the Indian economy
and it's not a positive one not at all
in fact you cannot see one structural
reforms in isolation you have to see all
the structural reforms together because
the Government of India and the under
the leadership honorable prime minister
have done where they have taken majors
where of reform ages and these are all
structural reform which is important and
the monetization is one of them but let
me tell you he is talking about the
farmers I think the statistics suggest
something else what him in the narrative
he is giving during UPA
2004 to 2014 yes the status is in front
of everyone what is the inflation rate
weighted average inflation is eight
point nine percent and the the MSP what
they have given the weighted average is
four point four percent so the result is
that the the the farmers were actually
buying everything at a very expensive
price during our time the inflation rate
has come off and input cast cost come
has come off and or and above we have
given a better a manometry
so the the narrative which they are
trying to build about farmerie
absolutely absolutely on a gradient
crisis I was in Mansoura we had
discussed that even then in Mansour BJP
wins six out of seven seats which means
that the gradient crisis that we talked
about if it was not about electoral
validation that the people in
Madiba desh gave then then I am trying
to understand I did not sense that a
gradient
in Munhall which was the epicenter of
the farmers protests and we saw farmers
dumping produce on the roads in one sort
but the fact that they did not translate
into an electoral setback for the BJP
does not mean I mean we don't we should
we should refrain from establishing a
cause and effect relationship between
agrarian crisis that may have happened
and electoral results that is one but
second the important thing that we need
to look out for here is what is
happening to rural wages there is a
there is a worrying trend in rural rages
rural wages have actually come down in
all remain flat in real terms that's
inflation adjusted real wages have
remained flat and a primary reason for
that probably could be a demon II
monetization induce shock in the
property market so people who are
working in the property market
improperly project the realist will
appear in the real estate construction
activity in real estate which engages
the largest number of unskilled laborers
would have moved back to the villages
that have led toward supply enhancement
of laborers vying for the same job of
basic tilling and plowing so and that is
death of Mohammed distress is a reality
according to our distress is a reality
because we know they are suffering from
something called the curse of
productivity they produced more for
earning less yes and that is something
that needs to be addressed the actual
problem I just want to say that if still
the ruling party feels that there are
enough jobs they want to say that
economics is wrong why I am saying that
jobs can be created only when there is a
gross fixed capital formation in the
economy which is all-time low jobs can
be created when there is a capex
investment in private sector which is
reduced by 67% jobs can be created when
there is a public investment in the
capex which is reduced by 37% jobs can
be created when there is a FDI inflow
which is day by day reducing jobs can be
created when FDI outflow is low now the
FDI outflow is doubled of the last year
jobs can be created when days a credit
growth by banks they had killed the
banks in weather responders atlases and
when you had killed the Berean sector
Mario can you create a job and still if
they want to say there is no response
every single
second stream if still they feel that
there is no rural distress there are
enough number of jobs they want to say
all economic theories are wrong CMI data
which is a household survey which is
most authentic job data survey says that
one crow 12 left law people had lost the
job in one calendar year of 2018 they
are saying three corrode people are
looking for the job is still my friends
Congress party need to be ashamed
what is the question where is the
question of denial I am saying that when
there you are building a narrative
there's absence of jobs there is
unemployment that is growing then you
need to mari i you don't have first of
all i do i completely disagree with the
support you must see where your own
organization has published a report
analytical report on this report of a cm
i at they have contradicted what are the
findings of cm i purely because this is
absolutely business secondly and i I
would suggest that first of quit no and
and you keep on this missing data that
is brought out first of all they're just
talking about economy economy is in sort
footing they GDP growth is there they
every single parameters if you see
everything is talking much much much
better than what it was terrible in 2014
then you have to see the other
allegation made by Congress party that
job is not create job has been created
payrolls suggest that there has been
created
no 93 percent informal sector non let me
ninety three percent is an informal
sector there is no collect there is no
way you can collect data
if anybody claims that there is a data
absolutely in a year these are all
survey based on certain household survey
but and also what does they talk about
this is he my report is first of all
it's incredible I mean I I and secondly
secondly that the what does it suggest
that women women
have stopped working 93 or 63% of women
I don't think so it's right and the men
have not lost job to constantly dismiss
any I'm not there in only after day
monetization after three monetization
after D monetization yes they were
slowed on and we had all anticipated
that they will be slowed down but slowed
down only for a quarter if you see that
just D difficult in that quarter after
the quarter of followed by the D
monetization it has started picking up
today all the structure reforms in place
the new economy is going up the job will
is getting created and the the even the
salaries are two things here one I mean
they are two reports that we're quoting
here one is the CMI report which is a
private sector report and which is which
is a government body and NSSO as we know
is a very credible statistics
organization which we need to keep that
in mind now we need to find out a way of
determining how many jobs have been
created how many people are looking for
jobs and how many people are currently
unemployed or employed there has to be a
baseline scenario we have to come out
with a system where we can capture the
jobs created or the jobs destroyed in
the informal sector because informal
sector we have a bustling informal
economic ninety three percent as I said
ninety two percent of people are there
working in India they are not captured
in the mural data so we have to find out
the ways in eleven to two thousand
twelve here then has the unemployment
was at its peak that is right that is P
that is the reality if we look at that
number because that was the tenure of
UPA - - now yeah how does it work so
that is what I am trying to say if the
NSS of data doesn't come out or is not
put up in public domain we'd not be able
to compare but see my data we can
compare my crore jobs with more than 400
job has been created small enterprise
no because the fur Aslam you're trying
to make a comparison between your tenure
and the UPA the UPA government did not
stop labor ministry reports right they
do not stop the NSSE reports they do not
hide those if indeed jobs have been
created if I were to go with you because
that's certainly good for the Indian
economy good for the people of this
country
then why isn't that data being brought
out in the public domain oh I think the
data has certain anomalies I'm sure that
they'll become the members of the
Commission has made certain observation
I think the indication from the
government that it will come out for
sure but it's the the way in the form it
should come out but it is still data
which you cannot with sitting there no
I'm not given for a second questioning
NSSO but all I'm saying it is based on
the sample survey it is not like every
single job they have identified were
verified then in that case I'm going to
take the second part of my question and
that would be for the no no no give me
give me
there are 750 i has come to remember
seven members and five independent and
to ex officio right now you know what is
the status five independent members had
gone out they have to think the country
has to think that what these guys are
doing only to exhibition was
is that we need to find a way of
collecting jobs data any credible jobs
data we need to have a baseline scenario
and because as I said we have a we are
largely an informal economy we need to
know how many jobs have been created by
people who are Indian but you should
really come to the end of this
discussion for Islam finally what you
know because the question is the
government is facing that question right
if you are facing a question then you
have to come out with data to say that
yes if it's hola
uber
or other sectors people have been
employed but who are they how many of
them and whare D the final take away I
would say we should go back to what you
said in the beginning that if the
government is sure that it created
employment then credible data has to be
brought out in the public domain X
kilometers of roads have been built and
we know roads have been built and the
kind of jobs that these projects would
have created I'm there jobs that have
been created in this kind of projects so
if jobs have been created in this kind
of projects what are the kind of jobs
that have been created how many jobs
have been created compared to her
previous those data it's not it's not a
question of taking quality to sites it's
a question of guiding policy to the most
appropriate and without thank you so
much for joining us Gaurav Chaudhary
Gaurav Allah answer for Islam this is a
debate that is going to continue with
that report that has come out in the
public domain the question is if the
government has created jobs which it has
in certain sectors because of the
development activities particularly
infrastructure which has happened then
it should bring out that data in the
public Vishwa Hindu Parishad stood a
thermal sensor is underway at the Kumbh
Mela in prior garage close to 5,000
seers are present at the event our
meeting essentially to chalk out a route
to construction of
temple in Ayodhya Arce's chief Mohan
Bhagwat reiterated his call to the Modi
government to enable construction of the
Ram temple at the earliest
yesterday's Swami's from Pune and
Saraswathi had thrown a challenge to the
vhp and the government saying a
foundation stone for the Mundell would
be laid on the 21st of next month with
Saad who's ready to brave bullets if
required and shreya is joining me live
from pre Agra shreya good evening so
what does it look like will there be a
final resolution and what are you
picking up what is likely to be there in
the resolution tomorrow hi Maria good
evening to you and to all your viewers
who are joining you on the show before I
answer your question
you know the khumba is quite a sight
it's a sight to behold at night I just
want to show your viewers you know what
the view is from across the river we are
at at the heart of the Yamuna gee what
you see is the comparison right there
all lit up all lit up and absolutely
beautiful but that's not what people are
talking about Mari as you rightly
pointed out tomorrow at the therm sunset
you will see the wrong temple being
discussed you'll have one bucket speak
about it you'll have Baba Ramdev speak
about it you will have over 50 cents in
sales speak about it the question is
when the resolution comes when the vhp
resolution comes from the thumbs
answered can it actually trump swarupa
and saraswathi's resolution which is
saying that after the Besant's none all
the sales which is 500 sales will march
all the way to i/o they are around 21st
of February there'll be a chillon out of
the raman there can they Trump that is
the question today has been a very
interesting day no one was expecting
yogi Adityanath here the chief minister
of Uttar Pradesh but after day before
yesterday's elan by Swami Subin and
saraswathi he flow down no one knew
about it he flow down to meet all the
other Shankar Acharya to meet bond
Pugwash as well to try and lobby support
for his government and what he stole the
Shankar Acharya is essentially this look
we want to build them on there you know
it it's you know where we are coming
from but the fact is the matter is in
the Supreme Court and that is very very
little that the government can do so
let's wait and watch
hey Mauro Mohan bog
speaks on the romm monday tomorrow I'll
see her speak on the Raman there can
they Trump what sir as a sovereign
saraswati has said yesterday is a
question everyone at the converse asking
and essentially and share tomorrow's
also the tarik of the budget here in New
Delhi huge goal will be presenting an
interim budget of the Modi government
the last before the first you know
before the elections and look at the
timing there the call of the Monday here
they talk about development correct
because where is because ask people here
at the comb it's a question I've been
asking should it should an election
before just in the name of the ramen
there as you know yogi Adityanath and
most years here at the khumba making it
and no one seems to be speaking about
because today you know in fact Marya
today was the day when Sabri mana was
discussed for example I you know at the
term Sun Sun no one was interested of
course Mohan Bhagwat spoke a bit about
it evident here arm Dave speak about it
and the rest of the Saints went on their
own trip speaking about the Raman their
the only agenda here at the Kumbh is the
ramen that no one cares about the budget
but the timing is going to be fine I
don't think the news of what happens at
the theorem sunset is going to get
overshadowed by the budget unless
there's some really big announcement
coming in tomorrow from POS oil because
look at the timing the Dharam sensor
starts only at one and by one is
absolutely I expecting a resolution and
by one the budget of splitting the over
resolution comes out yes Angela by one
the budget we have be over I think I'm
timed because they have timed it pretty
well then good title I would say they're
timed it well yes thank you so much
Daniel thank you they're joining us from
pre Agra
that's all from me I'll be seeing you
tomorrow the big budget day and its
simplifications we'll be debating that
tomorrow
thanks for watching

F5TXuKHLzTY,&#39;Minimum Income Guarantee For BPL Families&#39; Rahul&#39;s Promise Before The Polls | Election Epicentre,ElectionEpicentre #RahulGandhi Rahul Gandhi throws brahmastra at the modi sarkar just months before the 2019 LS Polls.,2019-01-29T04:00:02Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F5TXuKHLzTY/hqdefault.jpg,"I heard of the 2019 battery Congress
president Rahul Gandhi has dropped a
bombshell in a clear preemptive strike
against the Modi Sarkar he has promised
a minimum income guarantee for families
below the poverty line calling it a
historic step to eradicate poverty and
hunger calling it his new India Fitch
Rowell Gandhi has called the promises
party's primary wijl but has the
Congress chief really worked out the
math to roll out this ambitious
programme is this just a poll pitch to
corner the Modi regime or is it part of
some kind of well-thought-out welfare
plan is this a game changer or some kind
of Joomla on omics as we are calling it
first let's listen in to what Rahul
Gandhi had said in chapters girl earlier
today Congress party money cigar
guarantee 30 Newton underneath tell each
other here is kamala minimum income
guarantee continuity a bank account may
come second Newton Anthony Hindustan T
sitar tell HR I hear mother in Busan
so rahul gandhi's wage promised as we
are calling it is a Joomla no mix or
game-changer you can call us and share
your views that's the number of flashing
on your television screens zero one two
zero four three four one eight nine five
so what does it really mean has the
Congress president done some kind of
mathematics is the government or is the
Congress really ready for this kind of
promise do they have the resources do
they have the vision or is it just
another attempt to corner the moody
government joining me now Pallavi Gor
she's joining us live from the Congress
headquarters
Pallavi bad economics or good economics
aside this can be debated it will be
seen as historic the timing particularly
Pallavi is very interesting as it was
anticipated that an announcement of
similar kind could happen by the cabinet
to David was which was scheduled for
today and the meeting was thereafter
canceled that's right and not only that
Maria they have all the press conference
which was being done but the HRD
minister also on the job opportunities
when he was talking giving out a job
data and in that context you have this
coming in from Rahul Gandhi and a
promise from the Congress party you want
us to part we win and we are going to
give you income and we are going to give
you jobs that's essentially been the
fulcrum of the Congress party off late
and what we've also reported earlier is
that a manifesto is a Congress party is
working upon is essentially on the
points of giving jobs providing income
stipends equal opportunities also
interestingly minor is also one of the
strongest and the first reactions coming
in from the former Finance Minister and
someone who heads the manifesto
committee of the Congress party as well
who looks at it as a game change and you
apply it here in 2009 2008-2009 the farm
loan wave was clicked for the Congress
party Greece that's what they felt at
that point of time that's how they
marketed it I got word on time it was
seen as very bad economics but certainly
has good politics this many would say
maybe bad economics questions will
certainly be asked about where will the
money come from how
are you going to decide who are you
gonna pay those incomes to but at the
end of their politically speaking when
we are talking about equal opportunities
jobs employment you know all of that in
that context Rahul Gandhi's announcement
or a poll promised Congress certainly
hopes it's gonna go a long long way well
let me tell me you are also in touch
with ministers would you say that the
Congress president has outmaneuvered the
government with this strike I mean I
mean the Congress thought they would
want to look at it in that way because
we're also talking on a time and it's a
speculation as I said it comes
immediately almost at the same time when
that press conference was being held
about job data when he promised that
jobs will be available to all by 2030
we're also talking in the context of a
budget session coming out and we're
talking about a feel-good budget we also
talked in the context of a cabinet
meeting possibly today or anytime soon
which again talks about income
reservations for economically backward
in that sense urging the Congress party
is smug they're smiling they are
confident and they feel that they have
really pulled a fast one on the BJP all
right follow me thank you so much for
joining us so has the Congress pulled a
fast one of what on the BJP let me bring
in my guess
Charu Prager is the spokesperson of the
BJP Shoji Bala is the chairman oxes
investment and a senior economist
Sandhya is a spokesperson of the
Congress Saudis voila let me come to you
before I bring in the political guests
universal basic income sounds appealing
but how difficult is it to find the
resources well you know first of all
what mr. Gandhi has proposed is not
universal basic income and everybody is
very very confused about this including
economists and journalists and all what
is it is what he's proposed is what
several of us have proposed and partly
the government has implemented is what
is called a basic income for the poor
now poverty removal in India has been on
the basis of food grants that is your
PDS on the basis
 that is your jobs on the basis of
subsidies for fertilizers etc and power
and water what the proposal about a
basic income is and should be in my
opinion we move all of these subsidies
and guarantee a minimum income to the
poor what that minimum income to the
poor should be and the poor can be
defined by various criteria if you go by
the Tendulkar poverty line my estimate
is that poverty in India is now down to
about five six percent of the population
clearly the poverty line needs to be
raised in no matter what government
comes in I would think just last thing I
would say I would think that the poverty
in India for any population in advanced
economies as well is now a relative
poverty concept by relative poverty
basically about a quarter to a third of
the population should be considered
absolutely poor and deserving not
absolutely poor relatively poor and
deserving of a guaranteed minimum income
rather than in-kind subsidies that our
governments have done for the last 65
years ok mr. London why has the former
Finance Minister mr. Peter Cameron call
it historic and almost something that
will mark a turning point in the lives
of the poor if you are saying that this
has been in the works that it's almost
like old wine in new bottles a new idea
it's not really a new idea it has been
in the works then why is it being seen
as historic well who is seeing it as
historic I look this is election season
so what do you expected on them to do we
are producing old wine in new bottles
indeed I've argued very consistently for
the last 15 years that the way we levy
at poverty in India which is by giving
food subsidies and raiga
should be disbanded I wrote that
back in 2000 on food subsidies and in
2008-9 when was introduced by this
very government so whenever and
including guaranteed employment the Fair
Employment Act the full Security Act the
entitlement Act and I had said for a
long time that if the Congress were to
come back to power in 2014 they will
bring a and AD to guarantee you
happiness these are politicians
economists have been discussing it for a
long long time and I don't issues
especially in the opposition to say
anything different absolutely bring
before I bring in Sanjay Jha and Charu
Prager let me bring in the callers on
the show dr. Sajjad dr. Sajid is a
resident of canoers
doctor sadiq go ahead yeah I basically
feel you know it's a great move
just like Mantega which was introduced
and it it helped a lot a lot of people a
lot of poor people and I believe that
it's a basic right of every citizen to
have you know a decent income and I
think it's a great move Congress has a
lot of people who can actually work on
it and implement it in a very you know
systematic way and I think it's very
much possible to do that and I think
it's the right step to be taken I think
it's a great move well it's a wonderful
move okay from Bengaluru Sunday Funday
please go ahead yeah good evening Mario
I I feel that this is a game changer if
we keep in mind that it was the Congress
which introduced the manraja which gave
massive employment to the people but
there is one caveat is here the
intention should be clear if he plans to
do another movie on India then we won't
call it a chair a game-changer we will
call it a madea pass but otherwise it's
a welcome move if they intend to
practice it completely all right thank
you so much mr. Pandey let me get
another caller this one from Mumbai luck
Advani please go ahead Lakshmi this is
purely a Joomla how the government will
go on it will be so much burden on the
government just to come just to win this
election
desperately this man is giving a
which I think the people of India will
not accept okay thank you so much
Sanjay Jha three callers two of them
give a thumbs up one says that is Joomla
no mix I'm trying to understand have you
gone through the basics in terms of
questions that could be asked can it be
really launched on a pilot basis and
what will be the basis of identifying
these families now Mario first a
correction to mr. Bhalla there are many
people in politics who have a phenomenal
knowledge of economics so there's no
need to be so cynical and dismissive of
the talent there exists in the political
system
point number two let me tell you the
discussion on providing a minimum income
to the poor has been a work in progress
in the Congress party for a long time
this is not a new phenomenon
point number three in our manifesto
meetings that we have had mr.
Chidambaram heads that there have been
discussions and deliberations with
people from all walks of life and
particularly the oppressed and the
marginalized and you know it better than
me because you discuss it all the time
in the last four years the condition of
those who are living below the poverty
line or at the bottom of the pyramid has
become hugely aggravated because of the
terrible policies of this governed now
look at the farmer distress look at
joblessness what does mr. Gandhi said
he's talking about giving a minimum
basic income to the poor which will be I
think in my opinion a great historical
step going forward because the biggest
problem that we have in our country
today is inequality and the fact that
Indians have died on account of starving
I would say I mean you can't have a
situation where the government of the
day it has not been you know I also that
know it's been thought through I'll give
you an answer to that I will give you an
answer to that I'll give you an answer
to that number one how can we come on TV
Channel shows and urban programs in
India and mr. Boddy will talk about the
words fastest growing economy when
children are stunted and the figure that
mr. Bhalla says is wrong there are
around 20 percent people still living
below the poverty line even those are
the poverty line come below the poverty
line when they have an illness in the
family or they have an income loss so
you know we need to understand the
gigantic nature of the current crisis
absolutely so let me tell you the
economics of how you manage that the
economics of that is by the way a
question of how you look at raising
revenues how you look at cutting
expenditure look at basically ensuring
your those subsidies that are not
productive and minimized and to reduce
my old and very very intelligently that
rule Gandia stolen the Thunder he has
jumped the gun that is what I would say
since 2017 the government the RBI has
been working on something like this but
let me underline the fact that they have
been working on something like this in
2017 the Economic Survey of India
submitted a report in which 40 pages
were written about the universal basic
income scheme now the government is I
repeat working on it that means to come
out in announce before the economics of
something is worked out is basically
jumping the gun he's probably worried
about the budget session which is going
to be underway very soon he is worried
about what might be announced and he's
also worried about where his waters are
going to see him if something good like
this happens for the country I have been
hearing the arguments for centuries you
know going by that argument Charles and
Norman that argument in case if the
government goes ahead and makes an
announcement or something similar to
this in the cabinet then Rahul Gandhi
can say I put the pressure on the
government well you know the first
report which came out in December in the
2018 December 2018 not because they've
been printed India Today printed an
article several other dailies got an
article together I've got the dates over
here I've got the articles you're on my
phone so this conversation started in an
active way in December Rahul Gandhi ji I
repeat has jumped the gun I did not make
a few seconds of fame dropping the
government nothing was stopping the
government is going to announce
something in my depression is why why
would you talk about something this
important and this life-changing in a
casual manner like this without working
out the economics without working out
how the background of this works the
report talks about how you know
so the scheme needs to be how
unconditional it needs to be in which
agency is going to be handling it
everything is being technically and
properly worked out so I I stand by what
I said Rahul Gandhi ji did bring in
sujet Paulo well let me tell you the
difference is that unlike Narendra
Modi's ponderer lakh coming in to bank
accounts the farmers for 5 rupees and 30
into peas they're you know they're
receiving ji dam please don't interrupt
it won't change the truth no but then
then Sanjay Jha going by you know by
trying a ride in 15 lakh rupees sure was
not practical then Rahul Gandhi is also
making promises which cannot be
implemented what is happening with the
farmers in Madhya Pradesh
but what Charu is pointing out that is
also a radio show mario let me assure
you we have already done the necessary
spade work in terms of looking at the
state of gdp what could be the potential
heads of expenditure that will need to
be lui looked at what are the
opportunities in terms of trying to look
at our revenues and ultimately you need
an economy that is growing fundamentally
and not just on a headline or some kind
of you know the truth of the matter is
everybody knows that you care we have
people in the adjoining called Ashok
Krishna is a resident of Yavatmal please
go ahead Krishna Oh ma'am nod this is
definitely a game changer because the
initiative of minimum income guarantee
by mr. Rahul Gandhi we have also seen
that in Chhattisgarh
mother predation in rajasthan he
promised to wave of below no farmers and
he fulfilled that promises so it's high
time we should believe in him and to
eradicate poverty and hunger this is a
great step which is taken by anna i
think we all have to support him and
government must take this thing into
consideration that's what I say
all right thank you so much Malik is a
resident of Chennai please go ahead
yeah yeah yeah do you hear me yes please
two things I want to things very
important P sunless tan to Congress as a
petition for tea
see you yeah H my word just go back to
what I'm saying we come to the reality
1947 runs on independence waters the
country's position nothing there is no
power nothing today 2014 here super
before that I am comfortable we have
gained the top Congress that is one
thing and second is to the a all in a
beginner most of the major TV is really
buyer okay wherever motivos will show
you bgp modey modey what is there is no
fire I'm Justine wonder everybody
working under on predator it is muggy
pressure part of it is reaching this
folly are just watching all the channels
wherever would be a typo he's not a god
area's not done anything you tell me
today's India I am just asking as a
common man who are season is powerful
yeah let it a get ready with computers
everything anything you mobile v6
technologies I am is what is a
journalist car already a lot of things
to this country this is very ingest is
very designer a brief it is encountered
let's look at their husband away from
the circuit Embarcadero basement
paramedic
thank you so much for calling us let me
get the final verse from sergey's
ballast road is Bala we got close to six
scholars and all of them seem to be
suggesting that this is a game changer
move and this would and the Congress
perhaps has the potential of
implementing it so that'll that kind of
endorsement and faith
is-is-is rather interesting and I coming
as it does three months before the
elections well you know it is in the
Gandhi launch gotta be at AU in 1971 and
for the next eight years poverty
actually worsen so let's not you know
game-changer or not what I think and you
know as somebody pointed out earlier the
entire concept of basic income was
completely fleshed out in the economic
survey which is a major policy document
off the government of India which was
produced by this government in 2016-17
that's almost two years ago everybody in
the whole world has been discussing it
and the government have you heard of I
hope your your callers have heard of the
jungin program the mobile program the
money in the bank accounts for food
subsidies for fertilizer subsidies so
this has been as an ongoing process and
the math of it I have written several
articles including one about a month ago
outlining the basic framework of the
minimum income program so let's not call
it a gay it hasn't happened yet Congress
has to be in power but I do think that
the basic income program has been in the
works should be expanded regardless of
which government but please don't tell
me that they just invented the wheel
again I mean enough of this inventing
the wheel yes I'll do on policies and
let's argue where they should be done or
not be done you know you come up in the
morning and say you've just invented
something it's embarrassing
yeah it's not piecemeal alternatives
that we are talking about here thank you
so much Saudis bola de santo chanchad
Oprah guy here in the studio thank you
so much for joining us so it will be
debated whether it's an old wine in the
new bottle or whether it says it has
been in the works and has the government
being really cough
a court of God because it was almost
been planned to be announced in the
cabinet
she was banging on the table and it had
very agitated - it remedies it just
wanted to was asking for the mic take
the mic back from her it's very obvious
that you're trying to take the mic
nothing else Suzumiya a senior leader of
congress the way he has behaved is
shameful and in karnataka also this is a
cognitive elephants Rahul Gandhi should
first take action against his own 3x
chief minister Pharma Karnataka Chief
Minister Siddaramaiah sparked the Rao
after he humiliated a woman for
questioning him during a public meeting
in mysuru the woman questioned see the
Ramaiya saying that his son the local
Emily was inaccessible so there are
mayor lost his cool as snide a mic from
the woman even pulling her dupatta he
even got out from his seat and berated
the woman for questioning him the
National Commission for women has taken
so moto cognizance of the incident and
said they will ask the police to take
action against the former chief minister
and tsunami has finally reacted to the
incident he has tweeted and I'm quoting
him now the incident happened in an
attempt to stop a party workers long
speech at a meeting in warrant today it
was by accident I have known that worker
for 15 years she is like my sister and
court Stacy is joining us on the phone
line Stacy what kind of statement is
this he should have apologized yeah
everyone would have probably waited for
an apology because that's what the
opposition BJP has also been demanding
but like what the woman has also said
that you know she would cheat we'd
figure a man like her brother and under
similar line through my eyes now
replying that she is like my sister I've
known her for more than 15 years
like we said she is she was the
ex-wife's president of the Paulo
Congress so she is definitely known that
was sit there are miles at a previous
constituency he he was the MLA from
Verona in his previous general so it is
more likely that they did know each
other and which is why even
the woman was confronted and asked about
you know what is this kind of behavior
she said that it was it was very normal
determined like a brother and she
wouldn't take offense and if he has to
even actually really have a beat her or
scolded at her but right now what's the
response coming from Superman is just
simply that you know it was an accident
it doesn't it's not what it's looking or
made out to look like she is just she
was I was trying to make you know from
making a long speech and which is why I
was taking the microwave and and that's
you know it's not how it is made out to
be and that's the only defense coming in
no apology at this most moment but what
we do know is that the NCW is taken
through motu cognizance of the incident
and it's asked the Karnataka police now
what action will they take and will they
actually go ahead and you know file and
fi are because the woman herself has
said that there is no reason to be
filing an empire so what would be the
outcome of the still remains to be seen
yes because the woman says that
according to her sitaramayya is like her
brother and Siddaramaiah says this that
she is like her sister but the question
is of propriety I mean these are leaders
senior people in public spaces is this
the manner in which they should be
conducting themselves
that's absolutely right that is going to
be questioned in fact it will sit
Ramaiya during the early half of the day
who was asking for MP an uncommon Hague
these resignations of C units that this
peaceful comment about the fellow
Congress Emily's a wife and dragging a
wife and dragging religion and
polarizing these things were something
that suited America that he should have
taken a moral Joran he should design and
just the later half of the day you see
this incident newsfeed being caught on
camera and which is why the BJP is
definitely making her huge noise about
it and asking for a chief minister
asking for cetera Maya's you know to
step down from essa and take up all the
Congress to take appropriate action even
though he was an ex chief minister but
it remains to be seen what surely will
be done for now only this has a defense
saying that it was just an accident that
has come that's a came about and it's
not what it's made out to be all right
Stacy thank you so much for joining us
National Commission for women has taken
supermoto cognizance and has asked the
State Police to register an F IR what
will be the police action that will be
unfolding we'll continue to track that
story very closely that's all from me

DbnrHyuqU_Y,Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi review by Rajeev Masand,CNN News18 film critic Rajeev Masand reviews this week's new Hindi film Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi starring Kangana ...,2019-01-25T20:15:43Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DbnrHyuqU_Y/hqdefault.jpg,"a biopic of Rani Laxmi by one of the
earliest patriots of a freedom struggle
ought to be a special thing hers is the
inspiring story of a brave young queen
who refused to cede control of her
kingdom to the British following her
husband's death who fought alongside her
troops on the battlefield and who in
1858 at the age of 29 lost her life in
service of the land that icon deserves
crackling film manikarnika the queen of
Jhansi is first and foremost powered by
the passion of its leading lady
caminar on earth is unwavering in her
portrayal of Rani Laxmi Bai there's a
hard to miss intensity in her eyes and
tenacity in her voice she commands the
screen with a fiery arresting presence
never letting your attention wander away
from her in the battle scenes -
galloping on a steed charging in two
rows of enemy soldiers slashing and
tearing into their flesh practically
leaping onto an elephant her valour is
so convincing even the gravity defying
stuff looks very hearty under
frankly the legend of the brave queen is
served well by Kay Rajendra Prasad my
toast building screenplay but the
filmmakers don't seem especially
interested in seeking out the woman
beyond the legend much of the
information we gather during the course
of the film that Rani Laxmi Bai spoke
fluent English had a love for reading
cared deeply for animals and was
fearless in battle but a compassionate
mother is released expressly for the
purpose of highlighting her brilliance
given that the filmmakers declare up
front in an opening slate that they've
taken liberties with facts there's no
way to know how much of it is even
historically accurate yet a handful of
scenes spring to life when informed that
her army pales in size compared to the
enemy's Rani Laxmi Bai delivers a
rousing feminist monologue inspiring the
women of her kingdom to join the men in
battle I call it a full gooseflesh
moment
equally stirring is the song part
composed by Shankar Ehsaan Loy the
battle scenes are impressive and the
film is lacking neither in vision nor
scale the problem is the single track
narrative and its unwillingness to
explore anyone or anything other than
the Rani Laxmi by worshipping angle I
wasn't so bothered about the fact that
the film has little room for other
characters to shine as I was by the
sheer clunkiness on display I know this
is the Bollywood version of a historical
but Rani Laxmi by breaking into a dance
with the locals
takes creative liberties to a whole new
level I was also dismayed by some of the
hackneyed dialogue a British officer
declares in mangled Hindi after being
humiliated by the Queen Basilica Java
McCune Salonga we're still making our
characters talk like that
there isn't a quiet moment or a subtle
note in manikarnika the queen of Jhansi
this is a deliberately simplistic film
an old-fashioned patriotic saga told in
the broadest of strokes and with full
nationalist fervor Kangana Ranaut's
extraordinary performance is the film's
biggest strength playing the woman for
whom they said who bloody Madonna voto
Jerseyville irani tea that unforgettable
line and the image of a female warrior
on horseback a sward raised in one hand
a baby strapped to her back is for many
the first thing that comes to mind when
one mentions Rani Laxmi Bai as it turns
out this film directed by Chris Joe
Vella Moody and Khurana herself doesn't
expand your understanding of the iconic
warrior queen much more I'm going with
two and a half out of five for the film
and an extra half for Colonel aeronauts
terrific performance which makes it 3
out of 5 for manikarnika the queen of
Jhansi

LQzmY-_t_H8,Thackeray Movie Review By Rajeev Masand | Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Bal Thackeray,Thackeray Movie Review By Rajeev Masand CNN News18 film critic Rajeev Masand reviews this week's new Hindi film ...,2019-01-25T18:30:29Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LQzmY-_t_H8/hqdefault.jpg,"a personality like Baltar I can't be
contained in one film he requires a
sequel that is what the makers of chakri
alluded to as the film ends on a to be
continued footnote this is an account of
the Shiv Sena supremo's life produced by
the party's MP Sanjay Raut so we have a
fair idea what to expect
Cochran is a superhero here painted -
the demigod status that his supporters
gave him his words frequently punctuated
by a Tigers roar harshly she mounted
Krishna this is a glowing tribute with
no room for any greys in its
protagonists so it ends up as a
one-sided distorted Safran huge take on
tatras political rise and clout over
Maharashtra to be fair the film directed
by Abhijeet pants-a is engaging in parts
chiefly because it's powered by a
carefully calibrated performance from
nawazuddin siddiqui who breathes life
and fire into the character of the
controversial Hindu - a leader
avianna chili Bela a camera hello Pocoyo
the irony of watching Nawaz mouth
chakras incendiary speeches against
Muslims and against outsiders taking
away jobs from the Marathi Manos will
not be lost the film begins with chakras
appearance in court before the Shri
Krishna Commission when he was accused
of inciting violence against Muslims in
the 92-93 Bombay riots it sets the tone
for this high geography tarae's journey
from a cartoonist in the 1960s to an
iconic political figure is repeatedly
intercut with these court scenes during
which he expresses his extremist views
and reveals his razor wits apakah sapota
Yamla love deeper fed up with him later
Pakistan my brother with the over to our
biopic depicts the Shiv Sena's history
of violence but it's always defended by
today's fiery rhetoric it's the eye for
an eye reaction to action justification
for strong-arm tactics violence and even
murder that make this film difficult to
stomach often the politico is seen
sneering at even the idea of democracy
at one point a jail chakra tells George
Fernandes how the nation needs a Hitler
and Fernandez Riley remarks there is a
dictator born in you
Nawaz has big shoes to fill but he slips
into Tory Skinner impassive impenetrable
at times walking furiously into
situations capturing the magnetism and
mannerisms of Cochran from his love for
cricket his beer-swilling cigar smoking
sat in kurta persona to the indulgent
family man it's a gripping performance
and the film stands on his shoulders
Amrita Rao plays his wife Mina thigh
with all heart especially in one scene
as she breaks down while reading his
letter from jail what hampers the film
is naturally the bias here is a man
without flaws and this results in a
one-note propaganda project it's a shame
because there's some genuine craft on
screen the film is shot skillfully by
Sudeep Chatterjee and early scenes of
Turkish cartoons popping from the page
are nicely done but it's all in service
of a skewed narrative I'm going with 2
out of 5 for TOC ray if there must be a
sequel it calls for more honesty less

order is typically virgin coup de Pury
karma vada nirvana good governance then
land order maintain the will be the
challenges so mr. Chauhan there are two
key issues that seem to be coming
forward as issues that the political
parties including your own will have to
deal with and which you have dealt with
in the last elections one is youth and
employment the BJP at the central level
has just passed the constitutional
amendment which allows for 10 percent
reservation for economically weaker
sections in the upper caste will this be
a game changer
the kiss a much cake bar ever go to

the 10% to the reasoning if someone ever

don't we say BA or sick shadow no may
heaven again a art massage pedicure or
nachito but William and my son to say
when come on represented I in your state
before the elections we spoke to a lot
of young people and there were two big
feedback to two big pieces of feedback
that we got one is that there was
resentment against sc/st reservation and
the second is the Swaraj Karuna that
your government had
to encourage entrepreneurship amongst
really small you know fifty thousand to
two lakh rupee loans that did not really
benefit people the scheme was good
operationally it was May komyatti so do
you feel that this upper caste
reservation will help address this
resentment against sc/st reservation the
ectomy is posted
equivalently medias some kisan sabha
Vikas a movement riveting and Abadi
government ready barbaresco get a

isn't that going to be a big challenge
for the party going forward in the
general election
yeah yeah Jo challenge a equal day's me

L-TRwsQ7JEo,Breaking News: BJP Is In An Alliance With Shiv Sena In The Sena: Claims A BJP Source,A BJP Source tells CNN-News18 that BJP is already ruling the Shiv Sena epicentre Maharashtra. Listen to the report.,2019-01-25T10:06:03Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L-TRwsQ7JEo/hqdefault.jpg,"and top BJP sources that suggests that
shifts in our posturing will not affect
the Alliance which if Cena is what BJP
sources are saying in fact they say that
BJP is running a joint government in the
state and they're also in the center and
they will not mind forming an alliance
in the assembly and on Lok Sabha so my
stay on with us and give us more details
on this we've seen how Shiv Sena has
been posturing for a while now but we
should be really indicating that that
will not that effect affect their
decision in the larger picture
what party sources are saying that the
Shiv Sena you know we were talking about
the saamana which is in a mouthpiece
they're coming out with with Gadhafi is
the Priyanka Gandhi so the view within
the party certainly is that they are an
alliance partner that they are in
government and hence they would want to
be streamed together they would want
that the shifting I should remain an
ally they are pretty optimistic and
hopeful that they'll be another
instrument as it has been and you know
it's one of the oldest allies of the BJP
we have seen the BJP and the ships and I
was running a joint government in the
state of Maharashtra they are also
hidden government in the reason for the
Council of Ministers
in New Delhi as well and hence I think
what the BJP feels is this that whatever
Shiv Sena is doing is largely because of
a domestic constituency and of course
muscle-flexing as the Shiv Sena has done
in Parliament as well on couple of bills
as well so this is this is more on the
surface but as far as the lion stocks
are concerned they are hopeful that
there are channels of communication that
are on with the Shiv Sena we have you
know a senior leaders of the parties in
the parliamentary board listen listen
got curry himself who has been in touch
with the Shiv Sena on a regular basis be
to be present and sell visited the
Cochran mater see also so the indication
certainly wouldn't be from the BJP is
that alliance will not be an issue and
that all alliance any differences at any
stage with alliance partners will be
sorted out and that an alliance with
Shiv Sena will be taking place both at
the you know national
well the elections are a deal for each
month for now and also at the in the
elections in the assembly elections
which are right six months later you
know just minutes ago on CNN news 18 we
broke that news of harsh if Xena in
their mouthpiece said that Priyanka
Gandhi could be a major crowd puller and
the fact that the Congress has inducted
Priyanka Gandhi in a prominent role will
not be Rahul Gandhi's failure so this
pretty much means Mara and the larger
picture that BJP chooses to ignore these
statements and their stance as far as
the Alliance is concerned remains as it
is they are in talks and they will
continue to do so irrespective of these
statements coming in every now and then
where the Shiv Sena is stopping the BJP
well not for the first time that the
Shiv Sena has praised the opposition
leaders if you would remember the Shiv
Sena had also talked about how Rahul
Gandhi when he actually won the three
states the Congress party when they won
the three states they had also said that
this is an indication of things going
you know going away from the BJP so they
have been critical of the BJP their
alliance partners so there is some
nothing new that has come up in chips in
appraising Shankar Gandhi I look at it
from the political messaging point of
view so certainly this is going on they
also understand that from the larger
messaging perspective that this is the
way it will be at that this is the way
the shifts in another lines partners
because this is a time also for
muscle-flexing this is also a time in
which the alliance partners would want
their pound of flesh as far as
contesting seats are concerns the ships
and I would want to contest mercies then
what the BJP has offered so far and you
know because the lion's equation in the
state of Maharashtra has changed what
was earlier the Big Brother
is now the small brother technically
because the BJP has an upper hand in the
state of Maharashtra is expanding its
footprints in the state of Maharashtra
right so the ships and understands that
its space is also shrinking and hence
these kind of editorials is what I'm
getting to know right but at the same
time as far as a loyal sister
what we are getting to know from top BJP
sources and they are pretty confident
that alliance with Shiv Sena will take
place there are many thanks for putting
that into perspective for us

the BJP claims that mamta Banerjee is
scared of the BJP and that she's gone

good attempt but you had the wrong
answer in fact it is exactly the
opposite BJT scared of moms are though
everybody is scared of Mamata Banerjee
she's just a very scary person
yeah I never said that but let's talk
about mr. Shaw's rally in detail okay
you have only 20 seconds in which to ask
a question I asked it in 5 seconds mr.
Shah allegedly said that your Mahad
Bundren has 9 prime ministerial
candidates that may be true but we say
it's better to have nine candidates
running for one prime minister one prime
minister running 39 portfolios
forgive just for the record he also
claimed that the BJP is the only one who
can save Bengal
how can the BJP say big all the BJP are
undemocratic and autocratic democratic
and autocratic Bengal needs a leader
like mamita but but an authoritarian and
totalitarian are right there
thankfully English two different
meanings fair enough mr. Shah claims at
Mamta didi is anti Hindu that is
absolute rubbish
mama daddy is very Pro Hindu she has
said that if any BJP people come to
Bengal she will personally dip them in
the Ganga I don't know how to answer

said in an interview you said that you
don't necessarily see your films as
realistic the endeavor has always been
to create a world that is convincing
what does that really mean given that I
would imagine that creating a world it
is convincing because it because it
feels real no I mean for example if you
look at the world of ever see a Harry
Potter right it's not real at all but
it'll be convincing you know you it has
its it has its own set of rules and you
create the world it's an open world
right but things can happen and you
believe in it you buy into it and it's a
bit like that in so-called realistic
cinema as well true because I mean if
you take for example and let me use an
example of a finger I worked on say a
Maqbool Maqbool is a film that is set in
so-called Bombay in the world where
people are speaking chest or do that who
are these people I mean you know really
who are these people but actually some
many critics actually wrote at that
point such realism is a raw power
realistic it all is completely fantastic
doesn't exist so in that sense is what I
mean you know so if you take a world of
even so until here for the exit yeah it
actually comes and stems from it
originates from some real people it
originates from a real culture that
existed but here are people wielding
guns and really talking about big things
you know so it's an illusion of real
reality but it's actually fantastic oh
yeah okay you know what
bogie high on their porch a bar party
party here but in South Korea
you've described so much area which is
of course your latest film as your most
male film mm-hmm
what is your responsibility given that
you've said you know you've given that
you made that quite clear what is your
responsibility towards female characters
given that that's the kind of film that
you openly declared it is it's um it's a
male film primarily because of the lack
of choice I had in it it's not by design
as such because when when we started
working on the film started reading up
all the characters in that place met a
lot of people I mean number of women
bandits you can actually count in your
little finger they hardly were any one
of which we already made a film on
correct
so it's an intensely male world one of
the reasons why I said that is also
because the film deals with the issue of
gender the idea of gender with with with
discrimination due to gender and I I
think I have only three women characters
in film only one of which is a
protagonist but but these are upper
caste men looking at the idea of being
upper caste and being men so so these
are the questions that they have to ask
themselves you know I asked because I
feel like that disclaimer is frequently
abused by filmmakers do not develop
female characters strongly yeah I mean I
don't mean it's necessarily I'm not
asking you to comment but nothing like
Simba which is the hero story the male
protagonist story why the why because
it's a male protagonist story is that an
excuse to not create nicely fleshed out
female characters and given that a
woman's incident and incident around
around woman becomes the catharsis aura
or or you know the trailers of tons of
understand which didn't have room for
one dialogue between two female
protagonists you find that happens often
that in the guise of by make no make
more male story you make an action film
there is just no that there is just no
time spent on on developing female
characters adequately yes yes and that's
that's that's been the unfortunate part
of our industry for a very very long
time as a matter of fact I mean back
back back in the day when I was growing
up or back in back in the time when I
just joined the industry actually the
number of films which had
women characters with any kind of
character or any agency you could count
on your fingers but most of the films
were like that however things definitely
have changed for the better lot can be
done in in sonj area which again it is a
male film which has only one female
protagonist to speak of which is what is
interesting is that it's it's her story
which is at the core of the film and
until that story gets resolved the story
doesn't get resolved right so so yes
actually this is the first time where I
have done a hero's journey heroes when I
say hero male hero's journey somewhere
even in your thigh it was nice character
or definitely in his candid scale but
this is the first time I've done a
hero's journey you know and the woman
actually plays the second lead in the
film right did you enjoy that sort of
that that change in in in approach in
tone if you like well this is a film
with a lot of testosterone it's
evidently from yeah yeah but but not all
just testosterone is good testosterone
also says that you know because in you
know in a world with a very macho world
you know world full of men and you know
dangerous men we discussed very very
tender ideas about you know sexuality
and we discuss gender and we discuss
discrimination it's it's it's about the
coos with existential issues actually do
you feel Abhishek like do you feel that
the Mito movement will have an impact on
the way that we portraits women in the
movies I sure hope so
I sure you know out and says that I'm
apologizing for Chikni Chameli you know
given given me - and given that we're
now examining the the male gaze do you
feel like that will have an impact I
mean definitely what really needs to go
out and if me to obscenity why not the
Chikni Chameli variety of you know
display I should just completely
completely be left out I mean you know
you can do an item number show men and
women dancing having fun that it's
simple you have a Kumari and all that
it's a very racy song but you have the
hero Aron dancing that's fine I mean
that's alright
but but that should she really go out I
also think that me too
because of the discourse around me to a
lot of the audience's that are going to
watch the movie in the theater actually
the multiplexes they are going to get
averse to this whole idea sure and
that's not gonna sell I mean I know that
I know a couple of filmmakers who had
those kind of songs in the film and then
excise them out of the film before it
released because time bedell yeah great
you know and and times are changing and
that sort of an item number should
definitely leave about having women
characters of of some meaning in the
film I I think that will truly start
happening rajeev when we stop looking at
characters when the writers and
directors create them as main characters
and woman guys just people if we certain
start looking at people and with all the
complexities and flaws and Watson all
right I think we're gonna be fine film
was such a big part of our own film
history makes them anymore well did they
died a natural death because I think we
there are no stories because to start
kind of stories we were telling one was
why does somebody become a duck so you
killed my father in my childhood mother
in my childhood so I became a doctor
take revenge okay ii was there is this
great doc ooh let's go catch him so you
have Meera go Meera they show you have
Shirley and you have Ganga Jamuna and
all of that and and and really and they
dealt with the feudal society that
exists in some indoors and you know yeah
chuckles and things like that now that
sort of ended you know in the 80s it
started getting over so so I think the
Bandit movie the Chandra kind of stipe
sort of died a natural death and we
didn't have any in the 90s the 90s gave
birth to the story of poolan devi within
pandit Queen and then followed 20 years
later almost in which were biopics
reciting djamil we hardly had any
jumbled movie right you know the only
friend that I can think of which was
about bandits which was shot in Chambal
although very little was decayed true so
so but what's on Syria is really it's
all of these films there is a bit of the
Indian bandit film of the 67 teens there
is definitely a lot of I mean bandit
will to the reference point for her the
American Western was the reference point
of me but in terms of its aesthetics and
style is a very current modern
contemporary thriller
you said that you were keen to make an
action film that explores their soul yes
what got you interested what was the
starting point for you I mean was it
love for foolin I mean was it love for
bandit I mean a Bandit Queen was it
something specific yeah I mean what
happened with yes deaf man Batman it was
a reference point like I said however
what we also did when we did a lot of
literature about say we all read
Mallesons book much more exhaustive
write about you've said that that and
and prashant pan chairs executives and
meeting all those people and meeting a
lot of what I could say retired bandits
and meeting a lot of these people we
what was very fascinating words who
these people are or at least what they
thought of themselves so here you are in
my from my urban lens I see you as a
criminal you you you rob people you
kidnap people and that's who you are
that's your identity but that's not what
they thought of themselves and that's
what's fascinating I'm a warrior I have
a Dharma I'm a very pious man these are
all beliefs you know Maggie Carter may
that was very very crazy for me this is
very good it's almost like you know it's
almost like the Italian mafia which has
its own set of rules in her so in that
sense it was very very fascinating for
me and we wanted to make a film about
that in the sense we searched the soul
is that you you are you are abandoned
you're living an extremely unforgiving
life I mean you you you're walking 50
kilometers a day you barely getting
anything to eat but why are you doing
all of this and world things of yours a
criminal who the cops are baying for
your blood why are you doing this Dharma
you know they have these principles I
have these duties are you saying that
you that they believe they had a higher
purpose exactly so now when those
beliefs come under when those beliefs
are threatened when when you start
questioning those beliefs how do you
live what do you do is what the film is
really about and in through that through
all of that we also discussed these very
social and political issues but that's
what essentially at the core yeah what
was fascinating about tumble about
shooting in interval I mean you've been
a fan of those films but I'm actually
going out there and sort of living
breathing in those you know for for for
60 days yeah that 60 days but we were
there for three months you know when you
go to jumble if you were ever get an
opportunity to visit
you'll be you'll be shocked that we
haven't made more films here because
visually it's one of the most arduous
arresting landscapes that you will see
because the jumble just visually I'm
talking about this formation of the
mounds in the chamber to be heard as
they call it that kind of geological
formation exists nowhere in the world so
it's unique to the world you know and
and and it's absolute and it's it's
almost lends itself to a story which has
so many layers because we put a camera
anywhere you see layer zero literally
you see so many layers you know ups and
downs in 50 feet mounted and but that's
beautiful is tois as it was it was
extremely excruciating you know I'm
trying to shoot a film there
logistically very very challenging and
know my crew must have suffered a lot
and given me a lot of galleys while you
make the film but but at the same time
when everybody decides they look look we
this this is as bad as this is going for
so might as well be happy while we're
trying to do it so it was actually one
of the more pleasant experiences of
making a film despite all the harsh
difficulties that we had writer Sudha
Sharma maintained a sort of document a
kind of Bible which which was the reckon
of for for everything that you went on
to do any any during your research any
anecdote any you know tell me about that
and how that sort of served is I mean
what was this and did it prove very
handy in in the final script yes yes yes
a lot of the a lot of the stories
actually little stories little character
details actually came from there
and I remember sue diamond Massoud
Sudeep and I were in his second trip in
my first trip when we'd gone to research
in Chambal
and we're sitting across this retired
gentleman who was a police officer spent
his entire life chasing haku's and we
would talk and he was talking he was
just talking as if he I decided I design
and then while he was talking just in
the ratings are narrating a small
incident it was just just completely out
of the blue gum in beaver is completely
shocked by what he was saying it was
absolutely such a window into the into
the soul of these people who these
people are what who do they think about
who they for example the story was they
said there was a shootout between
bandits in and the police and the police
managed to kill about 18 of them and
they were going on checking if these
anywhere anybody was still alive so that
they could get them
to the hospital or something and one guy
was nearly dying but still alive so is
this Cooley kiddo I said no no I'm gonna
go I just do one me one favor he said
take my mustache and toilet ups upwards
because it's my photograph come from the
newspaper but I don't want to look like
an idiot so you can understand what kind
of people these are you know and admit
it made its way into the film of course
and being so people looking at this is
gold man this is gold so there were
things like this is indeed stranger than
fiction yeah so it was things like these
I mean this is still an anecdote but
there are also little details right you
said costume details Jim details just a
manner of talking certain words you know
because we were also discovering and I
like the language so so all of that and
it was a pretty sick document which
which may most of it made its way into
the film did your actors have a tough
time for wrapping the tongues around
Boone Daley I mean dad Elias yeah yeah
some of them did not manoj because he is
he is working magnet queen so he still
knew it was fresh in his memory
neither did honor because he's nearly
from there a few hours away but and a
lot of the secondary cast were local a
lot of them weren't actually so they
they had to learn but booming so chance
Ranvir Shorey they had a very tough time
you know it's very close to him the aha
you know so it's almost it's almost our
you know if we just open our minds a
little bit open your ears you can easily
understand I mean jungle conga they say
Jaggu how go that's about all you know
but when you're speaking it as if it's
your second nature
you speak it all the time is familiar
yeah but I think Bumi and and we
completely mastered it I mean you know I
think there in fact started thinking
like that also
sushant took a little while but he was
completely fine by the NFL was there
ever a question from the producers but
you know house is going to play with
audiences I mean producers tend to ask
those questions all the time because
because nowhere we luckily for me run
Ronnie and his team has been very
enthusiastic about this film for sure it
doesn't have some of the more mainstream
or commercial elements
not all of them but it has some of them
right and by way of entertainment
I mean cinema is where we is getting
into entertainment by way of a story
right so in terms of that we were you
work very hard on this story yeah we
have what I have also done is it's an
action thriller wherein I have devised
several set pieces and and I've given
you a flavor of different kinds of
action so it's not just it's not as a
gun battle of the gun battle right so
I've given your stealth sequence I've
given you kidnap sequence I've given you
so I've given you various shades of an
action film right where you can enjoy
different kinds of deliver you're
entertaining yes and the video game you
know various levels so it's a bit like
that so there's a lot of entertainment
to be derived from things like that yeah
but entertainment means like a complete
Olly usually in our cinema yeah and I'm
more molecular like that I'm sure how do
you look back at what happened with the
Punjab in terms of the censorship the
the film leaked and and how did that
sort of determine how you wanted to
continue making movies just in terms of
censorship did that strengthen your
resolve to continue making the kind of
movies that you want and and and sort of
being a constant conflict with with the
censors if you like or does it break a
person fortunately for me did not change
the way I think my attitude towards my
own work did not change so much but it
did teach me a thing or two about how to
deal with this certification board more
than anything else this was a film that
I was making which was about bandits
their language is not the most you know
sweet to the years it's not exactly
parliamentary and I did not have a
choice in the matter how to lose there I
mean in fact I was shooting a scene one
of the characters in the film manages
character does not use abusive language
in fact he's very respectful
it's a gentleman Tocqueville knows so
you be shooting a scene when there was a
policeman standing there it says he
tapped my shoulder said they don't talk
like that I said yes sir I understand
because they don't yeah so the language
is there you know and some of the issues
are pretty it's it's got adult themes so
fortunately for me I did not have to
change that nothing in my mind changed
regarding that experience was terrible
but I think there are two problems here
is the what is the larger issue of the
larger debate around censorship and
frankly if you asked me to address this
issue with the with the professionals
who are working in the certification
boards either say the bureaucrats or
even the volunteers then it's pointless
because they are following a mandate the
government has told them to do something
and they're just following the mandate
there's no reason to discuss that with
them which is a larger debate it's up to
the lawmakers and up to us as
journalists as filmmakers to bring this
issue out in the open keep the debate
going on until something changes but the
other problem in Utah was the manner in
which the whole process was handled
mostly by the CBSE that was very very
problematic I said all right censorship
aside you can speak to me respectfully
you can be you know you can be open
about what we want me to do and we can
talk to each other be collaborative have
a dialogue have a dialogue and that was
missing because it was it was completely
peremptory key this is do it this way or
my way or the highway and that was
unacceptable to us so that's how that's
where it went on actually insolently I
have had no issues you know because
because it was a very collaborative very
polite very easy process for me and
although I still have issues with the
censorship you know and and concepts and
some just excisions that I had to make
in so Julia I alright with at least
process of it right what's the status on
on on issue care do you see that as a
franchise I know you had two stories to
tell but but you don't seem like you
don't seem like someone who's at this
little franchise will make no not really
not really in fact data-scale also
happened because bashar lancha maru the
ad right it feels like the thing that
produces yeah and I and I actually I
actually joined the film Isis fine I'll
do it but it was only a few months into
the script that I actually started
believing in the film and then I you
know went with all my heart
to make that film I think I think these
are wonderful characters khalujaan and
webmin and by and large world watch
Ishqiya the two films have done it has
talked about romance and sexuality and
all that these are wonderful things that
it spoke about after having Ruta having
made or science on Julia which are very
heavy films for me I would much rather
do a very light film next weather is to
be in
we are not entirely depends on the story
you know and I have completely run off
ran out of ideas as far as that is
concerned but if somebody comes to me
with an idea I absolutely take your of
course doing a digital series next how
do you see that medium as interesting
for someone like you who's you know
who's sort of cut his teeth on one
feature films and and a certain kind of
feature film yeah I think the most
fascinating thing about digital is the
freedom that it gives the writer and
filmmaker to explore plots and
characters I think that's one of the
best things about it and frankly I would
not have been saying this ten years ago
because the revolution that that we even
witness in front of us actually began 10
years ago actually began with the wire
but it's really been breaking bad in all
these things and 10 years ago I had no
idea about the structure and form of
this sort of a medium but I after having
consumed copious amounts of you know
series I understand you know now I'm
getting a sense of it you know and I
think I think it's it's it's the
differences I think film is a novel ah
you know it's about 100 hundred to 20
page thing and series well it's a novel
it's a lot of you have 400 pages to work
with and that gives you much more
freedom you know like subplots or sub
tracks in film are completely forbidden
there no no okay you can't do that
anymore but in that you can in this you
can thrive on it you can go on a subplot
explore something connected to the main
theme and it all ties in beautifully and
everybody is happy so this kind of a
freedom I think it's very liberating for
a filmmaker and I think beach beach may
you can just go out and do it and come
back to your you know main thing also at
the present moment there's the little
censorship
here's hoping that you will continue to
give us these sort of really
entertaining engineering not in the in
the way that we've come to associate the
word entertainment but but interesting
for provoking films not small thank you

unfolding in Karnataka is now reaching
some kind of a climax because this is
what is happening now latest is the JDS
MLAs are being approached by the Bajada
Giunta party that is what is being said
now by leaders of the junta dull secular
money is being offered to our emily's to
jump ship while methods on the fault
line
well joining us live payal what sir
what's the reality where is this
information coming from well this is
coming in from the JD s can be been able
to speak to a couple of Emily's hoopin
who are telling us that you know they've
been getting calls from the BJP offering
them money money to the tune of about 50
crore saying that you know that's the
kind of money that we can give you what
you need to do is jump ship and come
over to the BJP so clearly this is not
going to end anywhere soon you know
Italy seems like and what kind of money
what kind of money is on the table worth
50 crores is what is being said 250
crores for one MLA yes that's that's
precisely the point so you are these
guys are speaking and telling us
although they have not expressed express
their intent in the sense they're not
clarified whether or not they're
considering this particular offer but
they've been getting calls is what
they've been saying and this doesn't
look like it's going to end anywhere
time around you know because you've had
Shobha Khurana Jane yeah drop amongst
the others so you know speaking about
the kind of role they're HD Kumaraswamy
and the Congress had been playing trying
to poach their people in fact you know
Shobha Carnage's go ahead and name the M
it has also been approached by the
juries and the Congress combined so so
what a pile you're saying that the JDS
is saying that the BJP is offering them
50 crores but the BJP is saying and
Shobha chroniger was was tweeting a
short while back that it's a genius
Congress combined which is approaching
the BJP MLAs yes now what is a going
rate there can you tell us that also
well they haven't spelled out the money
because you know the Congress and the JD
is for the longest had been saying that
the money's with the BJP we don't have
the money we can only and probably you
know yeah when yeah the robber yesterday
was speaking to us when he said that the
Benari MP rather the Bellary ma was
approached by JD as he was called by SD
Kumaraswamy offered a ministerial berth
even that's a little difficult because
you know in the existing coalition their
own people you know whether or how
they're going to figure them out and how
they're probably going to accommodate is
something which is I've been a question
and the second expand rights of an MLA
according to pile is 50 crores today
that's the price of our democracy pile
thanks for joining us so for that quick
update he
you were a Karnataka MLA all you had to
do was to think in terms of switching
sites every year and every year every
time you switch sites look at the price
it keeps going up so by the time you hit
the five-year mark for all you know you
got to 150 crores in the bag is that the
ugly reality of coalition politics is
that the ugly reality of politics in our
country gut abundant collapsing in
Karnataka and a mahogany ndon which has
just come into existence in Uttar
Pradesh is now already giving us some
signals of what is it tragically ahead
and why the road ahead is going to be
very very difficult Maya Bertie the
former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh
whose turn 63 today so happy birthday to
the BSP boss on her 63rd birthday
posters have come out across multiple
dish asking that been my with eg now be
positioned as the prime ministerial
candidate for 2019 my body was just
sealed our alliance with the kill each

single Lok Sabha MP despite having 20%
vote she's been a chief minister on
three occasions earlier in Uttar Pradesh
now Miami team because she's an alliance
with achalasia Adam believes that she is
the person who could very well end up
launching the biggest battle against
Prime Minister Modi
how was she intended to do that just

cyclical so let's take that question
straight away Benji call pradhan mantri
banaji
can benji really become the danman 3 can
my have to become pradhan mantri
let's look at the numbers and let's try
and answer that question for you what
has been my letís best performance mile
DS best performance was in was with 21
looks of our seats she did not get those
21 looks of our seats even when she was
chief minister of Uttar Pradesh with a
full majority government what she cannot
afford to do right now is it she can't
afford to lose more than five out of the
38 seats in yupi and why do I say 538
seats because my ethey is contesting on
38 seats each with a kill each other
if she gets in excess of 30 seats then
she will be one person who could perhaps
end up being more than potentially month
I managed in West Bengal and perhaps the
DMK / a AIADMK in the state of Tamil
Nadu barring these two regional players
the possibility of any other regional
player crossing that mark of 30 is very
low the BJP may touch 30 or upwards
let's say in bigger states Maharashtra
or the Congress party may Congress NCP
combined but single individual leaders
other than my ot only month of energy
and possibly d MK / a AIADMK my wa t
ideally would like to win seats in
states other than Uttar Pradesh as well
she got into an alliance with the geogi
in Chhattisgarh didn't manage to make an
him didn't manage to make a let's say
decisive impact there but she would like
it if she can get into an alliance with
iron LD say in Haryana but the G joking
shut is good if she can carve out maybe
two to three seats more in states other
than doctor Pradesh then she would
really be thinking she would really be
hedging her bets and thinking rusted to
Delhi is not that far up the leaking a
duty do name she must she must get more
seats than mum time energy then Sharad
Pawar NK Stalin and Aquila shadow
she's contesting on equal number of see
- they kill each other but she needs to
ensure because she sits on a
disproportionately higher word share
than any other party in the entire
country while other parties certainly in
the state of U P start at zero Maya thei
on an average in each constituency
starts at 70,000 because that's the big
that population of Jadhav or the Dalit
vote which is a core support base for my
a--they all she needs to do is to add on
to that vote base add on to that support
base with support of the OBC community
the Yaniv community which may come from
Akhilesh Yadav who are the people who
are competing with her and that's a real
story look at what's happened today mum
dad Banerjee is throwing a grand rally
grand big opposition anti-bjp party is
being organised on the 19th in west
bengal and what's going on my what he
says I will not go Mamta Banerjee says I
have now extended invites to every
opposition leader well it's up to the
opposition leaders so battle number one
is between
mamta and my a--they batter number 2
Rahul Gandhi Rahul Gandhi has already
been endorsed as Prime Minister
candidate bye-bye I am Chris Allen from
the DMK will he back my a--they there is
a question mark
Sharapova at the age of 78 Sharad Pawar
knows that this could be his last hurrah
his last sort of battle point last blast
blasts war cry Sharad Pawar may well
think in terms of supporting Marathi if
my body is in that region of 35-plus and
who knows who knows maybe Sharad Pawar
meeting why don't we get into a 50/50
kind of an arrangement primary student
contender Rahul Gandhi himself my what
he says Congress party is a stir up as a
pathogen the body why would all Gandhi
think in terms of supporting Marathi for
prime ministership there is a big
question mark on that bottom line is
this my worthy to be the Prime Minister
of India at this stage looking a very
very remote possibility the more she
talks about the prime ministerial
ambitions the more that argument between
must boot Sircar and merge boots or car
will end up being made by Prime Minister
Modi that's it then from me road to 2019
is only getting hotter and bigger we'll
keep you updated on that road to 2019

Congress party legging it sacrilege
yeah Layton is door on Dallas Abby
watching before Muslim logo castle the
castle comedy night Osaka
the PSP played a big spoiler there will
be SP took substantial number of walls
let's compare this to the previous
election the word share is gone down
they've just come with two seats it is a
BSP chief Maya with his birthday today
and after the snap to the Congress in
yuffie alliance talked she was unscathed
in her attack she did not spray the
congress in her Bob's talking about the
Poe force and the Rafael deal in the
same breath also criticizing the farmer
loan via policies in the newly formed
Congress governs in all three states
congress also has not been kind to the
BSP in its attack with the parties
multiple days she finished her common
loss even saying that BSP now only gets
antique candidate votes unlike before
and it also played spoiler for the
Congress in multiplication well is the
sort of uncertainty that is dangling on
the Congress government's head in
motherfu dish upsetting it can the
Congress even trust in a lie like my
avati what does this on-and-off ally of
BSP mean for the larger scheme of things
vis a vie a pan India anti-bjp coalition
well that's a big talking point this
evening on election epicenter I'm saying
Amal tanning first stop this
conversation CNN news a teens V song we
had with multiple days Chief Minister
come a lot listening congratulations on
winning the election were you surprised
no I wasn't surprised over the last two
months I was certain we would win and
the question was the margin I was
disappointed in fact we didn't even
improve one last time why well I think
the the PSP played a big spoiler there
will be SP took substantial number of
votes and I think we got our strategy
wrong in social mechanisms of the
candidate people apt so that's really
what happened
so as you if you'd had that BSP alliance
with things would be different
know why because in certain areas in the
end we got to look at the sum total of
things if we had a BSP Alliance we would
have lost we would again I think we were
lost more yes more lost more what
happened to the BSP result they would
share has gone down
let's compare this to the previous
election the word share has gone down
they've just come with two seats no but
they did play a spoiler they did play a
spoiler in certain seats I think that
the words which the BSP gets is now anti
candidate votes is not previously it
used to be what the BSP gets on its own
now the anti candidate vote the anti
Congress candidate vote yeah I won't say
it's anti congressman antique Congress
candidate what who doesn't want the BJP
goes and votes for the BSP an
alternative so what you think is quite
significant you're saying that far from
being the great social force among the
let's that it is portrayed in the media
the BSP is actually a way of people
registering a protest against the
Congress absolutely an outlet it becomes
an outlet to voters to choose somebody
else and that emerges from if the
candidate they want to vote against okay
or the candidates caste they want to
vote against that is what happens all

cuz a good politics at our fire boil
kinetic idea okay include the Qaeda
rocket Bojan so much partita both of
ocean so much politics et in the
kilowatt region tough what is the name
you never liked about you so much party
say okay vanilla here and above chuck
amato said Sanjay Jha hey Congress skip
Travolta Sanjaya how do you respond to
what and above Chuck is saying I mean
are you getting arrogant he's that's
what he seems to be suggesting at the
end of the day you were able to form the
government in mp with the support of the
Biogen samajwadi party so why the
statement from Camelot then well you
know the truth is that we have a lot of
respect for my abou T G and mister
Akhilesh Yadav
they have supported us in States there
have been part of the UPA one and you
pay - I want to make the critical point
here that every state has got his own
unique dimensions for example if you
look at mother Pradesh Chhattisgarh
Rajasthan I mean it was a decision taken
by the party we felt that the BJP could
have been more comprehensively defeated
if the parties went on their own I do
believe that where the BSP is concerned
or the Samajwadi Party is concerned they
have a similar ideological platform as
the Congress party has at the same time
mr. come Bernard is a very seasoned
political
shall we say experience terror leader
and you know when he says to a question
asked to him by weed that you know how
do you look at the you know what the
Alliance could have done if we had one
with BSP and
mysticum anarthas answered that very
explicitly okay that sometimes an
alliance work so sometimes it can become
counterproductive but having said that
let me tell you that we are very very
bullish on our side that we tried for a
mahogany Luther Pradesh model the three
state elections are now part of history
we have got to look at the elections it
looks about 2019 but I don't know why
it's a PHP and the Samajwadi have okay
it's the Congress really a reason why
the snap today from this sort of a
statement from common laws what no no I
don't think you should see any any
linkage between the two at all
I think mr. Gandhi perhaps answered it
eloquently when he said that I respect
the Alliance brought together by
Samajwadi Party and the BSP the
Communist Party by the way I can tell
you from a lot of very serious ground
reports emerging is looking at this is a
an extraordinary opportunity to
establish the footprint back all over
all over again and Luther Pradesh okay
we believe it would be a win win because
we see a lot of synchronicity between
the Samajwadi Party and the and the BSP
and the Congress party even post poll
okay so the piece of BJP that should be
worried because we all believe it's a
BJP under Narendra Modi who was
destroying democracy has disrupted the
economy created a farmer distress
situation you know but what's a pity at
the point in time all of that does
happen I mean myath he went on to
criticize the Congress party today she's
she's been critical of the party and let
me bring in analyzing of the BJP here an
illness saying this is what the BJP is
being saying see we said so this is a
negative sort of an alliance based on a
negative agenda which is anti Modi
anti-bjp agenda they have nothing of
their own they don't see eye to eye
perhaps sanchita this is only giving
more you know lending more credence to
that with that that that sort of you
know observation of the BJP analyst
saying you want to say anything about
what's really happened visibly my with
his statement today I like analyzing
first spokesperson of the BJP so hard
Mia how hearts in ginger he might be
trying to sound very resonate but we
very well know
that the Alliance which has which has
come up in Uttar Pradesh or the help
which Congress has taken in Madhya
Pradesh or in Rajasthan we very well
know that this is the alliance of
convenience during the days of raja
maharaja and batches it year they used
to be marriages of convenience so here
it is the alliance of convenience
because we very well know that in 2019
sorry in 2017 Samajwadi Party and
Congress were together in utter Pradesh
and they were singing together
Uttar Pradesh co-led Coca Donald a coca
South present there but the people of
the police denied them now we talked
about Madhya Pradesh we very well know
that Congress did not come in majority
and the Congress had to take help of
Samajwadi Party and the BSP and as soon
as the BSP gave support to Congress in
Madhya Pradesh she arm twisted Kamala
Chi
I'm twisted common logy and she
threatened that either you take back all
the cases on put on my workers or I will
walk out and homology had to kneel down
in front of her but at the same time I
need to ask BSP VSP Supreme or the
leaders that we very well know that
kamila the what Kamala ji said about the
people from coming from Uttar Pradesh
and Bihar and working in Madhya Pradesh
like he was so critical about them and
BSP supremo coming from Uttar Pradesh
then also she supported Congress like
she has to answer okay even ecclesiology
has to answer in Uttar Pradesh and as
well as in Madhya Pradesh as well as far
as party gingka party is concerned as I
have said earlier also not on your show
but in other shows as well that we have
got a report card with writing numbers
but the report cards with the VSP SP or
the Congress if we talk about you P or
if we call talk about our own country
India or all the all the marks they have
they have is underlined by red okay they
have to alter the country okay they have
to bring it Sanjaya then I have to go to
New Jersey as well as and above chalk
who continues to be with us but quick
response from Sanjay Jane before I move
on to the other case
thank you very much now let me tell you
that the BJP instead of trying to
criticize the Congress must get his own
house in order
sixteen of their principal allies have
already deserted them you looks at the
AGP in Assam and and even in charcoal
the the Shiv Sena by the way who is
still their alliance partner in
Maharashtra mr. Thackeray actually said
that mr. Rahul Gandhi's bang on target
when he calls the Prime Minister Chaka
thought your hair on the Rafael scam now
the bottom line is very straightforward
if any party has done an opportunistic
alliance it was the PDP and the BJP
alliance in Jammu and Kashmir now as far
as the rest of us are concerned I'd be
very frank with you we are going to be
fighting alone in uttar pradesh and we
will be competing with with the
Samajwadi Party BSP combined as well as
the BJP and the Communist Party believes
like we won 22 seats in 2009 elections
we have a great chance to galvanize
their workers and we will battle really
hard to try and win as many as we can
and still despite that we believe that
there is a great potential for Samajwadi
Party BSP to do well and I think between
the two of us even the way of fighting
separately the BJP will probably get
obliterated in ruther pradesh and may
not even get 5 to 8 I think we should
see the writing on the wall irrespective
of the coalition's that are happening
okay ninjetta three doesn't that also
really bring out the inherent
contradictions of this market but then
you know I mean you're fighting each
other in a state like you peed so three
Carnot contests now in you pee but with
the support of the BSP the Congress is
in power in math if Rajesh I mean this
is what these are the inherent
contradictions of the market but then I
these are going to be like problems that
are not going to die down anytime soon
isn't it I think you know it's very
surprising
mr. Camelot's words about the BSP even
suppose hypothetically it was true you
are looking at an alliance with these
parties if not pre-poll then poses all
yes why needle them that is why it was
inexplicable when the BSP SP of heard
that support to his government even
before they got around
asking for it unconditionally and I
believe that they had promised
ministership say to samajwadi party and
probably to be a speed and it could have
been given again to buy goodwill by is
mr. Kemal not equating BSP with nota do
say that only people who don't want to
vote for the Congress and the BJP
they're in to register their protest
will press that button of BSP in other
words it can be not also now had that
been the case in Uttar Pradesh mr.
Akhilesh Yadav would not have hitched
his wagon to that of myopathy and my
what is right when she says that
alliance is likely to give sleepless
nights to BJP they're already worried
about it but I don't understand the
Congress party are they just simply
reacting to what they call you know a
fait accompli presented by the SP nbsp
method per day is not taking them on
board they say the birth the Congress
after these three straight victories was
asking for 20 seats whereas that is very
unreasonable they were prepared to give
it it they could have been you know give
and take and let's remember even though
the Sun is high is very optimistic and
certainly the Congress is on a revival
part let's make no mistake about that
how many seats is going to get in doctor
pradesh is a different story yes but the
Alliance had it been SP BSP rld Congress
will give a very different feel and
impact all over the country not just in
with the footage it has a national
impact it said it has a ripple effect in
other states so not having it even
though I think it's a huge setback to
the BJP not having it is also
unfortunate okay okay all right Sanjay
I'd like to respond to that well you
know I I would like to just tell the new
judge you have the highest respect for
her I don't think at any point of time
is anybody dismissing the BSP and mother
position at all in fact mr. karmanov has
said in the interview that the BSP was a
spoiler which means that the base we had
a significant tactical political impact
so I don't
respect of the bsp is being diminished I
think the reality is that yes there was
no agreement in terms of which seats
should we fight for I think we have said
it before Neha that the you know it is a
tough job you know for parties all
parties are very bullish all parties
want to back their candidates and there
are times you disagree and you know
that's what happened so I don't think
there's any bad blood of bitterness at
all you know but these things don't go
well when you're talking about an anti
BJP pan India sort of an alliance and
I'm going to bring in a noob of charcoal

Manila Singh yeah I just want to make
two points here okay number one when we
talk about common logic common lagi
commenting on a Maya Bhatia is behavior
or I can say on BSP party there is an
element of truth in that
there is absolutely no doubts that the
what percentage of vsp reduced in Madhya
Pradesh and even where BSP lost two
seats there okay so this shows that the
popularity graph of BSP it went down in
Madhya Pradesh and I am pretty sure that
it is going to reflect in Uttar Pradesh
as well so just by a two big political
parties in Uttar Pradesh coming together
and trying to create a perception by
different you know unless we're running
out of time
they are you keep saying you know the
BJP keeps saying that this is an
opportunistic alliance negative agenda
but what the BSP here is saying that
what did you doing then Jammu and
Kashmir I mean what sort of a common
agenda did you have with the PDP that
you're going to get onto that also here
yeah yes I will answer that Sneha that
yeah it was not pre-poll alliance and
when the when we came into when when we
came together to form the government
okay partridge in the party realized
that a PDP is not the right party who
can do work for Jammu and Kashmir we
worked out alright so we are not into
the game of Alliance for our own
convenience we are here to work for the
country right that is the basic location
between these regional parties and
nesting Sanjay Jha nija Chaudhary and
above Chuck I'm going to quickly thank
all of you for sharing upon to view with
us we are running completely out of time

I was totally unaware you put the donkey
you all look on me equal
I believe oval folks not the fact that
I'm still married that's also
unbelievable for the first time in 71
years of Test cricket well played India
you know what upset the Aussie is more
than sledging was this it's a very
dangerous dance if you're doing it make
sure you're wearing underwear all right
there's no hand movement whatsoever in
this dance oh it's also called the taco
dance from Seoul a reference outdated a
wild ignore and move on it was
choreographed by Rishabh month who is
completely underaged for dancing
fabulously to keep a batsman
by the way the Aussie teams soft no
slashing approach backfired so after
losing the series 2-1 to India the
Aussie star is sledging again and by
Aussies I don't mean the players I mean
the Aussie public was slashing their own
players it's almost like Australia and
India exchanged personalities India has
the aggression and the sledging Aussies
were quiet and after the series the
Indian team celebrated all night not the
Aussies the garmiskar border trophy was
given away only by border as the Aussies
forgot to call gawa scre Aziz behaving
like us both the coaches praised the
same team India again used to behave
after winning a series finally at the
start of the series Kohli was calling
Ravichandran Ashwin Ashwin boy but after
the Sydney Test and his five-wicket haul
it was Ashwin made down good care down
there yeah oh that's because he never
stolen our spin spot in the team omo
cricket bcc i--'s issued show-cause
notices to hardik Pandya and kill Rahul
for their comments on sex and women on
the current Johar show shouldn't they
have been issued show-cause notices much
earlier for something worse their
hairstyles fashion statements this
I'm a fine one to talk lots more coming
up but first here are the headlights 10%
corner for general category poor upper
caste clears Parliament now said to be a
law chips in and VIPs alliance in
trouble will other be linked with
driving license and I spoke to Autobahn
care on his latest film our top story in
a masterstroke though I prefer visa I'm
not coming I don't plug unless they pay
money we don't plug and a masterstroke
ahead of the general elections and what
may prove to be a game-changer the Modi
government this week approved 10 percent
reservation in all jobs and education
for the economically backward upper
caste
now while this seems like a good idea
let's try and understand what this means
in reality joining us now is alleged
former economic adviser and deputy
director of the National Commission of
social justice we have the department
and empowerment we also have that
department and this gentleman says his
caste is unknown but for a certain
amount of money he'll convert to any
cost
sir so what is your annual income what
why must I am only trying to ascertain
whether you are economically backward or
not although by the looks of it you
don't seem economically backward at all
maybe intellectually backward the thing
about being all that before you think
you can scare me but how do you
determine who is economically backward
and who is not I mean what is the
definition of economically weak can you
tell us now that is a good question as
provided under this proposed amendment
if your total income of your household
which includes the income of your
parents is below rupees 8 lakh per annum
then you are deemed economically weak
below eight legs economically big I see
go on go on which means let's say your
wife's income is 2 lakhs a year your
father's income is also 2 lakhs a year
and your income is a little more 4 lakhs
a year which is 8 lakhs you are not
eligible in case you wish to become
eligible for this 10 percent quota you
will either have to throw your wife or
your father out of the house while our
father this is not
joints what about both go on please go
on what are the criteria the other
criteria to ascertain whether you are
from the economically backward class and
are indeed entitled to 10% reservation
is if you own a residential plot
measuring less than a hundred yards or a
house that is smaller than a thousand
square foot Wow less than a thousand
square feet by that logic sir whatever
income may be 99 percent of people
living in Mumbai can be termed
economically weak not only that do you
know which segment of Indian society
meets all requirements for the 10
percent reservation quota no please tell
me who which segment of Indian society
has an income of below 8 lakhs per annum
also owns the residential plot measuring
less than a hundred yards or a house
that is smaller than thousand square
feet all own agricultural land below 5
acres and who can be officially called
economically weak are they stop showing
off my budget sallahu 98 percent of all
Indians 98 percent of all Indians I
don't know why I'm smiling that's not a
good thing but even if this had to work
how will you know who owns more and who
wants less I mean is there a process is
there an algorithm a mechanism a system
income tax income tax yes we will know
what you earn based on whether you file
income tax returns or not which slab you
come under or whether you pay income tax
at all I see I see so if you do not pay
income tax you are economically weak
okay which means that Vijay Mallya may
hold talks with neither Modi and all
black marketeers will be hereafter
deemed as economically we are people who
have homes in London bank accounts in
Switzerland travel the world and have
houses everywhere and never returned to
India like Sri coral regional director
of the show
we like to tell the truth comedies about
the truth we put the truth on the table
and we let you lap it up thinking of
lapping it up the Shiv Sena and the BJP
is nearly 30 year old Alliance in
Maharashtra seems to be on a very thin
ground it's a bit like the roads in
Mumbai where the holes keep happening
the doctor don't know with both allies
hurling the choices of abuses this is
true at each other they've been calling
each other names it all started when BJP
president Amit Shah in a speech said
that he would trash I quote thrashed
urschel's in our in the coming Lok Sabha
polls in response up in arms and
prepared for war see me as shoes in a
leader Ram Dass Kadam said I will bury
little bit marry the BJP in Maharaja
nice very right ready sounds like a rock
group let's just think about this for a
second
rash and berry didn't we stop using
those words of any boy in what 3rd grade
unless you're killed Rahul and hardik
Pandya mafia mango mafia mango dose I'll
say mafia mango why I didn't click it as
bathing Lagasse's let's move back to the
story joining us now is a Ledge
spokesperson for the Shiv Sena Ramnath
Karim well I don't know if he's run
after them but he is something - and put
TD Cometh
they took God God a big you know why I'm
smiling I'm smiling because that guy
looks like he deserves to be beaten
it is also be beaten and hey why are you
bearing I'm listening to all your talk
and who are you bearing in the mud is
that some BJP fellow you are bearing in
the mud just be clear about that huh w
because I have male Assam that BJ
because Nam daily the car let's go for
the BJP in the Shiv Sena ah what do you
want to know the BJP in the Shiv Sena
don't seem to be getting along for yours
actually and at the moment there seems
to be a lot of acrimony well it is that
carry money
like money there is no acrimony no no no
no no no there is a lot of acrimony no
actually money
the problem is with BJP they want
everything for free
what meaning all right they are not
willing to pay any money
how will they agree to pay actually
money hey I'm not understanding I mean
there seems to be a lot of malice
mulisch what do they think they are IV
refused all knowledge they want manage
all the time they want to manage their
egos because we are the shoe Sena we
will not give my leash and anything to
their egos not my leash I'm trying to
say the word malice are they same to
same thing you know it's not it's not
the same thing I was speaking of malice
and by Mellon's I meant it seems there's
a lot of bad blood bad blood bad blood
that bad blood our blood is not bad
their blood must be bad yeah highest
quality of that are we are cut Raja
Maharaja blood ah that is what is
running you like going to my wife you
know nothing is making any sense you
still don't get my point I'm asking you
a very simple question baba ji why is
there so much antipathy between the two
parties anybody what is this anybody you
asked me about homeopathy natural I will
tell you what is this antipathy Timothy
I was just showing off but obviously you
don't understand when you answer the
English language I got 82 percent in
sins evils college in 1994 will you

and I'll ask you a very simple question
I'll put it very simply what is the
problem between the Shiv Sena and the
BJP no come on now that is a simple
question ah yes yes an answer it the
problem is the shoe sena is the better
party than the BJP you can't just do
labels later how can you say that what
is the reasoning I will tell you who is
the leader of Shiv Sena tell me oh the
late Ballas I'm sorry who is the leader
of BJP under in Ramadi then how can he

nawazuddin siddiqui yeah and Narendra
Modi is played by Vivek Oberoi who is oh
that's an interesting why didn't they
rope in Shahrukh Khan what is the I mean
what is the problem
so many actors available for the role of
the prime minister Shahrukh Salman could
also do it and worst case scenario what
about me I would do I can the nuances of
the language we take a big then will
come back huh I will now speak only in

no diplomat the other card still remains
as controversial as ever if you remember
in September the Supreme Court limited
the use of other card this week Lok
Sabha passed a bill to try and
circumvent some of the Supreme Court
restrictions also Union Minister for
information technology Ravi Shankar
Prasad personal friend announced that
the government would soon make it
mandatory for linking other with driving
licences so to keep both in your hands
while driving where else do you think
the other caught me the commendatory
let's talk to an alleged spokesperson of
well from somewhere joining us now is
this from somewhere late spokesperson of
a Ravi Shankar Prasad Sri Ravi Shankar
Prakash sir
India is a technology giant we have 100
billion mobile phones in India we have
900 billion Internet connections in
India we have over 100 million credit
cards in India we have 90 million other
cards in India and do you know which
cards we have the most in India which
cards waiting cards
5000 billion cards
there's a 1,000 billion for one wedding
alone we want to talk about the other
card so we see previously it was
compulsively mandatory to voluntarily
get yourself and as our card the way you
put it
I am completely confused now it is no
longer like that it is voluntarily
compulsively to mandatorily get another
card and now they say and even more
confused don't be confused we will talk
about other card but before that let me
ask you a question all right go ahead
how can you prove that Ravi Shankar
Prasad is a union minister in India ah
good question how by asking for his on
our card yes yes good good good really
every morning Modi ji asks for his other
guard and only then he says talk to him
with mine but he doesn't ask anybody
else the other concerns gentlemen for
the record okay go on go on now show me
yours
what Oh when you said show me yours is
the caught me off guard therefore I
don't have I don't have it yet you don't
know how long our cards and how do I
know you are Cyrus brucha you could be
an imposter you could be Burke Haddad
it's very similar but she has much less
experience in the news format so I would
not like to brag but please go on so now
we have decided to link the other card
to your driving licence how is that
going to help you can go to a town in
Mumbai for example pay 2,000 rupees and
get a driving license that is exactly
why the other card is going to be linked
to the driving licence please explain so
that you will never ever have to go to a
tout pay 2,000 rupees and get a driving
licence wow that's good you've changed
the system that's good
never now you will have to go to a tout
pay 4000 rupees and get a driving
license and other card 4000 rupees we
are going to soon link the other card to
everything like like what else like air
tickets train tickets
tickets even cinema tickets even cinema
tickets so what's the point
have you seen the film Simba of course
not
in the film Simba how do you know which
actor is Singham and which actor is
Simba because one is Ajay Devgan and the
other reason we sing though because both
will have to show their other cards

you been on tinder tinder while you
notice something the dating and sex are
you talking about
we have decided to make tinder sex safe
how by making other compulsory on tinder
yes
no longer will you use rubber you will
now use plastic that's going a bit far
really not at all in fact we are going
to link up at our card to voting as well
you can fold through other cast your
vote how's that even possible only so
far we are having some technical
difficulties
what is this technical difficulty up to
now we've managed to put only one voting
option on the other card

the other card for voting the Lotus
option
how many politicians famous celebrities
etc have you noticed on Kindle could you

looks of my elections and it appears
that the central government now has
completely gone into six hitting mode to
try and influence various sections of
the electorate this is the latest that
we're picking up the center is mulling
an increase in the tax exemption limit
from two and a half lakhs per annum
which is presently the case to five lakh
rupees per annum centre not likely to
make indirect tax policy changes in vote
on account government is also not like
to cut corporate tax rate for the
remaining one percent corporate tax
payers announcement likely to be made in
the vote on account that brings us to
our second big question first we saw the
10 percent general class Kota now income
tax limit being hiked to 5 lakhs can the
middle class still be a loyal support
base for the Bart agenda party Amit
Maria what's going on for four and a
half years no such move by the BJP now
three months to go one after the other
bonanza for the middle class
are you worried no pain first of all I
think what you have just put out is in
the realms of speculation and as a
member of the ruling party I would not
like to comment on it but on your more
genetic question whether the BJP is
doing all that it is doing for the
middle class now I think that's a very
misplaced assessment because the
government has ensured that from the day
it came into office it has been working
to improve lives of people a very small
example just today the inflation index
for December 2018 has gone down further
which makes your vegetables your petrol
prices your dolls and your lentils and
everything else much cheaper we have not
yet forgotten the people who are buying
doll at the rate of 200 rupees per kilo
under UPA right now it is 6070 rupees
and nobody is even talking about it
whether it's airports it's roads this
passport save arcane rates efficient
delivery of services life is cheap not
sure that the entire day so you're
saying life is cheap permitted so you're
saying life is cheaper is is easier -
cheaper and the inflation is much lower
and
being done for the middle class even on
personal taxation you forget that along
with the exemptions the limit is
actually three and a half lakh rupees
the lower tax lab has been brought down
to five percent no world
the lower slab is that that rate is done
by mr. Modi's government why don't you
just make size but how did he just a few
weeks back we saw petrol and diesel
prices were at an all-time high we were
seeing how we're seeing how the gray my
paying classes were very very upset
because the builders were not delivering
the houses that they had invested in now
those right hands of sorts which is
being promised by the barrage at the
party do you believe it has enough meat
to influence people to stay with the BJP
if they would have voted for the BJP in
2014 no I I think you know this move
would only have marginal effect on the
voters because the real problem that the
economy is faced is that two shocks came
in the form of D monetization and GST
and that has impacted the unorganized
sector and that is ninety-three percent
of the entire workforce now they are not
going to be part of this tax concession
so only the middle class so they can
attract a little bit of the middle class
but what to do about the unorganized
sector which consists of the farmer the
youth and the what if I was to argue
what if I was to argue I don't need that
eeep in particular with malware as a
spokesperson so he won't officially put
a stamp on it but we've got this
confirmed from the topmost source in the
government that income tax limit is
going to be hiked exemption in income
tax is going to be heid from two and a
half lakhs to 5 lakhs now that to my
mind Arun G is a huge step five lakhs
per annum basically means people who are
earning 40,000 rupees 40 to 42 thousand
rupees across right urban India that
would be a huge population whether it's
first-time voters or it's people who may
have been working in banks or anywhere
else say for the last say five to seven
years that section is that is that is
that section clearly on the radar of the
BJP we have to put the figures in
perspective you know the income
taxpayers in the country are effectively
only about 20 million P
out of 1.3 billion so even though the
tax filers you know maybe about 67
million the effective tax payers of the
middle class is only about 20 million so
in a sense what you'll do is that 67
million figure would come down by about
20 to 30 million because those are
people who either file a return which is
a zero return or a very low return you
know so so in a sense you'd be affecting
about 20 to 25 million people you know
by this move but the problem is that we
you know we need a lot of expenditures
for the coming budget and we have
already cut GST and the fiscal deficit
is running very high so unless you get
money from the Reserve Bank of India and
you and if you give this kind of tax
concession then your fiscal deficit will
rise very much so I mean that will then
you on one hand for the on one hand
Wester one hand on it and for that is
good is that there is this bonanza which
is coming for the middle classes but on
the other we're also getting to hear
that the RBI has already cautioned the
government that these mudra loans which
I worked out these mudra loans may well
end up creating a huge NPA problem for
you so I ask you
ultimately at the end of four and a half
years are you also in the same mode as
any government that you must offer some
lollipops you must offer something or
the other which will immediately
influence the mind in the water you
don't have a report card of yours for
the last four and half years is only
giving lollipops to people is that the
reality number that I spoke about let me
remind him that India today is amongst
the top five performing economies in the
world and that really puts its physical
discipline out there for everybody to
judge you can be critical about
something but you can't be obviously
oblivious to the reality that's very
very important coming to what you call a
shock you know I just generally think
that this government has done a lot to
formalize the economy after the
formalization as a result of D
monetization in GST and
utilization that happened the tax base
has swelled to obtain about 700 people
and therefore a lot of people who were
earlier in the unorganized sector have
now moved into a formal organized sector
and don't forget even those in the
unorganized sector do pay their taxes do
file returns now you got to see how do
you increase the consumption in the
economy and if consumption in the
economy is going to increase by reducing
your indirect taxes and by increasing
the slab of your direct taxes you have a
recipe where more people I'll tell you
what if when you're a farmer what so
either you're right fair enough either
either if you're a farmer or you're
someone who's living in the cities
earning up to forty thousand rupees a
month narendra modi's certainly is going
to be the Santa cross for you this
election season let's see what else can
come out from the Bottari of finance
minister arun jaitley I met Bobby we are
one come on thank you so much for
joining us on our second big debate on
viewpoint tonight election times are
always the best times for citizens
because ultimately it's during that time
you have enough pressure with you to
ensure that you can get something more
out of the government is the government
now going to bless us but something else
is the government to give us more
freebies let's see let's see whether
that is the road that's the future on

news for the BJP suffered a slim
spokesperson of the BJP priyanka trivedi
congress spokesperson and shelter the
unseen a journalist and well-known
political commentator joining us on this
debate thanks for your time you want to
begin by asking Zephyr Aslam Rahul
Gandhi is repeating the Rafael jibe in
fact Rafael allegation and repeating the
chalkida arch or a jibe time and again
and this certainly is going to be the
narrative that the Congress is going to
look at and - till the time the
elections are round the corner obviously
is this something that's going to bother
the BJP the Congress obviously is
leaving this issue alive keeping this
issue alive say first of all it is the
absolutely best list to make this kind
of false allegation and a statement by a
mr. Rahul Gandhi that he was a CBI chief
earlier chief was wanted to fire any
fire who he doesn't have the right to
file in a fire against the Prime
Minister first of all mr. Rahul Gandhi
should know secondly it is absolutely
business the fact that the entire
process has been followed when he has
been sent to has been transferred to
another Department where and the entire
process has been followed he has been
given the opportunity so all the other
allegation he has made is absolutely
baseless second thing which I want to
highlight that mr. Rahul Gandhi month is
transfect himself he is out on bail
his mother is out on bail on what
charges corruption charges
they are the corrupt people we have seen
the government of fraud and protesters
during UPA one and UPA - what is he
talking about this is the corrupt free
government there is absolutely no
corruption last four and a half years we
have delivered to people's to their
expectation and importantly more
importantly what the Honorable Prime
Minister on day one had said that we
will ensure that the the marginalized
section of the society the poorer
section of the society
the less privileged people from our
community of all the communities will be
there if their interest will be
safeguarded and that is what the
Honorable Prime Minister means and in
last four and half years see every
single scheme has been directed towards
were have you ever heard and this has
been endorsed by people across the globe
Justin yogena this is the financial
inclusiveness a scheme which has never
been made ever come back to Islam also
you did say if I are against the Prime
Minister I don't think that's what Ron
Gant is saying he said that there was a
preliminary inquiry that was supposed to
be launched in the matter in the raw
fall deal let me run catch it early they
respond to so many spokesperson of
Congress party is making this kind of a
well it's a statement look at the rattle
BJP spokesperson oh my god that he has -
yes oh my lord so many lies just to
defend the lie of them don't resort to
lie those promises had made to the
people of this country in 2014
Shri Rahul Gandhi has spoken and
interacted and engaged with the media
and answered all the questions put
across to him we challenged mr. Narendra
Modi to come forward and answer all
these questions in a press conference to
all the media houses that really are in
the country today
what does she Rahul Gandhi speak about
he spoke about a referral scam is that
not correct that we still don't have
answers to why Indian Air Forces
requirement of 110
six aircrafts was reduced to 36 is it
not correct that HCl which was a
cash-rich company when we'd emitted
office today has to borrow money from
banks to pay their employees is it not
correct that HCl was denied the offset
contracts benefits to benefit a
particular private company which was
only 12 days old is it not correct that
prices of the rafael jet were increased
over and a deal was signed overnight is
it not correct that the Prime Minister
is running away from responsibility as
far as constituting a GPC is concerned
and would we be lying when we say that
without the Select Committee approval
the CBI director in an overnight coup
was asked to go on a compulsory leave
and Supreme Court had to teach them a
lesson on what Constitution mandates the
BJP government should do and what they
did was after the Supreme Court thrashed
them for what they had done they went
and hurriedly called as a select
committee meeting did not even give the
opposition the thousand page report and
today it is out in the open that how the
CVC report was used to get Alok Walmart
- damn it who office and again justice
but nanak has coming forward and
revealed that there were no corruption
charges and all the investigation report
that has come forward is not based on
his findings can I just come in please
lot of questions on Shri Narendra Modi
shoulder yes no I'm sorry you have asked
a lot of things you've said a lot of
things and you did not allow me to start
now mr. Rahul Gandhi is talking about
some bad truths which mr. Modi needs to
answer where are the two crores you need
to give me chance to remain he promised
whereas the mm SP that he promised to
the farmers and double-income to the
farm we're talking about that is the
government that he spoke about yes an
economy which was strong and and going
to you know better if this is the charge
that that then we are willing to take
forward any questions or allegations
that they may construe - yes all right
Priyanka Trivedi you made a specific
point about the BJP and the prime
minister destroying institutions in the
country dad's affair Islam respond to
that then I'm going to go to share it
with Ana's various vation waiting
patiently for Islam
say no see she is talking about that the
the a former CBI director mister Alok
Varma was sent on leave
there was sent only based on purely
based on the recommendation of CVC and
subsequently the the Honorable Supreme
Court only suggested the procedure
should be followed and while they they
didn't give it supreme court didn't give
any clean chit to a mr. Luke Varma in
fact all the serious charges against
talking about is of this watch he was
look at the manner in which the army egg
of now is pretty much okay Lord take a
call or whether the CBI director can be
sent on a leaf firstly get your facts
right understand what Constitution
mandates you to do it mandates approach
committee and take a call on this
allegation that the Congress has been
making of course the charge being led by
round Gandhi that the BJP doesn't
respect institutions beat the CBI BIA
the RBI be the Supreme Court it doesn't
respect any institution and those at the
helm of affairs in these institutions
are the ones or being armed twisted by
the BJP if they're working style does
not suit the BJP case in point CBI is
what Ron Gandhi says you think
allegations of this nature are going to
static
and and really define the narrative in
the run after 2019 I I'm pretty sure
that this will stick because these are
all hard facts okay and you know my the
first love is entitled to refute them
because every accused has a right to
defend the indefensible so so I have
nothing to say on that but the fact of
the matter is that as far as the Rafal
deal is concerned the basic question
that people on the street seem to ask
bill then why can't you disclose the
price of a particular product you are
buying it is not a car that anybody can
understand what are the attachments if
you buy a particular model of a car this
is an Air Force fighter aircraft where
nobody the most knowledgeable person
would not get a clue if you just
disclose the price okay you don't write
it then obviously it arouses suspicion
there there is something wrong
and the fact that the offset deal was
bent in favor of a private part by
person with 35,000 crores or thirty
thousand crores benefit going to that
person it is very obvious and why should
L I think this is the first time that HL
has been denied a job which it is an
expert in doing and you give it to a
company which is 15 days or 12 days old
and has no experience is very obvious
and as far as the CBI is concerned this
is this is common talk again then there
was something wrong that that which was
being going to be investigated by the
CBI director that is the reason that he
was shunted out this has happened this
kind of things happen in the government
whoever is in power and mind you defense
bills are no little for traditionally
for providing chunks of black money to
whoever is in power so this is this has
been happening so to tell you think that
the people are so innocent and blind has
to not understand what's going on under
the under the table is is very very nice
okay okay zephyr islam the other thing
that i want to discuss is what rahul
gandhi spoke about as far as his jibe
against the prime minister he's been
repeating this for a while now talking
about the suit boot kisser car and is
that the reason why the BJP in its
national council has actually passed a
resolution for the welfare of the poor
is the party concerned that
allegation that the BJP and Prime
Minister Modi are only for the rich
essentially is something that's going to
stick in the looks of my elections and
that could be a wedding situation for
you not at all let me let me respond to
two question one with Raksha Bandhan she
just now said that all the previous
deals the defense deals which has been
concluded by the government have they
had a middleman mr. Suraj Pradhan is
right that's that they had me UPI had
always middleman that's why karachi and
and anderson like people like him no no
no no no so that you are means basically
confirming that these people have taken
money here there is no bitch'll yes sir
we do not have no Nana we have concluded
transaction and we have clearly said
that pricing they were paying we are
paying 20% lower than different secondly
that absolutely clear we will ensure
that will be the poor people empower
women you know what you have to talk
about the points that are relevant to
this debate please
suffer a sloppier quick reaction from
Charlotte proton on BJP losing the
perception battle then I'm going to go
to Priyanka sharp with on quickly please
yeah yes is the BJP
already BJP and and the Prime Minister
Attlee lost a lot of credibility when he
came in 2015 14 he was hailed as the
some kind of a messiah of the country
but in four here's the way he lost and
every type people used to talk in 2014
that here is a man who's going to last
at least 10 years and in four years he
lost so much credibility that today
everybody is looking at him with
suspicion please deliver they failed to
deliver on various promises that they
made I mean everybody was taken in by
the kind of the the kind of utterances
he made people believed him but when you
betray in the faith of the people this
is what happens and today in three GOP
is graph has certainly gone down you
can't answer no no you can yes all I
like to say is yes when he spoke about
[ __ ] awliyas in the lulls the BJP
spokesperson little does he realize his
own BJP history because he's a recent
entrant let me remind him of about
Bangaru Laxman was caught in a sting
operation taking money on a defense deal
let me remind him about the coffin scam
while viva our brave soldiers of
fighting the Kargil war they were
earning money out of the martyrs who
were coming back in coffins let me
remind him about which was lifted in
2014 if someone has had this please the
first lady I would really want to ask
you some specific are the questions also
no drunk auntie's have to say about the
suitcase her car and the other things
that he's been talking about of this
government being throat rich essentially
but I'm afraid we are running out of
time that debate for another day but for
the moment I'm thanking Sherrod Pradhan
priyanka trivedi and zephyr islam for
sharing your views with us on that big
story of course exclusive interview of
Rahul Gandhi on network 18 but just
eight months after Congress and J Deus
formed post full Alliance and came
together to form the government in the
state of Karnataka poaching allegations
have made a comeback senior Congress
leader and Karnataka Minister TK Shiva
Kumar has alleged that the BJP was
trying to topple the state's coalition
government and that three millions were
camping in a hotel in Mumbai
along with BJP leaders now counter
countering congress's allegations chief
minister kumara Swamy has said that some
offers were made but a shock that the
emily's are still supporting the current
well even as poaching charges are being
leveled Karnataka Chief Minister HT
kumara Swamy sent a warning of sorts to
his alliance partner the Congress
Kumaraswamy says that his party should
not be treated as third grade citizens
and that both the partners need to adopt
a give and take policy
to put up a united fight against the BJP
in the upcoming looks of my elections
yeah water in the corner we go today
a lot of [ __ ] to the liquor some states
realize that 104 MLS we are intact and
we were in opposition party there there
some confusion is going on quarreling is
there in the vegetation Congress there
am difference of opinion a Marlo
Congress party code contains animals in
me in ketosis Bocelli time and again
they are fixing the muhurta but to their
unfortunate it is not happening it will
not happen
the government is stable we will
continue to be in their position if
Congress leaders resign if these leaders
resign and if Kumaraswamy could not
continue as the Chief Minister then we
will plan for the second stage details
she joins us from Bengaluru Stacy no
allegations and counter allegations
really find faking fast but at this
point in time it does appear that the
BJP is also little restless has given
the fact that BA said group has already
said that many of the MLAs are in fact
in Delhi and they're good to be here
what's really going on exactly that
statement from Hyderabad did put
everyone put a spin to this because all
the BJP and milliner's are intact we in
fact were there for that national
executive meeting that happened over the
weekend and that's where all the BJP MLA
is one so now a statement coming from
Kumar's family saying that you know it
definitely headed by is just creating
these stories that is his fantasy and if
there's no need for the current
coalition that needs to be poaching in
fact to the other end the counter
allegations of well yeah heat up
ourselves that yes we are in fact Kumar
strongly has spoken to one of our MLAs
and which is why we are going to hold up
all of our Emily the never thought in
gold now is doesn't hold any tools
because there's no need for the
coalition government here in Karnataka
to be looking or poaching BJP Emily's
and that's exactly what Kumaraswamy is
saying that they have enough of Emily is
to run the government and they don't
really need to be looking at BJP but
this whole story really transpiring
through the day when de queijo Kumar
said yes yeah he was aware of the fact
that there were three MLAs who were
holed up in Mumbai and well they were
BJP leaders meeting them there then you
did different various Congress remedies
that come out and speak about how even
though these remedies might be there in
Mumbai the
no fear for the government and the
government is going to be intact and
will be stable to the next five years
but in those comments you also heard JDS
you did hear it
kamaswami say that you know the gods
shouldn't treat as a third grade citizen
they should treat us as equal parts of
the universe that is probably the same
showing the gif does have enough muscle
to flex now with the looks of my
elections coming up and how much they
can you know try and get their coalition
partners to bend and thanks for that CC
shifting focus now well two people have
been arrested in connection with former
Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa
Koda an arduous state Drake in case the
accused have made a sensational claim
alleging that was Chief Minister Pauline
Swami who plotted against Jayalalitha
and ordered them to steal crucial papers
from her estate well in Swami has
dismissed these allegations as baseless
and said that strong action is going to
be taken against the culprits all right

s6_q0Uhg3vQ,Reporters Project | Is Government Wrong In Banning Commercial Surrogacy?,The Surrogacy Regulation bill passed in the Lok Sabha bans commercial surrogacy in India. Radhika Ramaswamy visits one of ...,2019-01-13T04:45:00Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s6_q0Uhg3vQ/hqdefault.jpg,"the just-concluded winter session of
parliament has seen a lot of action
among the many bills passed by the Lok
Sabha was the surrogacy Regulation Act
what this act will do when it becomes a
law which is when the Raja Sabha also
passes it is put an end to commercial
surrogacy now there is no doubt about
the fact that commercial surrogacy can
be exploited but it's also an undisputed
fact that many women do it voluntarily
because it's a good source of income
Radhika rhamaswami visits Anand and one
of the largest facilities for surrogacy
the Akanksha hospital to find out how
women are reacting to this proposed law
[Music]
from a distance this looks like a
regular day in a working women's hostel
[Music]
except that what you see is the basement
of a hospital and these women work as
commercial surrogates their job is to
bear children for strangers for a fee
most of the women here are from Ireland
and other places in Gujarat
all of them are compelled to do this

has no qualms about working as a

uncomfortable of a talking openly in
spite of the money it brings the
majority of them choose to keep it a
secret from the extended families
because of the stigma attached they
explain their absence by saying they
have moved to the city in search of jobs
[Music]
twenty-six-year-old Chandni sana schwa
is one such woman she says her husband
is supportive of what she's doing but
she doesn't want her neighbors to know
rod she plans to use the money she will
earn here up to five lakh rupees to get
her injured arms fixed and also to
educate her kids she's waiting for
reports that will confirm whether or not
the embryo transfer has been successful

about hundred such commercial surrogates
are currently living at the Akanksha
hospital in anand an assisted
reproductive technology specialty
hospital run by dr. Nina Patel
it produced its first surrogate baby in
January 2004 and is the largest
surrogacy center in the country women
who are hired can be anywhere between
the ages of 23 and 40 they are housed
here for the entire term of the
pregnancy and their health and
well-being monitored carefully a woman
can earn between 4 to 5 lakh rupees for
each delivery and an additional lakh if
she delivers twins ironically they
receive more care and attention as
surrogates than they do when they have
their own babies the aapke own but

waiter some name will happen how the
difference but I never carry karna
Bannatyne syrup a dude na Scotch I
sometimes or a typo period a year ago
but this unexpected source of good
fortune may soon become a thing of the
past
the practice of commercial surrogacy is
expected to stop soon as the Lok Sabha
has just passed the surrogacy regulation
bill which bans commercial surrogacy
it's now waiting for the Rajya Sabha to
clear it not surprisingly no one here is
happy about it the surrogates will have
a tough time because as you heard in the
morning they said that this big amount
of money even if we work 24 by 7 and for
our lifetime both of us we will not be
able to save it what we can do it in 9
months so their main dream of building
the house or educating their children
sending them for higher education will
be deprived and they will not see that
day so in a way there was a time when
15,000 of population of Anand was
surviving with surrogacy which has come
down a little and now it will be
virtually zero who will be surviving on
surrogacy and that would be a huge
impact for a town which has a population
of 250,000
the new law will allow only ultra-stick
surrogacy which means women can no
longer be hired as surrogates what makes
it tougher is that only a close relative
of the couple can volunteer the age of
the surrogate will be limited to between
25 and 35 years and only heterosexual
infertile couples who have been legally
married for at least five years can use
surrogates violation of the new law will
land everyone involved the medical
practitioner the couple and the
surrogate in jail for up to 10 years in
addition to having to paste her finds
this build what has been proposed like a
near relative can do it who has to be 23
to 35 with one living child that is fine
but a near relative who will come up now
people want to even hide that they have
infertility from their relatives then
there is no compensation
why somebody is working for you you
compensate them if you don't compensate
nobody is going to come up and do this
surrogacy for you so virtually and their
age like 35 years if a mother wants to
do for her daughter she cannot do it but
she'll not be 35 she'll be 45 but she
cannot do it so looking at all this it
is more of a ban rather than regulation
the government wants to put an end to
commercial surrogacy they say there is
massive exploitation women are forced
into becoming surrogates and it poses
risk to their health as they do it
repeatedly while the bill may have been
passed with good intentions many say it
is vague and misplaced as the ground

[Music]
with over 7,000 fertility clinics spread
across the country producing 2,000
babies via surrogacy every year
commercial surrogacy is a whopping
thousand crore rupee industry anand the
dairy capital of India has become a
popular destination for surrogacy with
3,000 people employed in the trade there
is enormous supply and demand for
surrogacy in the country with the ban
the practice will most likely go
underground but the fear is that it
could lead to domestic violence
trafficking and abuse while hospitals
and fertility clinics will continue to
flourish as people looking to have
babies childless couples and surrogate
mothers will be hit the hardest visiting
the homes of a few women who have been
surrogates we saw how much credit these
people give to surrogacy for

but the sentiments of the women who have

hello and welcome to the Tekken Auto
Show I'm your postman of Cena and it is
so good to see all of you once again at
that one show which satisfies your
hunger of both technology as well as
automobiles just like every time we have
a lot lined up for you in the next half
an hour so have a look at what's coming
your way this week we find out whether
we have a new Android smartphone King
and find out whether that is finally a
map of alternative and also the track
octa-core is put to the ultimate test
[Music]
three as all of that is coming your way
but we are gonna start off by showing
you an alternative to the Apple MacBook
Air now Kunal got his hands on this
laptop it is the Dell XPS 15 and he
believes this might be the best Windows
laptop in the world
[Music]
so if you think Apple's new MacBook Pro
is the best notebook on the market you
probably right but what if you want
something with Microsoft Windows was a
nice balance of work and play well then
the Dell XPS 15 is your best bet
[Music]
unlike the XPS 13 which did get a design
update the new XPS 15 follows the same
design pattern as its predecessor
continuity is a strong point and this is
undoubtedly one of the best build
laptops on the market you get an
aluminum chassis on the top and bottom
with a carbon fiber pattern finish
around the deck and excellent display
with technically no gazelles they have
very minor noticeable design changes and
overall it feels just as premium as an
XPS machine should be the XPS lineup is
known for its great displays and Dell
offers an option for full HD or 4k
resolution 15.6 inch infinity edge panel
while I reviewed the 1080p version both
look great especially when you're
watching blu-ray movies notably the full
HD version has a matte finish while the
high resolution photo option supports
touch input and has a glossy finish in
the connectivity Department not much has
changed as you get the same set of ports
including a USB 3.1 and HDMI 2.0 a
headset and mic combo jack a USB C with
Thunderbolt 3 point of support and a
barrel charging code on the left hand
side on either side you get another USB
3.1 and SD reader and a quick battery
indicator with a security lock board
you also get killer branded Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth combo which is always nice to
have while the machine was announced
with a powerful Intel Core online
version dell has only lost two variants
in india with the latest eighth
generation intel core i7 8 7 5 0 each
processor
it is paired with 16gb ddr4 a lot of
cars here at use 18 and we tried to
answer most of the questions that you
might be having about it
our ultimate test though is the long
term test of a vehicle wherein we try to
understand the ownership experience and
try to figure out all the small niggles
that might come over time the latest car
to undergo that test is a Tata to God
how did it fare well take a look
[Music]
if I were to tell you one of the most
talked-about cars on our channel and
perhaps one of the most asked about cars
then it has to be the Tata to God and to
find the answers to most of that
questions we decided to spend some
thousand kilometers with it and here's
what to think about it
[Music]
well to start off we spent exactly four
months with the car during which we
drove it for a total of a little bit
over 8,000 kilometers the variant we
tested was a top spec egghead model
which pretty much gets all the bells and
whistles that data has to offer with the
Tagore
so with that established let's get to
what we loved about the car now one of
the things that impressed me the most
about the Tata T God during all these
kilometers it has to be the driving
feedback that this car offers and the
engine on board yes it is a one-litre
three-cylinder engine option but it
never left me wanting for more we drove
the diesel engine powered variant of the
Tagore that comes with a five-speed
manual transmission now this is the same
engine that powers the tiago as well and
is also in the exact same state of tune
the difference is that the Tagore is
about 50 kilos heavier than the tiago
and that difference can be felt the car
feels slightly gamma2 Drive and almost
everything about it is turned down a
notch but that isn't exactly a bad thing
as the car feels calm and composed
something you would expect out of a car
from this segment the power and torque
are ample but the best part is a driving
feedback that it offers the de Gaulle
feels just so planted during turns and
even at highway speeds that you would
feel that you are in the full-size sedan
it soaked up all the bad patches of
roads with ease and you don't have to
work the engine for those quick
overtakes in the city the only thing
that they didn't like was the levels of
sound insulation inside the cabin while
it is good at cancelling out the ambient
noise the same cannot be said for the
sound coming from the engine bay as it
gets pretty loud at higher rpms
but you'll forgive the engine for being
noisy when you consider the kind of
mileage it delivered during the four
months that we had the car with us we
drove it mostly through back to Delhi
roads with the a/c on at all times and
the car still managed to deliver over 21
kilometers to the litre and that's
impressive keep in mind though that the
Tagore has two driving modes on offer
city and eco and we mostly left it in
city because Eco dulls down the car
a bit too much but then again that's a
personal preference and it could work
just fine for you and it only gets
better when we talk about the design of
the car now one of the reasons why you
would
that article in the first place is the
extra boots based on offer but here's
the thing the boot in itself is not some
ugly rectangular design which has been
slapped onto the back of a hatchback to
make it look like a sedan but perhaps it
gives the car a character of its own by
giving it a coupe a light stance this is
due to the roofline which merges
seamlessly into the boot lid which makes
the tagore stand out of the crowd this
is further accentuated by the top
mounted brake lights which run across
the width of the rear glass panel and
look great
another interesting bit is that the boot
lid hinges do not intrude into the
loading bay making it convenient to
store luggage also the LED tail lamps
look fantastic and the boot lid cleverly
integrates the rear parking camera from
the front though the car has a
resemblance to the Tiago but gets a
different set of projector headlamps
which get the smooth treatment overall
it is one of the better-looking
offerings in the segment and the good
bits continue when we talk about the
interiors as well the design of the
cabin is fantastic and Tata has filled
the car with cubby holes all over 24 to
be exact and the fact that all four
doors can hold a one liter bottle is a
welcome addition but the best part about
the decor was the in-car audio
experience the 8 speaker setup is
hands-down the best in the segment and
for the driver well the seats are height
adjustable and so is the steering wheel
which really lets you alter the driving
position as per your preference to a
great extent all in all the tagore
delivered at almost every front and
while there were a few things it could
have done better
it mostly was all the car one needs for
the daily runabout and weekend getaways
so to wrap up the entire time spent with
the tatata God well let's keep it simple
the Tata tagore gives good fuel economy
looks good drives good has decent
practicality on offer as well and then
you through in the equation of price
well that makes the Tata tagore one of
the best value for money compact sedans
to have in India right now
[Music]
now it is time to talk about smart
phones and we have something really
special and that one promises to be the
king of Android phones what we're
talking about is the huawei mate 20 Pro
it has a good build quality a good
design a good battery life and a good
camera - but is it perfect well there's
no one better to tell you that then
Michelle who's coming up next
huawei plate the waiting game very
smartly they waited for the likes of
Samsung and Google to reveal their 2018
Android flagship cards before emerging
from the shadows all guns blazing as it
may because the May 20 Pro is the
geekiest Android phone you can buy it
right now but is this really for you we
find out the May 20 pros design is
perhaps what we can classify as a mature
design for a large phone the May 20 pro
is surprisingly pocketable it sits
slightly to the spec sheet will tell you
it weighs 189 grams but hold it up and
it is deceptively light if you have a
second phone that supports wireless
charging you'll simply need to hold this
phone to the back of the May 20 pro and
voila the charging starts inside of the
4200 mAh battery which relies on
artificial intelligence to understand
which apps are used often and which you
don't to keep the unnecessary ones at
bay there's the kidron 980 processor
which is also having a seven nanometer
architecture the Apple a 12 Bionic which
past the iPhone 10s Dennis Max and the
10s are run the other chip in the
industry built on this architecture
there are advantages in terms of
powerful performance and more frugal
power consumption as compared with other
smartphone chips that run the 10
nanometer architecture the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 805 included despite
fantastic performance software on the
May 20 Pro still looks a little rough
for a top-notch Android flagship phone
for starters the interface does not look
very different from other Huawei forms
this necessarily isn't a positioning
what you want to give to a flagship
some of the customizations absolutely
make no sense the May 20 Pro gets a
primary 40 megapixel sensor paired with
a 20 megapixel and an 8 megapixel sensor
the 40 megapixel resolution photos pull
an excellent amount of detail which can
come in very handy when you're editing
them later
daytime and good light photos are crisp
and vibrant though we surprisingly
noticed a slight boost in certain colors
if the master a I feature is turned off
the huawei May 20 Pro is packed with a
lot of features that incidentally used
to be Samson's party piece at one point
of time what were we have managed with
the May 20 Pro is put it all together
without it resembling a mess this is one
of the best performing best-looking and
best camera phones that you can spend
your precious money on right now
recently we got in touch with Oppo to
find out how is the Indian market
different from other global markets and
what are their plans for India in the
coming future take a look at a
conversation up next
[Applause]
I sing the inside like the local local
insight is very important so we actually
have very strict based strict standard
on the research part as we observed in
the past we think that the camera and
the battery and the design will probably
be the most important elements for the
Indian customers so that is why we
decided to introduce book and again the
super look into India when the super
work technology can charge your phone
from zero to 40 percent only in 10
minutes so this is our unique patented
colobus I've seen these kind of inside
can help us to stand out in the

it's also called the taco dance from
Seoul a reference outdated avoid ignore

rishabh month who is completely underage
for dancing fabulously to give a
backstory
by the way the Aussie theme soft no
slashing approach backfired so after
losing the series 2-1 to India the
Aussie star is sledging again and by
Aussies I don't mean the players I mean
the Aussie public was sledging there all
players think about it it's almost like
Australia and India exchange
personalities India has a aggression and
the sledging Aussies were quiet and
after the series the Indian team
celebrated all night not the Aussies the
garmiskar border trophy was given away
only by border as the Aussies forgot to
call the Oscar
now that's Ozzie's behaving like us
praise the same team India used to
behave after winning a series finally at
the start of the series Khali was
calling rubbish on the rush when a
shrimp boy but after the Sydney Test and

show-cause notices to hardik Pandya and
KL rahul for their comments on sex and
women on the current Johar show should
they have been issued show-cause notices
much earlier for something worse their
hairstyles fashion statements this I'm a
fine one to talk lots more coming up but
first here are the headlines
10% quota for general category poor
upper caste clears Parliament now said
to be a law chips in and Beach Ibiza
lines in trouble will other be linked
with driving license and I spoke to Auto
Punk err on his latest film our top
story in a masterstroke though I prefer
visa I'm not coming I don't pluck unless
they pay money we don't blog and a
masterstroke ahead of the general
elections and what may prove to be a
game-changer the Modi government this
week approved 10 percent reservation in
all jobs and education for the
economically backward upper castes now
while this seems like a good idea let's
try and understand what this means in
reality joining us now is a
for my economic adviser and deputy
director of the National Commission of
social justice we have the department
and empowerment we also have that
department and this gentleman says his
cost is unknown but for a certain amount
of money
he'll convert to any cost sir so what is
your annual income why what why must I
am only trying to ascertain whether you
are economically backward or not
although by the looks of it you don't
seem economically backward at all maybe
intellectually backward the thing about
being all that before you think you can
scare me but how do you determine who is
economically backward and who is not I
mean what is the definition of
economically weak can you tell us now
that is a good question as provided
under this proposed amendment if your
total income of your household which
includes the income of your parents is
below rupees 8 lakh per annum then you
are deemed economically weak below eight
legs economic gimmick I see going on
which means let's say your wife's income
is to like say here
your father's income is also 2 lakhs a
year and your income is a little more 4
lakhs a year which is 8 lakhs you are
not eligible in case you wish to become
eligible for this 10 percent quota you
will either have to throw your wife or
your father out of the house wife or
father this is not going to be an easy
choice what about go on please go on
what are the criteria the other criteria
to ascertain whether you are from the
economically backward class and are
indeed entitled to 10% reservation is if
you own a residential plot measuring
less than 100 yards or a house that is
smaller than a thousand square foot Wow
less than a thousand square feet by that
logic sir whatever income may be 99
percent of people living in Mumbai can
be termed economically weak
[Laughter]
not only that do you know which segment
of Indian society meets all requirements
for the ten percent reservation quota no
please tell me who which segment of
Indian society has an income of below 8
lakhs per annum also owns the
residential plot measuring less than a
hundred yards or a house that is smaller
than thousand square feet or own
agricultural land below five acres and
who can be officially called
economically weak are they stop showing
off mama just tell us whoo-hoo 98% of
all Indians 98% of all Indians I don't
know why I'm smiling that's not a good
thing but even if this had to work how
will you know who owns more and who owns
less I mean is there a process is there
an algorithm a mechanism a system income
tax income tax yes we will know what you
earn based on whether you file income
tax returns or not which slab you come
under or whether you pay income tax at
all I see I see so if you do not pay
income tax you are economically weak
okay which means that Vijay Mallya may
hold talks with neither body and all
black marketers will be hereafter deemed
as economically we are people who have
homes in London bank accounts in
Switzerland travel the world that have
houses everywhere and never return to
India like Sri could always make a
director of the show we like to tell the
truth comedies about the truth we put
the truth on the table and we let you
lap it up thinking of lapping it up the
Shiv Sena and the BJP is nearly 30 year
old Alliance in Maharashtra seems to be
on a very thin ground it's a bit like
the roads in Mumbai where the holes keep
happening the doctor don't know with
both allies hurling the choices of
abuses this is true at each other
they've been calling each other names it
all started when BJP president Amit Shah
in a speech said that he was trash I
quote trash special Sinha in the coming
Lok Sabha polls in response up in arms
and prepared for war senior Shiv Sena
leader Ram Dass Kadam said I will bury
repeat very
yes ready right ready sounds like a rock
group let's just think about this for a
second
crash and bury then we stop using those
words anymore in what third grade
unless you're killed Raul in hardik
Pandya anything anytime Muffy Mungo ma
fille those I'll say Muffy
why I didn't click it as behaving like
Aziz let's move back to the story
joining us now is a Ledge spokesperson
for the Shiv Sena Ramnath Karim well I
don't know if he's ramanatham but he is
something Josh and put Leda cometh they
took God and God a big you know why I'm
smiling I'm smiling because that guy
looks like he deserves to be beaten
it is also be beaten and hey why are you
betting I'm listening to all your talk
and who are you bearing in the mud is
that some BJP fellow you are bearing in
the mud just be clear about that huh
because I have mail Assam that BJ
because nom de l'été car let's go for
the BJP in the Shiv Sena ah what do you
want to know the BJP in the Shiv Sena
don't seem to be getting along for yours
actually and at the moment there seems
to be a lot of acrimony well it is that
carry money honey there is no money no
no no no no no there is a lot of
acrimony no actually money
the problem is with BJP they want
everything for free
what meaning all right they are not
willing to pay any money
how will they agree to pay acrimony hey
I'm not understanding I mean there seems
to be a lot of malice
mohnish what do they think they are we
refused all knowledge tonight
they want mileage all the time they
manage their egos because we are the
shoe Sena we will not give my leash and
anything to their egos not male I'm
trying to say the word malice are they
same to same thing and I know it's not
it's not the same thing
I was speaking of malice and by malice I
meant it seems there's a lot of bad
blood bad blood
bad luck that bad blood our blood is not
bad
their blood must be bad of the highest
quality of that ah we are at issue Adi
Maharaj bla that is what is running you
like going into my wife you know nothing
is making any sense you still don't get
my point I'm asking you a very simple
question baba ji why is there so much
antipathy between the two parties
antipathy what is this anybody you asked
me about homeopathy natural I will tell
you what is this antipathy whose party
like Timothy I was just showing off but
obviously you don't understand when you
answer the English language I got 82% in
cinzia's college in 1994 don't use this
big big words a very simple question
I'll put it very simply what is the
problem between the Shiv Sena and the
BJP no come on now
that is a simple question ah yes yes an
answer it the problem is the shoe sena
is the better party than the BJP no no
you can't just do labels there how can
you say that what is the reasoning hey I
will tell you who is the leader of Shiv
Sena tell me the late Ballas I'm sorry
who is the leader of BJP under in ramadi
then how can he when you compare why
what's the logic hey Baba how can you
compare the grade by aseptically who's
been played by nawazuddin siddiqui yeah
and narendra modi is played by vivek
oberoi
who is better
ah that's an interesting so have you
reached your destination have you fallen
into a pothole are you stuck in a metro
work displayed what is going on in the
beautiful city you sensational movie
that's being made called gully boy sorry
when we sing we'll play boys for the
next 20 years
boys what a rapper who is going places
you know comes from the Army and then
goes to the top well I love the first
album about Mumbai in fact let me sing
the title track it's really catchy girly
girly may sure hear some music composer
tour Hey Imran Khan Prime Minister of
Pakistan congratulated India on the
tremendous victory of Australia in
Australia see he wants peace apparently
he said congratulations to India without
Kashmir
apparently I no diploma the other card
still remains as controversial as ever
if you remember in September the Supreme
Court limited the use of other card this
week Lok Sabha passed a bill to try and
circumvent some of the Supreme Court
restrictions also Union Minister for
information technology Ravi Shankar
Prasad personal friend announced that
the government would soon make it
mandatory for linking other with driving
licences so to keep both in your hands
while driving where else do you think
the other car may become mandatory let's
talk to an alleged spokesperson of well
from somewhere joining us now is this
from somewhere late spokesperson of a
Ravi Shankar Prasad Sri Ravi Shankar
Prakash sir
India is a technology giant we have 100
billion mobile phones in India we have
900 billion Internet connections in
India we have over 100 million credit
cards in India we have 90 million other
cards in India and do you know which
cards we have the most in India which
cards wedding cards 5000 billion cards
there's an 1,000 billion for one wedding
alone we won't talk about the other
cards sir we see previously it was
compulsively
mandatory to voluntarily get yourself
and as our card the way you put it
I am completely confused now it is no
longer like that it is voluntarily
compulsively to mandatorily get another
card and now I say and even more
confused don't be confused we will talk
about other card but before that let me
ask you a question all right go ahead
how can you prove that Ravi Shankar
Prasad is a union minister in India ah
good question how by asking for his on
our card yes yes good good good really
every morning Modi ji asks for another
card and only then he says talk to him
admire but he doesn't ask anybody else
the other concern gentleman for the
record okay gone gone gone now show me
yours
what Oh when you said show me yours is
the party of God therefore I don't have
I don't have it yet you don't have an R
card that how do I know you are Cyrus
brooch ah you could be an imposter you
could be Barkha Dutt smell is similar
but she has much less experience in the
news format so I would not like to brag
but please go on so now we have decided
to link the other card to your driving
licence how is that going to help you
can go to a town in Mumbai for example
pay 2,000 rupees and get a driving
license that is exactly why the other
card is going to be linked to the
driving licence please explain so that
you will never ever have to go to a tout
pay 2,000 rupees and get a driving
licence wow that's good you've changed
the system that's good never now you
will have to go to a tout pay 4000
rupees and get a driving license and
other card 4000 rupees we are going to
soon link the other card to everything
like like what else like air tickets
train tickets
tickets even cinema tickets even cinema
tickets so what's the point
have you seen the film Simba of course
not
in the film Simba how do you know which
actor is Singham and which actor is
Simba because one is a they've gone and
the other reason we sing no because both
will have to show their other cards
during the performance by the way have
you been on tinder why you notice
something the dating and sex are you
talking about we have decided to make
tinder six safe how by making other
compulsory on tinder yes no longer will
you use rubber you will now use plastic
that's going a bit far really not at all
in fact we are going to link up other
card to voting as well you can fold
through other cast your vote how's that
even possible only so far we are having
some technical difficulties
what is this technical difficulty up to
now we've managed to put only one voting
option on the other card what does that
mean only one option on the other card
for voting the Lotus option how many
politicians famous celebrities etcetera
have you noticed on tinder could you
give us a list of names with the other
cards first show me your other card you
give your other card first
no show me your other kind yes yes stop
the week that was in elevating comedy
one word at a time yours unabomb care
star with the accidental prime minister
the controversial film released this
week the film sparked two wrongs
Congress supporters as well it shows
Manmohan Singh as a victim the film
takes direct potshots at the Gandhi
family
what is also being questioned is whether
the timing of the film's release and the
whole film itself I don't know how do I
put this is politically motivated and
supported by the BJP
I mean it's just an idea somebody's come
up with may be true may not be true
nobody knows joining us to discuss all
that is lead actor and superstar auto
palm care who never charges me for a
conversation
then doesn't talk to me I don't care
welcome to the show name Matt debate
mininum it's not that kind of show with
that kind of anchor you know no oh by
the way I heard you like that anchor
does those debates don't you he has had
fight with on on every level with
everybody okay I've been singing it to
everybody I agree buzz buzz are you guys
like each other I've seen your live in
coffee together a couple of times a
 but your thumb with your no no
don't relax relax
oh no mom it's me are we're friends okay
won't talk about him that's not the
interview again let's just have a normal
decent interview come on much better
I'll also give a look I don't care
welcome to the show Angie Namaskar
Namaskar Namaskar twice people are
saying that the film is politically
motivated question number one yeah
really yeah also saying the film is
copied from Rohit Shetty Simba will need
is he up after prepare it's no
difference to me I'm not very upset I
like Simba I would love to see Simba
your version as well but they are saying
that it's copied from a road Shetty film
to achieve out there I think it's
fantastic
let me and the view understand this
accidental Prime Minister's actually
like Simba the road Shetty sort of film
doesn't have any action sequences does
it have cars flying roll Gandhi flying
really that kind of film is - me up
which we've got sucked there
that's our reply is - may up goose
because at a certain expression from the
film
very interesting so when you were making
accidental prime minister what is the
biggest lesson that you learned a
pradhan mantri go Valadez obtain
oh you mean ex pradhan mantri but not
been predominantly drinking water not
answering keep wanting to run away every
time I ask you a slightly tough question
come on say that again do you think I
don't know all this I've been doing this
from college days like what I said so up
which people took their freedom of
expression can ampere that's in the show
how do you think we will feel when we as
an audience watch this film it will make
you uncomfortable
like how I feel now here on the show are
the seats small yeah okay what else
popcorn and cold is available or not
why not of course okay now how are the
other performances in the film come on
you rate them buy a ticket and see it I
think the small trailer no this is not
the way I want to okay no need to get
upset
dony to get upset why don't we just talk
about your performance your performance
as Manmohan Singh give us a sample of
that performance great ready yeah and
action
I excuse me what's nothing nothing is
happening on a bum look what isn't
saying anything you're not doing
anything
that's completely how much I get it this
is the performance this is the title the
silent Prime Minister it's superb what a
performance brilliant are you going to
show dr. Manmohan Singh this film yeah I
see and what do you think he'll be
thinking after he sees the film it's
hurtful
it's also upsetting are you going to
show the film to Rahul Priyanka Sonia
yeah when after 50 years but hey when is
it some reason I'm on 15th August 26
january or eid or Diwali or New Year's
Eve at seventh office also - it's my
birthday I'll leave that right there but

Prime Minister this country has ever had

question PS so to speak is it true those
son of three will star you with Nasir
Uddin Shah yeah good superb

DxB6sQZYh6w,Selection Panel Sacks CBI Boss| Viewpoint,Inside story on selection panel removing CBI boss Verma. It was seen that Kharge was adamant and against Alok Verma's ...,2019-01-11T02:36:24Z,CNN-News18,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DxB6sQZYh6w/hqdefault.jpg,"this our Alok Verma sector CBI chief he
will now be DG fire services now what
transpired in that meeting of the
selection committee that went on for
over two hours this evening from 4:30
p.m. to all the way beyond 6:30 p.m.
this evening PMO sources are telling CNN
news 18 that Mallikarjun carga was
adamant and was against a loop Varma's
removal the prime minister and justice
sikri were on the other side in this
debate really just a secret agreed with
the CVC report and the prime minister
then tried to convince a Mallikarjun car
guy on each and every allegation that
was made in the CVC report against Alec
Varma but what we believe is that
Mallikarjun car gave was not convinced
with those arguments just as sikri also
tried to as they helped him understand
some legal points finally Prime Minister
Modi told a Mallikarjun car gate to give
a dissenting note which was ultimately
given by Mallikarjun car gay the
government was also clear that is the
Prime Minister was clear here that this
is not a hearing for aloo Parma so it's
not as if any chance is required for him
to clarify on these allegations that
have been put forth by the Central
Vigilance Commission report our enemy is
now joining us with the very latest on
that irony mites
ironical that the person Mallikarjun car
game was against in the first place of
the appointment of a local arma today
was the only one defending him perhaps
was appointed a CBI director then
Mallikarjun he had given a dissenting
note because he wanted our cudahy
thought RK doctor was a fitter candidate
for becoming the CBI director now when a
low Pharma is being moved out of CBI
once again Mallikarjun Kalka is given a
giving a dissenting note because he
feels our karma is the right man he
should not be moved out so just as the
government has come a full circle on on
what it thinks about a low Pharma they
backed him once they wanted him insisted
on him as the CBI director at one point
now they are the ones who want him out
because of these allegations of
corruption full-circle life has come for
three people
the Prime
mr. Mallikarjun car gay and for Alok
Varma as well when mr. kargh is stepped
out of the Prime Minister's residence
he looked grim his body language
definitely was not that of a man who was
happy with what had gone on and that
meeting had gone on for close to two and
a half hours that perhaps explains
because you know that the long time that
it took the cabinet ministers were all
waiting 6:30 there was a cabinet meeting
the ministers were all waiting at the
Prime Minister's residence at the
waiting Hall because it was taking a lot
of times to convince Malika Dzhokhar gay
both just a secret and the Prime
Minister we're trying to reason with him
but he was adamant he was absolutely
adamant that all of Varma must be given
a chance to put forth his viewpoint the
allegations of corruption the Central
Vigilance Commission report came out old
became the base animal for the prime
minister and just to see okay just hold
on to your thoughts daddy runs in charge
of the Congress is also joining us on
the phone line so your first reactions
to the fact that a low Padma has been
sacked as the CBI chief somebody that
the Congress party towards the end of
his tenure really was batting for first
of all by all accounts in an episode in
regard to Alabama does not augur well
for the premier institution Sibylline
the first removal replacement director
reinstatement at the behest of Supreme
Court it will all come together then it
will be revealing that something is
making suspicious first of all the
hardness with which the government has
reacted to the restatement of Alec Verma
certainly raises the scrutiny days ones
eyebrows I am not satisfying the
integrity or the solidity of a lot Burma
okay but circumstantial but the
circumstantial evidence suggests that
something is making suspicious
presenting at this time is that he was
going to look into the recording a
diligent you agree is the only argument
that the Congress is presenting at this
point is that he was going to look into
the Rafal Dean re-run jewelry all right
phone disconnected there let me I'll
quickly go across to Z ba VAR see who's
standing by the Congress headquarters
the Congress party is going to hold a
press conference shortly
meanwhile the Congress party is already
tweeted saying by removing all of Parma
from his position without giving him the
chance to present his case Prime
Minister Modi has shown once again that
he is too afraid of an investigation
either by an independent CBI director or
by Parliament via a jpc clearly ziba the
target once again of the Congress party
will be the fact that they want to bring
this entire argument around Rafal deal
correct
certainly maha that is going to be the
focus of the congress party and that is
also what will be a reiterated in the
press conference that is going to be
held a short while from now are likely
to be chaired by Anand Sharma senior a
leader of the Congress party they will
try to drive the message home that this
entire process was done to to cover up a
supposin alleged rafael scam now Mallika
Chen kegui the leader of the Communist
Party and who was representing at the
Congress party in that selection
committee Oh gave a dissent note T to
Allah Karma's removal a CBI director he
was vehemently opposing it and the key
grounds on which he was opposing was the
fact that our local Roma has not been
given a fair chance to present his case
before the selection committee he also
went on to say that the CVC o is himself
in the door and how can his charges be
be taking on face value his charges
against our local ma should be probed
that is what Mallikarjun cardi raised as
as an objection a tool a Luke Rama's
removal before the selection committee
okay of course with a ratio of 2 to 1
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and justice
secret both are both moved
aliquot much less about removal but here
at the congress headquarters the mood is
all set there will be your press
conference in a short while from now I
promise we will reiterate that Alok
warme was removed a CBI director because
he would have proved their fealty
alright ziba Arunima a Natisha are going
to stay with us let me also introduce
our panelists this evening professor
Cordova love spokesperson of the
Congress party is here with us in the
studio suffer Aslam spokesperson of the
BJP and saith Assad Abbas political
analyst is with us first across to you
God Avila this argument that at a low
Burma was not given a chance to present
his case before the selection committee
now
Alok Varma was given a chance to present
his case before the CBC based on which
report today the decision has been taken
see let us start from the beginning 77
days back he was removed midnight at two
o'clock now tell me which CVC officer
work at two o'clock and midnight which
PMO officer work at two o'clock midnight
it means they are planning for that
anyhow for 77 days Supreme Court took a
time and they came to know that you
can't do this thing it has to be
referred to a particular committee who
had appointed it in two hours in two
hours time Prime Minister Modi's have
concluded that there is a bribe he there
is a financial irregularity mr. a
lukewarm eyes there is a dissent don't
and we live in a democratic country
before charging anyone are you not do
don't you agree that there is a
principle of natural justice the
opportunity of being heard should be
given so why he's so scared he was given
an opportunity to be heard before the
scene I am saying that is all the scene
I am saying when Supreme Court had
mentioned that the same committee should
look into that the same committee in two
hours had concluded everything I'm
saying why you are so afraid
mati dad this hearing was not democratic
he should have been hard say there are
two things which is important for
everyone to know first the distant which
was taken by the government earlier was
based on the recommendation by CVC then
he the CVC did give him a chance to
appear and present his case subsequently
the Honorable Supreme Court only
suggested talked about the processes
that the process will select this way
they this committee can only take a call
the high powered important committee can
take a call about his transfer or
sending him on leave so ok some for
Islam just a second I want to bring in
our deputy editor Arunima
our anima is this a requirement that the
person in question here elope where ma
should have been given a chance before
the selection committee as well to
present his points after all when the
CVC was probing this matter he was given
a chance to speak and this was overseen
by Justice but nyuk and that is what mr.
Karle kept saying he insisted that how
can you decide on whether Verma is
guilty or not without giving him a
chance to give his side of the story but
that was a position which was not agreed
to by the prime minister that was a
position which didn't find merit with
justice secret as well what they said
was that this is not really a trial or
this is not really you know a que is
going on where Verma must be pronounced
guilty and therefore he must be given a
chance what we think is that in in light
of these allegations his continuance in
the position of CBI director because of
some merit has been found as far as the
CDC is concerned the CDC's inquiry again
headed by a judicial officer you know
retired the Justice okay has found merit
with both justice sikri as well as prime
minister and in
their capacity as members of the
selection committee they ruled by two
one moralo pharma is unfit to continue
as director of the Central Bureau of
Investigation say it I said Abbas do you
agree with the Congress party that all
this has been done in a hurry because
Alok Varma and this is based on a
presumption was going to ask for a
preliminary inquiry into the Rafal case
let me tell speak as a citizen of this
country here it is really shocking my
height is definitely very very shocking
and it's very obnoxious to see the state
of affairs in India there's one side
that is a lukewarm at the other side
there is Rakesh Astana we clearly see
two political parties taking the ends
Congress towards our Aloha
BJP towards Rakesh Astana now what is
happening here today the state of affair
we saw it we toured out I look what
mama's vetoed out by majority to is to
one sikri and our honorable Prime
Minister Narendra Modi once one sign
leader of opposition Mali cartoon car
Giggy on one side precisely now let
let's make it very clear innocent until
proven guilty yes I do agree with you I
do agree with a new image oshi that mr.
a lukewarm ah should have been heard
before any verdict coming through this
way be as a citizen we will lose the
faith in the law and the government if a
veto dictation but is followed but Abbas
it was agreed upon both by the prime
minister as well as just a secret that
this is not a trial or hearing they were
basing their arguments on the CVC report
but then where is the concrete proof
where is the concrete evidence with no
substantial evidence proof has been
overseas my justice Pattanaik if we are
going to question every protein there's
no end to questioning that is also just
a second sir can I just come I'll come
to you a bus definitely Maha Maha I do I
do agree with you you have made a very
valid point but then I'll look my
only insisting point is that a lukewarm
ah should have been definitely heard
after which if this was the what it
followed law above all else we
definitely accept it
all right meet Isha Allah Padma now
shunted out to being DG file services
clearly a downgrading there well yes why
in fact this is actually a di G ranked
post and not just that it has just got
one battalion in it so definitely it's a
it's a sort of punishment and also he
has been shunted from being a CBI
directed to now D G fire and only only
two in the last two days he has made
several of the transfers in the CPI
itself from from those who were
transferred by an nageshwara they all
those transfers have been reverted back
and today also some six transfers were
made by I look one more now the question
arises whether not these transfers will
again be reverted or these transfers
will continue so is the CBI only going
to have going to see transfer of the
official offices or actuals or some
actual work is going to happen now we
have to see in the communities there as
if there's a very important point atisha
that you've raised here this did this
ongoing churn within the CBI how what
does it mean for the institution itself
as we will try and understand that as
well with people who have worked with
the CBI to understand how it's actually
hampering the work of this premier
investigating agency but I want to go
across to go develop who's here in the
studio because he wanted to make a point
I'm saying now government had proved
beyond doubt that Prime Minister is
fearing for an F IR against him under
their awfully scam and why I am I'm
surprised
when when he was first said the CVC was
going to Denmark on that day maja are
you aware that she DC was planned to go
to Denmark on the I can sell the tickets
I shall then he passed the order two
o'clock then Supreme Court gave a tight
slap on the face of the government but
still they are afraid now work order on
the Constitution or democracy
gaurav enough I just want to ask you and
the Congress party how are you so sure
that Alabama was going to order a very
why Prime Minister is so scared coming
from Mojave AIIMS we are saying that the
lukewarm I lost seventy seven days he
should be given the extension by seventy
seven days he should be because Supreme
Court is saying he should give them with
the principle of natural justice say he
should be given an opportunity of being
guard but nothing we will pass the order
we will kill the institutions of two
institution don't worry because we don't
want to form a joint director and the
CBI in casing is also in the studio's
affair Islam I'll come to you mr. Singh
this is a question to you the point that
Congress is raising that the principle
of natural justice was not used here
because a looper MA was not given a
chance to present his case before the
selection committee is that a
requirement because he was given a
chance to speak before the CBC there is
no provision in the law and that
director CBI will be given a chance to
represent his case before any decision
is taken by this high-powered committee
to to tinker with his tenures or fir to
remove human trafficking there is no
such thing under the law so that was not
required but considering there was so
much controversy around him would it
have been better to take him on board at
least give him a chance to present his
case to make it appear that this was a
fair decision that has taken today
taken place today I don't know it can be
said or cannot be said because after all
the papers were there and let us let us
be very very very very clear and you
think there is no such provision of this
highest powered committee takes a
decision on the basis of consensus that
will be desirable but on the basis of
majority and they have taken a decision
that he should not continue in the sky
so legally now I let me complete the
Holte legally now mr. Barba's removal
cannot be questioned on legal point CBI
has won the case because the CIA let me
go across to suffer Islam he's been
trying to make a boil phenomena between
the law country Abaza for Islam see
Mahad
this is also being highlighted by the ex
officer that this committee high-powered
Committee is not a committee to
investigate the matter is this committee
is committee to take a to take a call to
take some decision based on the
documents or information provided to
them CBC has provided all the
information to this high-powered
committee and CVC did give a fortunately
to mr. Verma to present and the
Honorable Supreme Court after when they
delivered the verdict two days ago the
Supreme Court had given only one week
for this committee to take it that mr.
Singh has also made is that the case was
won by elope Verma for the simple reason
that the government's decision to send
him on leave you know what the Congress
says midnight co was wrong illegal no no
no no no if the government's looking
caution he's also know he recommendation
but what what the Honorable Supreme
Court observed that the actual descent
should be taken by these high-powered
companies exactly so the my part
committee
that he was sent on yeah make my peace
with what prayer our local Mahadev grows
disreputable not on the merit or demerit
of his removal whether he could be done
at dot he couldn't do it him before the
Supreme Court his point was on his 10th
was on his consent Albert that he his
removal was illegal accompanied by
several circumstances midnight operation
he being asked you a fix to attend your
cannot be disturbed without it was woman
calls also that was the contention okay
and Supreme Court said will confine only
to that okay and so it said it was
illegal
all right suit had said that that the
way Arlo karma was removed in the
midnight that was illegal now the same
that the government wat prime ministry
seeing in two hours he had proved that
there is a financial charge against mr.
Arlo Karma there is a bribe taken by mr.
Arlo karma I read o grant Aamir Khan
suteki catotti okay okay what kind of
Investigation you guys are going to do
so so Mohammad Sidique eg you know it's
all about reading between the lines here
my question as a citizen here is why
isn't the Modi government allowing him
to function if he was not doing his duty
right then he should have been
completely removed shunted out why is he
demoted to d IG firearms if CVC charges
they are not even substantiated
there is no panel substantiating what
CVC charged so therefore if he is guilty
and if he's a black market person why is
he even allowed to be the de aramas let
the reason reading between the lines is
the Modi government is scared he will
come in for the repeal scam will be
exposed all right
because yes I always to investigate
there was another panelists that was
joining us this evening on face off
Vidya Shankar Pandey former secretary
Government of India is also here with us
Vijay Shankar Pandey as NK Singh has
pointed out former joint director and
CBI that there is no requirement per se
for the person in this case elope Varma
who is under the scanner to present his
case the high-powered committee can take
a decision independent of what his views
are but because this matter had assumed
this larger-than-life proportion becomes
so controversial would it have been wise
on part of the committee to have given a
chance to a local man to present his
case let me tell you very clearly that
as far as you know appointment or
selection of officials is concerned at
any level there is no requirement of
anybody being asked to come and present
his case before the committee so as far
as I understand as far as the law stands
as far as the procedure stand as well
the competence
it's a question of the committee
considering the case on the basis of the
facts available before them and take a
call on the issue in this case as
honorable Supreme Court desire thus this
committee must meet within a week and
discuss they should look at all the
facts and take a call on the issue
whether hello Pharma can be allowed to
continue or can be removed
you know the whole whole issue arose
from one one point whether the PM or the
CBC be competent to remove mr. Verma or
send him on leave the Supreme Court
opened and gave its judgment that the
high-powered Committee should have been
called before taking any such action and
that's why they quash the order now on
the basis of the
recommendation or the order of the
Supreme Court the committee met and
committee considered so let me make one
point very clear there was no need or
any kind of you know opportunity being
given to CBI the facts available before
them and if we have to we have to have
faith in the committee headed by prime
minister and attended by a Honorable
Supreme Court judge okay you know there
may be a dissenting wise so let's look
at these facts very clearly all right
NK Singh I want to come across to you
once again because there have been
transfers that have been done by
Nageshwar Rao the intimacy we achieve
those transfers were averted
after a loafer mine back as the CBI
chief what will happen next nobody knows
this kind of churning or what many would
call drama continues and this does not
augur well for the institution to be a
mockery of the Constitution
I'll come to your bus yes good not
saying that CPI severe has suffered a
big setback I mean it has become
non-functional I mean there has been no
director for 70 days or so special
director was sent relief in a very ugly
sir comes way it all this was done now
you know I personally feel that mr.
Baris would have waited for this
committee's decision this is my personal
view okay but but it CBA causes
repetition is suffered but who was
responsible for harming the reputation
of Islam who was responsible for this I
have an answer for that I come to you
yes Zephyr Islam who is responsible for
bringing the CBI into disrepute today
the as Abbas is saying a mockery that
the CBI has been made in two off
transfers then transfers being stopped
and having no a chief and interim acting
chief is heading the premier
investigating agency who was responsible
for this let me if you have if you just
do a back testing of las how what
happened unfolded in 3-4 months
the two senior officers the c2 senior
officers are making were making
allegations against each other I mean
this was unprecedented and the
government of the day based on the
recommendation of the CVC had to take a
call because you cannot keep continue to
see this situation in October itself why
was that not done the hype
so big up they coming to take a call
based on the recommendation of CVC nor
the DA the Honorable Supreme Court has
said that the matter should be discussed
with by the panel the panel today
discussed it and tell you that Vijay
Shankar Pandey sure could this situation
have been avoided had the high part
selection committee met and looked into
this allegations and taken a call in
October itself what it has done today
you know you know this is very clear
that the whole case of infighting
between the senior moves of surrendering
and next one it has been mishandled by
committee very sorry to say that because
you know you can't you can't have a
situation where two people top two
people keep on fighting fighting against
each other for months on you know in
this case six seven months ago something
about something against asana and the
comment you just kept on walking
silently it's very very sad state of
affairs the way things are being done
immediate access should have been taken
a bus wanted to make a point on who is
responsible for this chaos that we are
seeing presently in the CBI and
unannounced the CBI will have to wait
for another seven to ten days to have a
new director maja
tell you what is happening the citizens
of this nations are confused and they
have lost complete faith in the Central
Bureau of Investigation at a time
to take pride and what a formidable
institution that we have with us now but
unfortunately it's gone to the dogs
and let me tell you with the wall all we
see is CBI versus CBI the Congress
versus the BJP aliquot mamas is Rakesh
Astana we see so many can of worms
coming out there's so much of
mudslinging happening where did it start
it started right away with a look what
am i coming into the case where he was
removed overnight so there is question
why was why did that happen
then interim chief another interim chief
drama mercury a lot more sense suspense
than even a Bollywood movie that is all
government may go ahead maja
what is the to find a new that is also
the Mandate of the a la forma there are
so many allegations against him his crew
his credibility has been questioned is
integral allegations against Rakesh us
can also give you want even a director
the government of course their
high-powered committee did discuss about
it whether somebody with the
questionable integrity
sum it up as I see it first of all the
problem was created then the government
having created that problem remain
indifferent they did not know how to act
what to do about it
and finally when they decided to
intervene they hushed up the bust of the
whole thing and did everything illegally
and a very crude manner through this
midnight operation etcetera
now Alok Burma is a bad buy today who
appointed out of Burma there was a car
guy had opposed him because he had never
worked in the CBI he had no prior
experience and our Kazakh was senior to
him but today is that today again I was
already in the CBI a tried and tested
officer senior to a low Burma who was
due for promotion suddenly when the
previous director Sinha retired he was
sent out hunted out of ma che and Astana
was made interim director he continued
for three months and when the
appointment committee I mean the
promoted committee met it was pointed
out that the case was there that he
should be appointed okay but by two into
one two by one they appointed I know
Burma okay sure and this is how the
trouble started when when they started
fighting yes I have to take a very quick
break before that I'd quickly want to
take a question with Arunima Arunima the
government having burnt its fingers
would want to tread very cautiously now
correct
well especially so that you know it's an
election year Alok Varma's issue he has
now become political Congress party is
alleging a low Pharma has been removed
because of Rafael not because he was
corrupt not because they were any
allegations what they're going to also
say is that if I look Varma was corrupt
what was Rakesh astana at one point the
government thought both officers must be
sent relief today you've removed a low
Pharma but Astana continues to be one
leaf secondly what the question is being
asked is that if tribal society have
found allegations of corruption where is
the f ir against Alec Varma ultimately
whether he is DC bi whether he is a
central leave officer or not fact is if
there are allegations of corruption
against him under the Prevention of
Corruption Act the CBI should have
registered an F IR because he was a
government servant where is that if IR
hm
that's a very important point I'll take
a very quick break I'll come back for
more on this which is I'll come back to
you I'll come back to you we're taking a
quick break will now get you some of the
main highlights of the CVC report and
what it says CNN news 18 has accessed
the CVC report the conduct of Alok Varma
is suspicious in the Moines Qureshi case
but let me read out some of the other
lines here it says that there is however
no direct evidence on the allegation of
payment of bribe of two crores to Sri
hollow Parma by Shri Satish Sunna the
next point that it highlights is that
the next allegation rather is excluding
a suspect from a fire in the IRCTC case
it finally says that this if this
allegation is not substantiated transfer
of bank fraud case related to Sri Rajiv
Singh the den JD CBI what it says in
this case is that there is inordinate
delay in finalizing the investigation
report by CBI director Alok Verma the
next point that we are bringing for you
smuggling of gold at IG Airport New
Delhi the allegation is partially
substantiated and another point attempt
to induct tainted officers into CBI the
allegation is substantiated and guessing
out of the ten allegations here there
are at least four to five which are not
even substantiated in the CV
report so based on this report if the
decision has been taken today this
report I mean was there before the
Supreme Court as well but it was not
something that the Supreme Court looked
at right no no it did not go into this
okay it made it very clear so it left it
to this high-powered committee know
about this report as for the CBS charges
but much concerned
none of them has been substantiated
taking bribe this that and all that know
about remaining charges has they had to
be looked into he's a director CBI you
know he antagonizes many very important
people powerful people and so they may
be making motivated okay without giving
him charge without proper investigation
and inquiry you don't allow him to
complete his tenure okay Ivan I feel
very one of the points that was made by
one of the panelists what about Rakesh
has done after all it is the fight
between the 1-800 in Syria that's what I
am saying is government ready to remove
any officer on the basis of allegation I
am going to put three allegation on
Prime Minister is he going to resign
tonight
is he someone is going to remove him on
the basis of allocation till that time
allocations are not proved there is no
basis of allegation and you are saying
from the CVC report you are quoting that
most of the allegations are not
substantiated then on what basis the
allegations are was hold true by one
rebel prime minister today in two hours
the country wants to know first thing
second thing I am asking again and again
sees of that Supreme Court while making
his order as a illegal of second the CBI
chief don't you think maha that Supreme
Court had not seen at all the CVC report
had is that support is not very
flattering while I'm saying that some of
the points are not substantiated
at least in one case in the moon Qureshi
case it says that it establishes a
conduct of Chicago for my suspicion my
question to you who is DG fire is a
fault to come if it is substantiated why
fire is not registered today evening why
he is not behind bar you are saying DG
fire is okay but cbhi harlot entire
country and season please near be cocky
yes go ahead
this no no the at the argument is being
made by mr. Gore Abunda I think he must
understand the limitations this
high-powered committee has the hike up
our committee cannot investigate eyes he
is his native asaji the high-powered
committee can only take a call to
appoint somebody to remove somebody or
transit somebody the the high-powered
committee the Supreme Court observed
that the process which has been followed
by the government by sending him Damon
Lane was right but that the appropriate
process would be that the high-powered
Committee of the panel should should
discuss it and take a call and that's
why they said this high-powered
committee should take a call within a
week within a week's time the base on
the dock of the village is providing
information I have required advise CBC
and indeed get opportunity to appear to
see me see and present his case okay
there are many serious charges you want
him to go ahead yes yes so my simple
question is here why is there so much of
confusion it's either black or it is
white why the grey route if in the case
of moon karashi
a low karma is found to be guilty with
established suspect substantiated proved
by the CVC why is he still remaining the
di Gio for firearms I think he should be
shunted out removed completely why would
you know using for government is
government field that only important
even in a fall to post criminal kocourek
a post parameter speak why are you
repeating you are repeating same
question time and again and other stress
respond as well saying I am NOT saying
whether DJ the DJ fire services is is a
bad job or good job I am not commenting
on that what I am trying to tell you
that at least Sameer director and the
director should not have integrity all
the charges which has been gone through
pandey the question that is being asked
here is that this was a fight between
the number one and number two action has
been taken against number so just a
second sir for Islam see you know we are
discussing the case of an informer and
his removal today so you know it's a you
know this the moon had to be you know
done by a high-powered committee hi pod
committee met today and took a call or
mr. Aukerman yes the fate of mr. Rana is
not known yet he has been sent on these
along with mr. Oliver ma let's wait for
some time because I know I know very
well in case mr. O Hara is also not
given the same treatment and mr. Obama
has been given
then the serious questions will be
raised because you can't have people of
disputed dignity in a organization like
make one point that some police are
arguing
you totally substantiated other charges
in association I will say one thing you
know any person sitting down you know
organization like CBI has to have so I
fully endorse taken by the high poverty
in removing him from the position
because some charges did get stuck with
him as far as the CBC report and the
report package comes okay alright so for
Islam the question that the Congress
party is also raising is that because
Alok Varma was going to order inquiry
into this action against him was taken
in October

moment elope are my husband's actors the
CBI chief questions are being raised as
to what happens to the other person

break more coming up stay with us
